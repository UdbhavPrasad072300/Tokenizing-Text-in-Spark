"[Hello,"
"Manchester,"
and
I
am
thrilled
to
be
in
the
great
state
of
New
Hampshire
with
thousands
of
hardworking
patriots
who
believe
in
"God,"
"family,"
and
country.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
And
I'll
tell
you
what
—
we
have
more
in
this
"arena,"
and
I
hate
to
say
this
to
you…
we
have
more
than
this
outside
of
the
arena
trying
to
get
in.
So
if
you'd
like
to
give
up
your
seat
or
where
you're
standing…
Sorry
we
couldn't
get
you
"seats,"
but
if
you
want
to
give
it
"up,"
let
them
come
"in,"
you
go
out.
Does
anybody
want
to
make
that
deal?
I
don't
think
so.
But
we
have
more
in
this
arena
and
outside
of
this
arena
than
all
of
the
other
"candidates,"
meaning
the
"Democrats,"
put
together
and
multiplied
times
fave.
And
the
fake
"news,"
these
guys
will
never
report
that.
They'll
never
report
it.
They
don't
even
like
showing
the
crowd.
They
always
show
my
face.
They
never
show
the
crowd.
But
you
know
what?
The
people
can
hear
the
crowd.
The
people
can
hear
the
crowd.
They
know.
That
is
not
the
sound
of
200
people.
One
of
their
prime
candidates
"today,"
they
worked
a
big
deal.
They
had
exactly
104
"people,"
and
the
fake
news
"said,"
"\"It"
was
a
nice
crowd.
Very
"nice.\""
If
I
had
one
empty
seat
"here,"
one
empty
seat
in
this
massive
"arena,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"He"
didn't
sell
"out.\""
But
you
know
what?
We
have
never
had
an
empty
seat
from
the
day
your
future
first
lady
and
I
came
down
the
escalator.
"Never,"
not
one
time.
And
we
have
the
biggest
arenas
in
the
country.
With
your
help
on
November
3rd
we
are
going
to
defeat
the
radical
socialist
Democrats.
We
are
going
to
win
New
Hampshire
in
a
landslide.
This
is
a
truly
incredible
time
for
America.
We
have
the
best
economy
we've
ever
"had,"
the
most
prosperity.
We
have
got
the
most
prosperity
we've
ever
had.
By
the
"way,"
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
"way,"
"too,"
if
it's
"okay,"
who
was
"mumbling,"
very
"distracting,"
very
distracting.
It's
true.
You
"know,"
it
was
very
distracting.
I'm
speaking
and
a
woman
is
mumbling
terribly
behind
"me,"
angry.
There
was
a
little
anger
back
there.
We're
the
ones
that
should
be
"angry,"
not
them.
We're
the
ones
that
should
be
"angry,"
but
we
proudly
declared
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
American
comeback.
Our
country
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before.
And
the
day
after
my
"address,"
our
good
Republicans
in
the
United
States
Senate
voted
to
reject
the
outrageous
partisan
impeachment
hoax
and
to
issue
a
"full,"
"complete,"
and
"absolute,"
total
acquittal.
And
it
",wasn't"
even
close
and
I
want
to
thank
our
Republican
senators
and
our
Republican
House
members.
They
were
tremendous.
In
the
"House,"
we
won
196
to
nothing
and
then
we
got
three
Democrats.
And
in
the
"Senate,"
other
than
"Romney,"
we
got
52
to
"nothing,"
52
to
nothing.
That's
"something,"
and
in
one
case
we
got
53
to
"nothing,"
but
I
don't
even
count
that
to
be
honest.
The
radical
left's
pathetic
partisan
crusade
has
completely
failed
and
utterly
backfired
with
18
votes…
think
of
that…
18
votes
to
"spare,"
with
a
lot
of
votes
to
spare.
And
also
very
"importantly,"
as
of
"today,"
I…
"we,"
because
it's
not
we.
It's
not
I.
It's
we.
We're
all
in
this
together.
We
have
the
highest
poll
numbers
that
we
have
ever
had.
Thank
"you,"
"Nancy,"
very
much.
Thank
you.
While
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
America's
time
with
this
vile
"hoax,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
"borders,"
and
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
From
our
rural
communities
to
our
"cities,"
we
are
expanding
the
blessings
of
America
to
all
of
our
citizens.
We
added
another
"225,000"
new
jobs
last
month
alone.
Amazing.
And
I
listened.
I
watched.
I
had
all
these
experts.
They
were
"saying,"
"\"Yes,"
I
think
"60,000.\""
Another
one
said
"101,000."
Another
one
said
125.
Another
one
was
118.
And
then
the
number
came
"out,"
"225,000."
Pretty
good.
Pretty
good.
We
have
destroyed
the
ISIS
caliphate.
We
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
ISIS.
Al-Baghdadi
is
dead.
Al-Baghdadi
is
"dead,"
and
we
just
took
out
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
Qasem
"Soleimani,"
ending
his
evil
reign
of
terror
forever.
The
fact
"is,"
America
is
respected
again.
It's
been
a
long
time.
But
as
we
keep
on
"winning,"
Washington
democrats
keep
on
losing
their
minds.
They're
crazy.
That's
why
millions
of
registered
Democrat
voters
are
leaving
their
party
to
join
our
movement.
They're
joining
our
great
Republican
party.
"Now,"
I
can't
tell
you
what's
happening
tomorrow
because
you
know
you
have
some
pretty
strange
election
laws
"here,"
right?
Remember
last
time?
We
won
the
primary
tremendously.
We
should
have
won
the
"election,"
but
they
had
buses
being
shipped
up
from
"Massachusetts,"
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
buses.
And
it
was
"very,"
very
close
even
though
they
"did,"
but
this
year
we
have
a
great
"governor,"
Governor
Sununu.
Great
"governor,"
Chris.
And
now
you
get
prosecuted
if
you
do
what
they
"did,"
so
it
should
be
a
lot
different.
But
we
have
done
great.
This
has
been
an
incredible
state
for
us.
It's
a
state
where
the
people
are
"great,"
just
great
people.
And
we
hear
that
there
could
be
because
you
have
crossovers
in
"primaries,"
don't
you?
So
I
hear
a
lot
of
Republicans
tomorrow
will
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
possible
of
the
Democrats.
Does
that
make
sense?
You
people
wouldn't
do
that.
My
only
problem
is
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
their
weakest
candidate?
I
think
they're
all
weak
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth.
We
proudly
welcome
and
embrace
voters
of
all
parties
and
political
persuasions
who
want
to
join
our
mission.
A
very
simple
"mission,"
remember?
Make
America
great
again.
And
then
after
we
make
it
great
"again,"
which
we
already
have…
We've
had
141
days
where
the
stock
markets
have
reached
their
all-time
historical
high.
"141,"
think
about
it.
Out
of
three
"years,"
141.
And
to
"me,"
I
view
it
differently.
"Well,"
look
at
your
401ks.
I
"mean,"
who
is
doing
well
with
their
401k?
Up
90%.
Up
104%.
Is
there
anybody
doing
badly
with
the
401k?
I'd
like
to
not
talk
to
that
person.
Does
anybody
have
a
401k
where
they're
doing
"badly,"
please?
"Oh,"
don't
put
up
your
hand.
I
don't
believe
it.
"Nah,"
the
"401ks,"
they're
up
"90%,"
95%.
I
always
tell
this
story.
People
come
up
to
me.
They
"say,"
"\"I"
want
to
thank
you.
My
wife
thinks
I'm
a
total
"loser,"
sir.
She
thinks
I
am
the
worst
person
with
"money,"
with
financial.
She
thinks
I'm
just
horrible.
In
the
last
three
"years,"
I'm
up
"94%,"
sir.
She
thinks
I'm
a
total
genius
when
it
comes
to
finance.
She
loves
me
again.
She
didn't
love
me
"before,"
sir.
She
loves
me
"again.\""
That
tells
you
something
about
"money,"
doesn't
it?
The
first
step
to
victory
in
November
is
tomorrow.
Go
send
a
message
that
Republicans…
And
you
can
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
if
you
want.
Don't
worry
about
it.
I
don't
really
think
we
actually
have
a
candidate
against
us…
that
Republicans
are
"energized,"
that
we're
"united,"
and
that
nine
months
from
now
we
are
going
to
take
back
the
House
of
Representatives.
We
are
going
to
hold
the
Senate
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
White
House.
You
"know,"
they
always
talk
about
the
Democrats.
They
have
"enthusiasm,"
right?
We
have
so
much
more
enthusiasm
than
them.
It's
not
even
close.
They're
all
fighting
each
other.
They're
all
going
after
each
other.
You
got
them
all
over
the
place.
They
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing.
They
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
They
can't
even
count
their
votes.
We're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
many
great
leaders
from
across
this
state
and
this
"country,"
great
national
leaders.
I
want
to
thank
our
tremendous
Vice
"President,"
Mike
"Pence,"
who
spoke
earlier
this
evening.
And
also
with
"us,"
our
warrior
"senators,"
the
two
people
that
wanted
to
be
here.
They're
going
to
be
here
tomorrow.
They're
going
to
be
here
to
get
out
the
vote.
I
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
too
much
about
"it,"
but
that's
okay…
And
very
highly
"respected,"
Senators
Lindsey
Graham
and
Rand
Paul.
Great
guys.
"Warriors,"
they're
warriors.
"Hey,"
Lindsay
and
Rand.
That's
not
bad.
Can
you
imagine
if
you
actually
came
from
New
Hampshire
what
it
would
be?
Right?
That's
not
"bad,"
but
they
have
been
great.
All
they
do
is
they
looked
at
everybody
for
the
last
couple
of
months
and
they
"said,"
"\"Read"
the
transcripts
please.
Read
the
"transcripts.\""
But
I
want
to
thank
you
both
very
much.
Two
great
"people,"
two
great
friends.
"Man,"
look
at
all
that
television
back
there.
Whoa!
That's
bigger
than
those
terrible
Academy
"Awards,"
I've
got
to
tell
you.
That
used
to
be
big.
Not
so
much
anymore.
A
friend
of
"mine,"
another
great
leader
and
somebody
that's
going
to
be
Speaker
of
the
House
hopefully
next
"year,"
Kevin
McCarthy.
Our
"leader,"
Kevin
McCarthy.
"Oh,"
will
that
be
nice
to
have
"Kevin,"
a
pro.
You'll
see
things
get
done
like
you'll
never
believe.
Thank
"you,"
"Kevin,"
very
much.
Great.
A
very
brave
man…
He
took
a
bullet.
He
got
shot
and
he
got
up.
He
was
going
to
die
that
night.
I
tell
this
story
all
the
time.
His
"wife,"
she
was
crying
so
much.
When
he
finally
did
"awake,"
I
"said,"
"\"Well,"
one
thing
I
"learned,"
your
wife
loves
"you.\""
"\"Why"
do
you
say
"that?\""
"\"Because"
she
was
"devastated.\""
I
know
many
wives
that
don't
get
too
upset.
His
wife
was
devastated.
His
family
was
devastated.
The
doctor
told
me
he
didn't
have
a
good
"chance,"
but
he's
tough
as
hell
and
he's
a
really
terrific
friend.
He's
a
winner.
He
put
himself
back
into
shape.
He
actually
looks
better
now
than
he
did
before
he
got
shot.
Steve
Scalise.
Lot
of
guts.
Your
NRCC
"Chairman,"
"Mr,"
Tom
Emmer.
"Congressman,"
thank
you.
Tom
Emmer.
Thank
"you,"
Tom.
And
Representatives
Mark
Meadows.
Did
anybody
ever
hear
of
Mark
Meadows?
These
are
warriors.
Matt
Gates.
Matt.
Whoa!
Not
"bad,"
Matt.
That's
not
bad.
Mike
"Johnson,"
great
lawyer.
Mike
Johnson.
Thank
"you,"
Mike.
And
a
man
with
a
very
familiar
last
"name,"
Greg
"Pence,"
the
brother
of
Mike.
Thank
you.
Thank
"you,"
Greg.
And
thanks
also
to
New
Hampshire
Senate
Republican
"leader,"
Chuck
Morse.
Thank
"you,"
Chuck.
Thank
you.
And
I
see
"somebody,"
two
great
"people,"
a
great
couple
in
the
"audience,"
Matt
Schlapp
and
Mercedes
Schlapp.
They
are
warriors
also.
They're
warriors
also.
And
I
see
next
to
"them,"
two
warriors.
"Corey,"
you
just
are
such
a
fighter.
You
are
such
a
fighter.
"Ah,"
"boy,"
if
we
could
get
him
to
run
for
"Senate,"
he
would
win
so
easily.
Corey
"Lewandowski,"
who
loves
this
state
a
lot.
And
Dave
Bossie.
Thank
"you,"
David.
Thank
"you,"
David.
Great
job.
I'm
just
picking
these
people
out
of
the
audience.
We
have
everybody
here.
The
New
Hampshire
House
Republican
"leader,"
Dick
Hinch.
Thank
"you,"
Dick.
Thank
"you,"
Dick.
A
man
who's
been
with
us
right
from
the
beginning…
When
I
left
here
last
"time,"
I
felt
so
good.
Everybody
coming
up
to
the
"room,"
"\"you're"
going
to
win.
You're
going
"to…\""
We
win
by
a
"lot,"
right?
We
had
actually
a
total
of
"18,"
and
we
won.
We
had
a
tremendous
night
and
I've
never
forgotten
it.
And
there
was
a
friend
of
"ours,"
Chairman
of
the
New
Hampshire
Republican
"party,"
Steve
Stepanek.
Steve
Stepanek.
That
was
a
big
evening.
And
three
friends
of
mine
that
are
"co-chairmen,"
Al
"Baldasaro,"
Fred
Doucette…
"Baldasaro,"
Fred
"Ducette,"
and
Lou
Gargiulo.
Thank
you
all
very
much.
And
David
and
"Corey,"
thank
you
also
for
being
here.
Also
a
woman
that
not
too
many
people
know.
Very
"powerful,"
very
"smart,"
very
beautiful
even
though
I'm
not
allowed
to
say
that
because
she's
my
"daughter,"
Ivanka.
Fred
Ducette
and
Lou
Gargiulo.
Thank
you
all
very
much.
And
David
and
"Corey,"
thank
you
also
for
being
here.
Also
a
woman
that
not
too
many
people
know.
Very
"powerful,"
very
"smart,"
very
"beautiful,"
even
though
I'm
not
allowed
to
say
that
because
she's
my
"daughter,"
Ivanka.
Come
here.
Come
on
"up,"
Ivanka.
And
Jared
who's
making
deals
that
are
so
good
for
this
"country,"
people
have
no
idea
what's
happening.
I
will
tell
"you,"
we
are
making
trade
deals
and
other
deals
the
likes
of
which
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
Jared
Kushner.
Thank
"you,"
Jared.
Thank
you.
And
"Kimberly,"
thank
you
so
much.
I
heard
your
speech
on
the
plane
on
the
way
in.
I
was
very
impressed.
And
did
Don
Jr.
make
a
good
speech?
Come
on.
They're
good
kids.
They
went
through
a
lot
with
this
"hoax,"
I
want
to
tell
you.
They
went
through
a
lot
with
the
hoax.
Helping
us
was
the
RNC
"chairwoman,"
Ronna
McDaniel.
Great
job.
I
"said,"
"\"Get"
me
the
woman
from
Michigan
to
head
up
the
RNC!
Who's
that
woman
from
Michigan
to
head
up
the
"RNC?\""
Thank
"you,"
Ronna.
Great
job.
Setting
all
kinds
of
"records,"
polling
"records,"
contribution
"records,"
everything.
We're
doing
everything
so
it's
great.
And
Tommy
Hicks.
I
want
you
to
say
"hello,"
Tommy
"Hicks,"
who's
a
special
friend.
And
Haley.
Thank
"you,"
darling.
I
retweeted
"you,"
Haley.
I
retweeted
you
all
over
the
place.
And
all
together
we're
building
the
world's
most
prosperous
economy
and
the
most
inclusive
society
anywhere
in
the
world.
It's
a
great
thing.
It's
a
great
thing.
Since
my
"election,"
America's
gained
7
million
new
jobs.
The
unemployment
rate
has
hit
the
lowest
rate
in
half
a
century.
The
average
unemployment
rate
under
my
administration
is
lower
than
any
previous
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country.
You
believe
that
one?
That's
pretty
amazing.
That's
pretty
amazing.
The
unemployment
rate
among
African
"Americans,"
Hispanic
"Americans,"
and
Asian
Americans
has
reached
record
"lows,"
all
"time,"
never
been
lower
than
what
it
is
now.
And
by
the
"way,"
our
poll
numbers
with
African
"Americans,"
with
Hispanic
"Americans,"
with
Asian
"Americans,"
the
other
side
is
getting
a
little
nervous
because
they
are
like
rocket
ships.
They're
going
up.
African
American
youth
unemployment
is
so
important.
It
was
a
horrible
number
a
few
years
ago.
You
"remember,"
it
was
a
really
terrible
thing
was
happening.
It's
just
reached
the
lowest
time
in
the
"history,"
"lowest,"
the
best
number
in
the
history
of
our
country.
And
African
American
poverty
numbers
have
hit
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded.
Wages
for
African
American
workers
have
increased
by
"$2,400"
per
"year,"
also
a
record.
And
you
know
this.
For
"decades,"
the
Democrat
party
has
betrayed
African
Americans.
They
betrayed
us
all.
They
betrayed
all
of
us.
But
we're
delivering
for
African
Americans.
We're
delivering
for
Asian
Americans
and
Hispanic
Americans
like
nobody
has
ever
done.
We
are
fighting
for
great
"jobs,"
great
"schools,"
great
"healthcare,"
and
a
truly
great
future
for
our
country
and
for
them.
We
are
the
party
of
equal
opportunity
for
all
Americans.
Thank
you.
To
support
working
"families,"
we've
reduced
the
cost
of
"childcare,"
expanded
paid
"leave,"
and
given
40
million
American
families
an
average
of
"$2,200"
more
in
their
pockets
thanks
to
the
Republican
child
tax
credit.
Who
would
have
thought
that?
We
have
cut
more
job
killing
regulations
than
any…
You
know
this
one.
So
you
go
back
four
"years,"
eight
years.
In
one
"case,"
longer
than
eight
years.
We've
cut
more
job
killing
regulations
than
any
other
administration
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
and
we're
not
finished.
We've
ended
the
war
on
American
energy.
They
want
to
take
our
energy
away.
They
want
to
take
our
wealth
away.
They
want
to
give
us
wind.
Wind.
If
it
"blows,"
wonderful.
If
it
doesn't
"blow,"
you
got
problems.
Wind.
They
want
to
destroy
our
"countrysides,"
put
windmills
all
over
them.
Watch
your
house
go
down
in
value.
You
ever
see
what
happens?
They
build
a
windmill
within
distance
of
your
house.
You
could
forget
about
your
house.
You
could
just
"say,"
"well,"
that
was
the
end
of
that
investment.
You
want
to
see
a
bird
"graveyard,"
go
to
the
bottom
of
a
windmill.
Take
a
look.
It's
a
graveyard
for
birds.
They
kill
all
the
birds.
Lowering
utility
bills
and
reducing
prices
at
the
"pump,"
that's
what
we're
doing.
We
are
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
"policies,"
Washington
politicians…
You
know
this.
They
shuttered
New
Hampshire
factories.
You
were
one
of
the
worst
examples
ever.
"NAFTA,"
what
NAFTA
to
your
"communities,"
I
mean
to
your
"state,"
is
incredible.
Shattered
your
communities
and
sacrifice
your
jobs
on
the
altar
of
globalism.
We
can
forget
globalism.
We
want
to
take
care
of
our
country.
New
Hampshire
alone
lost
one
in
four
manufacturing
jobs
following
that
twin
disaster
of
NAFTA
and
China's
entrance
into
the
"WTO,"
the
World
Trade
"Organization,"
one
of
the
truly
bad
deals
ever
made
in
the
history
of
our
country.
For
"decades,"
politicians
campaigned
across
this
state
promising
to
replace
NAFTA.
They
lied.
They
never
did
it.
They
never
even
tried
to
do
it.
They
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
anyway.
It
wasn't
"easy,"
I
will
tell
you
that.
But
then
they
got
elected
and
they
did
absolutely
nothing.
But
I'm
not
like
those
other
politicians.
I
keep
my
promises.
We
took
care
of
it.
We
took
care
of
it.
You
saw
last
month
being
bye-bye.
I
say
Donald
J.
"Trump,"
bye-bye
NAFTA.
We
ended
the
NAFTA
catastrophe
and
I
signed
the
brand
new
US
Mexico
Canada
Agreement
into
law.
That's
going
to
be
great
for
our
"manufacturers,"
our
farmers.
Great
for
everybody.
Great
for
our
workers.
The
USMCA
will
bring
jobs
back
to
New
Hampshire
right
where
they
belong.
They
should
have
never
left
in
the
first
place.
Probably
the
number
one
reason
I
ran
for
office.
I'm
one
for
one.
I
have
friends.
Some
of
these
great
"senators,"
look
at
Lindsey
over
there
and
look
at
Rand.
These
great
senators.
"Sure,"
I've
run
five
times
and
I've
won
three.
And
other
senators
said
"\"Sir,"
I've
won
seven
"times,"
"sir.\""
Southern
senator.
"\"I"
won
seven
"times,"
"sir,"
and
I've
won
five
of
those
damn
"contests.\""
I
"said,"
"\"Senator,"
I
ran
once
and
I
won
just
"once.\""
And
we're
going
to
run
twice
and
that's
going
to
be
it.
Although
they
think
we're
going
to
run
much
more
than
"that,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
It
scares
the
hell
out
of
the
fake
"news,"
I
will
tell
you.
They
can't
take
a
joke.
I
also
took
the
strongest
ever
action
to
confront
China's
massive
theft
of
American
"jobs,"
and
our
strategy
worked.
Massive
tariff
and
tariff
money
is
pouring
in
and
has
poured
"in,"
poured
in
by
the
billions
and
billions.
We
never
took
in
25
cents
from
China.
They
ripped
us
so
much
you
wouldn't
believe
it.
Now
they
respect
us
again.
Last
month
we
signed
a
groundbreaking
trade
agreement
with
China
that
will
defeat
so
many
of
our
opponents.
The
money
that's
pouring
"in,"
people
don't
even
believe
it.
And
by
the
"way,"
the
"virus,"
they're
working
hard.
Looks
like
by
"April,"
in
theory
when
it
gets
a
little
"warmer,"
it
miraculously
goes
away.
I
hope
that's
"true,"
but
we're
doing
great
in
our
country.
"China,"
I
spoke
with
president
Xi
and
they're
working
"very,"
very
hard
and
I
think
it's
going
to
all
work
out
fine.
Rough
"stuff,"
I
tell
you.
"Rough,"
rough
"stuff,"
but
I
think
it's
going
to
work
out
good.
We
only
have
11
cases
and
they're
all
getting
better.
But
our
trade
agreement
with
China
will
defend
our
"workers,"
protect
our
intellectual
"property,"
and
substantially
boost
exports
of
American
made
goods.
Is
that
nice?
After
years
of
building
up
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
country.
On
no
issue
of
Washington
Democrats
more
thoroughly
sold
out
the
American
people
than
a
thing
called
"immigration,"
right?
Before
I
came
into
"office,"
the
far
left's
policy
of
open
borders
allowed
deadly
drugs
to
flow
freely
into
our
country
and
that's
what
they
want.
I
see
them
campaigning
right
down
the
street.
It's
really
boring
to
"watch,"
but
I
try
and
watch.
"No,"
I
have
an
obligation
to
watch
really
boring
stuff.
But
they
want
open
borders.
They
want
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
to
pour
into
our
"country,"
many
of
whom
are
not
exactly
what
we're
looking
"for,"
okay?
I
mean
"murderers,"
"rapists,"
and
some
other
things.
They're
going
to
be
poisoning
our
children
with
"drugs,"
including
right
here
in
New
"Hampshire,"
and
you
have
one
of
the
drug
problems
in
the
country.
And
we
brought
it
down
18%
but
we
have
to
do
better.
18%.
Washington
Democrats
put
the
needs
of
illegal
immigrants
before
the
wellbeing
of
American
citizens.
They
want
to
let
anyone
into
our
country
from
all
around
the
world.
Just
come
on
"in,"
"folks,"
we're
going
to
give
you
free
healthcare.
We're
going
to
give
you
free
education.
We're
going
to
give
you
more
than
our
vets
are
getting.
Every
family
will
get
a
free
Rolls
Royce.
You
know
I
said
"that,"
Matt.
I
said
that
to
them
and
some
of
the
fake
news
picked
it
up
and
they
"said,"
"\"President"
Trump
said
every
family
coming
into
our
country
illegally
gets
a
brand
new
free
Rolls
Royce.
He
lied.
He
lied.
He
"lied.\""
They
gave
me
a
Pinocchio.
They
don't
get
"it,"
"Matt,"
do
"they,"
Matt?
Actually
they
get
it
better
than
we
understand.
They
get
it
very
well.
They
get
it.
They
know
what's
happening.
And
the
wall
is
being
built.
I
will
tell
you
the
wall
is
being
built.
And
you
know
they
went
after
us
on
everybody
knows
the
wall
is
going
up.
So
what's
happening?
You
do
know
who's
paying
for
the
"wall,"
don't
you?
Right.
Redemption
from
illegal
aliens
that
are
coming.
The
redemption
money
is
paying
for
the
wall.
They're
so
sad
to
hear
that
because
it's
"okay,"
"finally,"
they
go.
You
have
to
understand
an
entire
party
is
fighting.
They'll
give
me
anything
I
want.
Our
military
would
rebuilt
it.
"2.2,"
it's
really
$2.5
trillion
over
a
period
of
three
years.
They
give
me
anything
but
not
25
cents
for
the
wall.
They
"said,"
"\"We"
like
"drones.\""
"Well,"
drones
don't
keep
people
out.
Drones
are
wonderful.
They
fly
"around,"
take
pictures.
We're
going
to
give
you
a
drone.
No
good.
So
we
now
have
built
over
100
miles
of
wall.
And
when
we
have
that
wall
"built,"
you
have
to
see
what
happens
to
the
illegal
aliens
that
don't
come
in.
I
say
they
can't
come
in.
They
don't
come
in.
So
we
up
to
over
a
"hundred,"
substantially
more
than
a
hundred
miles
of
"wall,"
and
we'll
have
close
to
500
miles
of
wall
in
the
very
near
future.
And
by
the
"way,"
you
have
to
see.
You
wouldn't
believe
it.
You
have
to
see
what
happens
when
that
wall
goes
up.
You
have
to
see
the
numbers
change
like
magic.
They
change
like
magic.
You
ever
hear
the
thing
with
all
the
modern
"technology,"
all
of
the
new
"computers,"
the
new
"genius,"
the
new
"everything,"
cyber
"this,"
cyber
"that,"
two
things
never
"change,"
right?
A
wheel
and
a
wall.
Right?
A
wheel
and
a
wall.
They're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
brilliant
people
working
over
the
years.
They're
never
going
to
replace
the
wheel
and
they're
never
going
to
replace
the
"wall,"
and
it's
a
high
wall.
Illegal
immigrants
coming
"in,"
coming
into
our
country
"illegally,"
very
few
of
them
are
getting
in
right
now.
Mexico
has
been
terrific.
We
have
"27,000"
Mexican
soldiers
on
our
border
and
the
numbers
went
down
87%
from
this
year
and
this
time
last
year.
And
for
the
amount
of
money
Washington
Democrats
want
to
spend
supporting
illegal
"immigrants,"
we
could
rebuild
the
cities
in
America.
We
could
rebuild
our
cities.
But
I
have
"something,"
because
people
were
screaming
to
me
for
the
last
four
or
five
"rallies,"
read
the
snake.
The
snake.
Does
anybody
know
what
I'm
talking
about?
She
knows.
She's
been
standing
outside
for
four
"days,"
no
wonder.
And
you
look
"good,"
I'll
tell
you
what.
Four
days
outside
in
the
rain
and
snow.
Look
at
these
front
row
people.
These
are
warriors.
They're
warriors
"too,"
like
my
congressmen
and
senators.
I
made
minor
changes.
They
mentioned
illegal
immigration.
This
is
about
immigration.
This
was
a
song
from
the
"1950s,"
Al
Green.
And
they
mentioned
little
changes
to
"it,"
that's
okay.
But
they
mentioned
illegal
"immigration,"
right?
And
I
used
to
do
this
a
lot
and
people
couldn't
get
enough
of
"it,"
to
be
honest
with
you.
And
I
haven't
done
it
for
a
"while,"
and
I
thought
I'd
do
it
tonight
because
you're
on
the
eve
of
giving
us
an
opponent
and
all
of
these
people
want
open
borders.
They
want
open
"borders,"
and
we
don't
want
open
borders.
We
want
very
strong
closed
borders.
And
we
want
people
to
come
into
our
"country,"
but
they
want
to
come
in
through
merit
and
we
want
them
to
come
in
"legally,"
right?
Right?
Through
merit
and
legally.
Right?
So
we'll
do
this
quickly.
This
is
illegal
immigration.
It's
called…
"Oh,"
listen
to
how
quiet
it
is.
Listen
to
how
quiet.
Now
watch
how
quiet
it
gets.
Gets
so
quiet.
But
this
is
all
about…
I
love
you
too.
That
was
a
guy
that
said
"that,"
but
I
love
him
too.
I
love
everybody.
Ready?
So
important.
Illegal
immigration.
On
our
way
to
work
one
morning
down
the
path
along
the
"lake,"
a
tender
hearted
woman
saw
a
poor
half
frozen
snake.
His
pretty
colored
skin
had
been
all
frosted
with
the
dew.
"\"Poor"
"thing,\""
she
"cried,"
"\"I'll"
take
you
in
and
I'll
take
care
of
"you.\""
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven's
sake.
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
the
vicious
snake.
She
wrapped
him
up
all
cozy
in
a
comforter
of
silk
and
laid
him
by
her
fireside
with
some
honey
and
some
milk.
She
hurried
home
from
work
that
night
and
as
soon
as
she
"arrived,"
she
found
that
pretty
snake
she'd
taken
in
had
been
"fully,"
fully
revived.
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven
sake.
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
that
vicious
snake.
She
clutched
him
to
her
bosom.
"\"You're"
so
"beautiful,\""
she
cried.
"\"But"
if
I
hadn't
brought
you
in
by
"now,"
you
truly
would
have
"died.\""
She
stroked
his
pretty
skin
again
and
kissed
him
and
held
him
tight.
But
instead
of
saying
thank
"you,"
the
snake
gave
her
a
vicious
bite.
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven's
sake.
Take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
the
vicious
snake.
"\"I"
saved
"you,\""
cried
the
"woman,"
"\"and"
you've
bitten
"me,"
but
why?
You
know
your
bite
is
poisonous
and
now
I'm
going
to
"die.\""
"\"Shut"
"up,"
silly
"woman,\""
said
the
reptile
with
a
grin.
"\"You"
knew
damn
well
I
was
a
snake
before
you
took
me
"in.\""
Got
to
come
in
legally
and
through
merit.
Under
my
administration
we're
fully
taking
care
of
our
own
citizens
"first,"
including
millions
of
African
American
and
Hispanic
Americans
who
are
entitled
to
a
government
that
protects
their
families
and
their
communities.
In
this
region
of
the
country
alone
last
"year,"
ICE
officers…
We
love
our
ICE
officers.
The
Democrats
don't
like
them.
The
Democrats
don't
like
them.
ICE
officers
are
the
toughest
human
"beings,"
and
they
love
the
country
as
much
as
anybody
in
this
room.
Last
year
alone
they
…
in
this
room.
Last
year
"alone,"
they
arrested
over
"2,000"
criminal
aliens
charged
or
convicted
of
dangerous
offenses
including
"robbery,"
"rape,"
and
murder.
Over
"2,000"
accused
of
"murder,"
yet
left
wing
politicians
support
sanctuary
cities
that
release
criminal
aliens
directly
into
the
American
community.
One
of
guests
at
the
State
of
the
Union
was
American
"citizen,"
Jody
Jones.
I
introduced
him
that
night.
His
beloved
"brother,"
"Rocky,"
was
murdered
by
a
criminal
alien
in
"California,"
shot
him
eight
times
at
close
"range,"
wouldn't
stop.
Rocky's
killer
had
been
previously
arrested
"many,"
many
"times,"
but
under
California's
totally
insane
and
outrageous
sanctuary
"law,"
authorities
were
ordered
to
set
him
free.
"Tragically,"
left
wing
politicians
in
New
Hampshire
tried
to
replicate
California's
disastrous
policies.
Last
"year,"
the
Democrat
controlled
New
Hampshire
house
blocked
legislation
that
would
have
banned
sanctuary
cities
in
your
state.
And
by
the
"way,"
you
have
a
great
"governor,"
Chris
Sununu.
He's
on
top
of
it.
He's
on
top
of
it.
And
his
father
is
a
great
guy.
His
father
didn't
like
me
too
much
a
few
years
ago.
Once
I
"won,"
I'm
telling
"you,"
he
was
so
good.
He
was
as
good.
He
fought
like
hell
for
"us,"
all
of
us.
It's
a
great
"family,"
and
Chris
is
doing
a
fantastic
job.
If
you
want
to
shut
down
sanctuary
"cities,"
if
you
want
to
protect
your
family
and
your
loved
"ones,"
you
must
vote
Republican
in
"2020,"
November.
And
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
eight
straight
months
in
a
row.
Illegal
crossings
are
down
now
at
record
numbers
and
we've
ended
catch
and
release.
You
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
You
catch
an
illegal
alien
by
law.
You
then
take
his
name
and
address.
They
don't
have
addresses.
What's
your
address?
What?
They
don't
have
addresses.
They
come
into
the
"country,"
they
don't
have
addresses.
So
you
take
his
name
and
then
you
have
to
release
him
into
the
country
and
you
"say,"
"\"We'll"
see
you
in
four
years
for
your
court
"case.\""
We
never
see
them.
They
never
come
back.
We
have
seized
record
amounts
of
drugs.
We
have
deported
record
numbers
of
gang
"members,"
MS-13
by
the
thousands.
And
we
have
done
more
to
secure
the
border
of
our
country
than
any
administration
in
history.
…
Does
anybody
know
who
won
Iowa?
I
don't
know.
Maybe
"Rander,"
Lindsey.
"Grant,"
does
anybody
know
who
won?
"Lindsey,"
you're
a
total
pro.
Nobody
knows.
He
said
nobody.
Flip
a
coin.
Flip
a
coin.
Flip
a
coin.
They're
going
to
run
your
health
care.
Unbelievable.
Nobody
knows
who
won.
"Actually,"
I
think
they're
trying
to
take
it
away
from
Bernie
again.
I
think
Bernie
came
in
second.
Can
you
believe
it?
They're
doing
it
to
you
"again,"
Bernie.
They're
doing
it
to
you
again.
We're
saving
your
healthcare
while
these
socialist
Democrats
are
trying
to
take
away
your
healthcare.
We
are
making
healthcare
better
and
"much,"
much
cheaper.
You've
seen
what
we
did.
We
are
protecting
people
with
preexisting
conditions
and
we
always
will.
The
Republican
party
always
will.
Always
will.
And
we
got
rid
of
the
most
unpopular
thing
in
the
healthcare
"world,"
the
individual
mandate.
We
had
to
pay
a
fortune
not
to
have
pay
a
fortune.
You
paid
a
fortune
not
to
pay
a
fortune
for
bad
healthcare.
And
we
got
rid
of
"it,"
saved
a
lot
of
money
for
a
lot
of
people.
And
we're
stopping
surprise
medical
bills
and
making
everything
transparent.
That's
bigger
than
healthcare
transparency
and
that'll
go
unfortunately
into
effect
right
around
the
election
time.
It
would
be
nice
if
we
could
get
it
"earlier,"
but
it's
all
done.
It's
all
signed.
Because
when
providers
are
required
to
show
you
what
the
prices
"are,"
those
prices
are
going
to
come
tumbling
down.
Blood
tests
as
an
"example,"
one
hospital
has
them
for
$53.
Another
"hospital,"
the
same
"test,"
"$2,415."
Same
exact
test.
And
it
may
even
be
"better,"
who
knows?
We're
approving
more
generic
drugs
than
ever
before
at
any
time
in
the
history
of
our
country.
That's
bringing
prices
down.
We
are
defending
your
right
to
keep
the
doctor
and
to
keep
your
plan.
Remember
President
"Obama,"
you
could
keep
your
plan.
You
could
keep
28
times.
You
can
keep
your
doctor.
That
didn't
turn
out
very
good.
We
should
impeach
him
for
that.
Why
aren't
we
impeaching
him?
28
"times,"
you
can
keep
your
doctor.
We
should
impeach
President
Obama.
Democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
The
Republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
American
"worker,"
the
American
"family,"
the
American
"dream,"
and
the
late
great
Abraham
"Lincoln,"
right?
Abraham
Lincoln.
Republicans
are
fighting
for
citizens
from
every
"background,"
every
community
and
every
walk
of
life.
We
are
the
party
of
boundless
"optimism,"
"excitement,"
"energy,"
and
enthusiasm.
We
love
people.
We
are
asking
all
Americans
to
join
our
incredible
movement.
People
are
signing
up
left
and
right.
But
if
you
want
to
vote
for
a
weak
candidate
"tomorrow,"
go
ahead.
Pick
one.
Pick
the
weakest
one
you
"think,"
I
don't
know
who
it
is.
We
are
a
big
party
with
big
ideas
for
the
future.
Very
big.
We
become
a
big
party
and
an
open-minded
party
and
we're
the
party
that
people
like.
We're
the
hot
party
and
we're
the
party
with
all
the
enthusiasm.
We
are
fighting
for
school
choice
because
no
parent
should
ever
be
forced
to
send
their
child
to
a
failing
government
school.
Right?
We
pass
criminal
justice
reform
to
give
former
prisoners
a
second
chance
at
life.
Most
incredible
thing
that's
happened.
Prisoners
never
really
had
a
shot.
They'd
get
"out,"
they
couldn't
get
a
job
no
matter
what
they
"did,"
and
they'd
go
back.
They'd
go
back
to
their
ways.
I
"mean,"
in
many
cases
I
guess
they
had
no
choice.
It
was
a
disaster.
Now
they're
getting
out
and
because
our
economy
is
so
good
and
because
of
what
we've
done
with
criminal
justice
reform
and
other
things
like
"opportunities,"
"zones,"
et
"cetera,"
they're
getting
jobs
and
employers
are
loving
them.
They're
doing
great.
They're
doing
great.
They
are
doing
great
first
time
ever.
They're
not
going
back.
To
uphold
the
rule
of
"law,"
we
have
confirmed
191
federal
judges
who
will
interpret
the
Constitution
as
written.
And
as
you
"know,"
we've
also
confirmed
two
great
new
Supreme
Court
justices.
Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
"you,"
Grant.
Thank
"you,"
Lindsey.
Thank
you.
We
have
invested
$2.2
trillion
to
rebuild
the
United
States
"military,"
as
I
"said,"
and
I
love
saying
it
because
we
are
funding
for
New
"Hampshire,"
the
New
Hampshire
Army
National
Guard
readiness
centers
just
a
few
miles
from
here
in
Pembroke
and
in
Concord.
"Concord,"
I
love
Concord.
I
love
Concord.
"Oh,"
Concord.
You
know
how
famous
Concord
is?
Concord.
That's
the
same
Concord
that
we
read
about
all
the
"time,"
right?
Concord.
I
love
Concord.
I
recognized
Israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
American
embassy
in
Jerusalem.
And
we
recognize
Israeli
sovereignty
over
the
Golan
"Heights,"
been
trying
to
do
that
for
52
years.
We
got
it
done.
And
for
years
you
watched
as
your
politicians
…
They
"really,"
I
"mean,"
they
went
"out,"
"\"I'd"
like
to
apologize
for
the
behavior
of
the
United
"States.\""
"No,"
no.
We
don't
know
we
don't
apologize
anymore.
We
don't
apologize.
Now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
America
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
people
of
New
Hampshire.
Thank
you.
At
stake
in
our
present
battle
is
to
survival
actually
of
our
nation.
If
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
blessings
that
generations
of
Americans
have
fought
and
died
for
to
"secure,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
November
"3rd,"
2020.
Only
this
way
can
we
save
the
America
we
love
and
drain
the
Washington
swamp
once
and
for
all.
And
I
will
tell
"you,"
that
swamp
is
much
worse
than
I
thought
when
I
was
out
here
innocently
campaigning.
Let's
drain
the
swamp.
That
swamp
is
a
lot
worse
than
anybody
ever
thought.
That
swamp
is
that
dirty
swamp.
That's
a
dirty
swamp.
You
have
some
really
"evil,"
"dirty,"
horrible
people.
Like
to
say
"nice,"
everyone's
nice.
They're
not
good.
They're
not
good
people.
But
we're
draining
that
sucker
slowly
but
surely.
With
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
of
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
independence
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
"Together,"
we
will
elect
a
Republican
Congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
We
will
continue
to
enact
new
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
phrase
Made
in
the
USA.
We
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
ending
the
AIDS
epidemic
in
America
in
less
than
10
years.
How
about
that?
It'll
be
done.
We
will
land
the
first
woman
in
the
moon
and
become
the
first
nation
in
the
world
to
plant
its
flag
on
Mars.
We're
very
advanced.
All
made
in
the
USA.
We
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to-
…
keep
and
bear
arms.
We're
going
to
protect
your
Second
Amendments.
By
the
"way,"
they're
going
to
take
away
everything.
They're
going
to
take
away
your
wealth.
They're
going
to
take
away
your
guns.
They're
going
to
take
away
everything.
Above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
America.
We
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States.
We
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
We
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
We
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
American
way.
We
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
American
flag.
We
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
"\"In"
God
we
"trust.\""
From
Nashua
to
"Dixville,"
from
Portsmouth
to
"Plymouth,"
from
Concord
to
"Claremont,"
and
from
Meredith
to
right
here
in
"Manchester,"
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
red-blooded
American
Patriots
who
poured
out
their
"heart,"
"sweat,"
and
soul
to
secure
our
liberty
and
defend
our
freedom.
New
Hampshire
was
founded
by
tough
frontier
men
and
"strong,"
powerful
pioneer
women
who
defied
the
dangers
and
raised
their
children
to
embrace
the
eternal
"motto,"
"\"Live"
free
or
"die.\""
I
love
that
motto.
Live
free
or
die.
These
courageous
Americans
tamed
the
"wilderness,"
braved
the
"elements,"
changed
the
"hills,"
fought
the
"battles,"
and
helped
make
this
the
greatest
nation
ever
to
exist
on
the
face
of
the
Earth
and
we
are
making
it
greater.
Every
single
"day,"
greater
than
ever
before.
Proud
citizens
like
you
helped
build
this
country
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
We
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
American
people.
That's
what
this
is
all
about.
With
your
"help,"
your
"devotion,"
and
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
We
are
going
to
keep
on
fighting
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
We
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
God.
America
is
thriving
like
never
before.
And
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
New
"Hampshire,"
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
Together
we
will
make
America
wealthy
again.
We
will
make
America
strong
again.
We
will
make
America
proud
again.
We
will
make
America
safe
again
and
we
will
make
America
great
again.
Thank
"you,"
New
Hampshire.
Thank
you.]
"[Oh,"
thank
you
very
"much,"
everybody.
Thank
you.
"Well,"
thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
very
much.
And
considering
that
we
caught
President
Obama
and
sleepy
Joe
"Biden,"
spying
on
our
"campaign,"
"treason,"
will
probably
be
entitled
to
another
four
more
years
after
that.
I
wanted
to
thank
"you,"
and
Art
and
"Brandon,"
you're
incredible.
I've
known
you
now
a
long
time.
Right
from
the
"beginning,"
we
had
the
"chemistry,"
we
had
that
good
chemistry…
"Oh,"
sit
down.
It's
122
degrees
in
this
place.
And
we
have
our
great
Governor.
"Governor,"
can
we
make
it
a
little
"bit,"
just
a
little.
This
is
like
a
test.
You
think
Joe
Biden
could
do
this?
I
don't
think
so.
So
I'm
thrilled
to
be
in
"Yuma,"
Arizona
To
proudly
accept
the
endorsement
of
the
National
Border
Patrol
"Council,"
that's
a
big
deal.
And
they
are
great
friends
of
mine.
And
we're
building
the
wall.
Next
"week,"
we'll
be
up
to
300
miles
of
incredible
wall.
And
our
numbers
are
the
best.
We
are
very
tough
at
the
border.
When
people
want
to
come
"in,"
for
our
"farmers,"
et
"cetera,"
et
"cetera,"
we're
not
going
to
hurt
our
"farmers,"
but
we've
never
had
better
numbers
than
we
have
right
now.
And
that's
been
helped
because
we're
at
a
little
bit
over
280
miles
right
"now,"
we
have
never
been
helped
like
this.
"Wall,"
there
are
two
"things,"
in
a
thousand
years
you
can
come
"back,"
two
things
will
"never,"
with
technology
it's
obsolete
before
you
even
put
it
in
the
"box,"
but
two
things
never
get
old
wheels
and
walls.
Wheels
and
wall.
If
you
come
back
in
a
thousand
"years,"
you'll
"say,"
"\"Well,"
we
still
have
wheels
in
"walls.\""
And
that's
the
only
thing
you'll
recognize.
The
National
Border
Patrol
Council
is
the
official
union
representing
the
incredible
heroes
of
the
United
States
Border
Patrol.
They've
been
my
friends
from
the
beginning.
To
every
border
"agent,"
and
I
just
met
some
unbelievable
people
"backstage,"
these
are
great
"people,"
and
every
family
member
here
"today,"
you
have
earned
the
everlasting
gratitude
of
our
nation.
And
I
want
to
thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
very
much.
As
you
"know,"
better
than
"anyone,"
the
survival
of
our
nation
is
at
stake
in
this
election.
And
I
will
tell
"you,"
I
never
thought
I'd
say
it
because
we
had
a
great
election.
We
had
a
great
election
a
little
while
ago.
Four
years
"ago,"
I
never
thought
I'd
say
anything
could
compete
with
2016.
This
election
that
we're
going
into
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
because
we
had
crooked
"Hillary,"
but
this
is
"something,"
these
people
are
sick.
And
we
have
to
make
sure
that
this
radical
left
socialist
and
"beyond,"
because
this
is
beyond
"socialism,"
that
it
doesn't
"happen,"
or
we
will
indeed
have
Venezuela
on
steroids.
So
we
can't
do
it.
Most
important
"election,"
November
"3rd,"
get
out
and
vote.
Joe
Biden
is
the
puppet
of
the
radical
left
wing
movement
that
seeks
the
complete
elimination
of
America's
borders
and
boundaries.
They
want
to
take
the
wall
"down,"
they
don't
want
to
have
"borders,"
they
want
to
have
sanctuary
"cities,"
lots
of
bad
things
they
want.
Following
orders
from
his
boss.
I
guess
his
new
boss
is
Bernie
Sanders.
Can
you
believe
that?
Crazy
Bernie.
Joe
Biden
has
pledged
to
abolish
immigration
"enforcement,"
suspend
all
"removals,"
provide
free
government
"healthcare,"
and
they
want
to
give
it
to
illegal
aliens.
You
don't
get
it.
"Restore,"
catching
and
release.
Shield
violent
criminal
aliens.
This
is
what
they
want
to
do.
And
give
every
illegal
alien
on
the
planet
earth
a
free
ticket
to
invent
an
asylum
"claim,"
and
gain
automatic
admission
into
our
country.
We
will
have
people
coming
into
our
country
that
never
even
thought
of
it
before.
You
get
free
"education,"
you
get
free
"healthcare,"
why
wouldn't
they
come?
Let's
go
to
America.
The
Biden
plan
would
unleash
a
flood
of
illegal
immigration
like
the
world
has
never
seen.
It's
crazy.
Biden's
plan
is
the
most
"radical,"
"extreme,"
"reckless,"
"dangerous,"
and
deadly
immigration
plan
ever
put
forward
by
a
major
party
candidate.
It
must
be
"defeated,"
and
it
will
be
defeated
on
November
3rd.
It
will
be
defeated.
At
last
night's
Democrat
"convention,"
which
by
the
"way,"
got
very
bad
"ratings,"
I
have
to
tell
you.
Unity.
They
talk
about
unity.
They
want
to
bring
unity.
And
then
you
listen
to
Michelle
Obama's
"speech,"
which
was
obsolete
by
the
time
it
got
there.
She
taped
it.
"No,"
she
taped
the
speech.
It
was
obsolete.
She
must
have
taped
it
about
three
weeks
before.
I'm
speaking
next
"Thursday,"
maybe
I'll
tape
it.
But
I
don't
think
that
goes.
That's
so
much
"nicer,"
to
tape
"it,"
you
do
"it,"
nice
air
conditioned
room.
And
she
not
only
taped
"it,"
but
tell
me
when
you
hear
a
divisive
speech…
They
talk
about
me
as
being
a
divider.
I'm
not
a
divider.
I
bring
people
together.
We
were
bringing
people
together.
We
were
bringing
people
"together,"
like
never
before.
Success
was
bringing
everyone
"together,"
and
then
we
got
hit
with
the
China
"virus,"
but
we
were
bringing
people
together.
But
one
of
the
opening
speakers
last
night
said
that
America
will
go
to
hell
if
we
don't
have
open
borders.
Think
of
that.
Go
to
hell.
When
a
country
doesn't
have
"borders,"
you
don't
have
a
country.
"Today,"
a
Democrat
speaker
at
the
convention
"said,"
"\"We're"
talking
about
abolishing
the
"police,"
we're
talking
about
abolishing
"ICE,"
we're
talking
about
abolishing
"prisons.\""
Biden's
campaign
has
turned
into
a
cult
for
open
border
and
others
Zealots.
By
the
"way,"
they
want
to
double
and
triple
your
"taxes,"
they
want
to
increase
"regulations,"
they
want
to
spend
very
little
money
on
our
"vets,"
after
we
took
care
of
our
vets
better
than
anyone's.
91%
approval
rate.
And
they
want
to
spend
much
less
on
our
"military,"
we've
totally
rebuilt.
Two
and
a
half
trillion
"dollars,"
we've
totally
rebuilt
our
military.
Bernie
Sanders
"declared,"
in
his
"speech,"
many
of
the
ideas
that
just
a
few
years
ago
were
considered
"radical,"
are
now
mainstream.
That's
Bernie
Sanders.
Because
"Joe,"
he
doesn't
know
where
he
is.
But
if
he
"did,"
he's
been
brought
so
far
left
that
our
country
will
not
be
the
country
that
we
know.
It
will
have
"problems,"
it
will
go
down.
Your
stocks
will
be
"gone,"
your
401ks
will
disappear.
And
right
"now,"
who
has
the
401k?
And
then
the
rest
of
"you,"
many
of
you
have
"stocks,"
and
you
do
it
a
different
way.
That
will
go
down
"50,"
"60,"
"70%,"
80%.
And
if
you
held
"on,"
like
I
said
to
"do,"
we
went
down
a
little
while
we
got
hit
with
a
virus.
"Now,"
NASDAQ
just
broke
an
all
time
record.
"SNP,"
just
broke
an
all
time
record.
Socialism
is
the
mainstream
of
the
Biden
campaign
and
it's
not
the
mainstream
of
America.
Remember
I
"said,"
we
will
never
have
a
socialist
country.
On
November
3rd.
The
people
of
"Arizona,"
our
great
"state,"
we
love
Arizona.
I
won
it
last
"time,"
by
a
lot.
And
I
hear
we're
going
to
win
it
by
even
more
this
time.
Don't
"forget,"
last
time
I
"talked,"
I
said
we're
going
to
give
you
a
tax
"cuts,"
I
gave
you.
I
"said,"
we're
going
to
give
you
a
massive
regulation
cuts.
Give
you
your
tax
"cuts,"
I
gave
them
to
you.
I
said
we're
going
to
give
you
massive
regulation
"cuts,"
we're
going
to
give
you
great
everything.
We
even
did
Right
to
Try
medicine.
You
know
all
about
that.
We
did
things
that
I
didn't
even
talk
about
"it,"
we
did.
We
did
a
thing
called
the
Space
Force.
You
never
heard
me
talking
about.
I'm
the
only
candidate
that
gave
you
more
than
I
promised
in
the
campaign.
It's
true.
I'm
the
only
one
"ever,"
maybe
ever.
Or
we'll
head
to
the
polls
and
together
we'll
stop
the
left
and
win
four
more
years
in
the
White
House.
We're
joined
today
by
some
incredible
"people,"
friends
of
"mine,"
"great,"
great
people.
And
I
want
to
congratulate
your
governor
because
we
had
a
spike
and
he
knocked
that
spike
out
so
fast.
I
don't
know.
Are
you
sure
you
even
had
a
spike?
Doug
"Ducey,"
a
great
"governor,"
great
"man,"
and
a
somebody
that
won
by
about
16
or
17
points.
That's
not
so
bad.
And
I
think
you're
more
popular
today.
What
a
job
you've
done.
Thank
you
very
"much,"
Doug.
A
friend
of
mine
and
somebody
who's
a
great
fighter
"pilot,"
and
I
had
a
lot
of
people
tell
me
she
could
really
wheel
the
"Warthog,"
right?
The
Warthog.
She
"said,"
"\"I"
love
that
"plane,\""
but
she
was
a
"great,"
great
fighter
"pilot,"
one
of
the
best
they
were
telling
me.
This
was
a
group
and
they
knew
a
very
well.
A
lot
of
friends
you
have.
And
specifically
she
"said,"
"\"Could"
you
extend
that
plane?
That's
the
best
plane.
It
never
breaks
down.
It
just
is
a
"winner.\""
But
Martha
McSally
is
an
extraordinary
"person,"
and
she's
fighting
for
"us,"
and
she's
helping
"us,"
and
we
have
to
bring
her
into
the
center.
Thank
"you,"
Martha.
And
she's
running
against
a
gentlemen
who
"is,"
when
you
read
what
he's
"done,"
when
you
read
what
he
said
about
the
second
amendment
and
about
all
other
"things,"
you're
not
going
to
want
to
vote
for.
You're
not
going
to
want
to
have
them
play
with
your
second
amendment.
I'll
tell
you
what.
If
I
weren't
"President,"
I
don't
"believe,"
"Doug,"
you'd
have
a
second
amendment
right
now.
I
don't
think
you'd
have.
The
pressure
that
was
put
on
to
get
rid
of
"it,"
or
to
basically
obliterate
"it,"
make
it
so
it's
meaningless.
You
will
always
have
the
right
to
bear
arms.
You
will
always
have
that.
A
few
friends
of
mine
who
are
warriors.
Paul
Gosar.
Paul.
Where's
Paul?
"Paul,"
stand
up.
Will
you?
Paul
Gosar.
Thank
"you,"
Paul.
Appreciate.
Great
job
you're
doing.
These
are
warriors.
They
really
are.
When
they
went
and
they
tried
to
make
a
play
at
your
"President,"
they
had
to
get
through
the
House.
What
were
we?
197
and
nothing.
That's
never
happened
before.
Everybody
came
together.
The
Republicans
came.
Other
than
Mitt
"Romney,"
one
half
a
vote.
One
half
a
brain.
Another
friend
of
mine
and
incredible
"fighter,"
and
somebody
that
loves
his
"state,"
and
I'll
tell
"you,"
the
Freedom
"Caucus,"
right?
And
we
have
a
man
named
Andy
Biggs
here.
He's
a
fighter.
He's
a
fighter.
And
he
loves
our
"vets,"
and
he
loves
our
"military,"
and
you
love
our
second
"amendment,"
right?
And
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
with
it.
They
will
destroy
that
second
amendment.
Just
remember
I
said
"it,"
but
you're
not
going
to
have
to
worry
about
it
because
it's
not
going
to
happen.
A
woman
who
really
distinguished
"herself,"
she
became
a
star.
She
became
a
star
overnight.
There
was
nobody
tougher.
There
was
nobody
smarter.
There
was
nobody
better
than
Debbie
Lesko.
Great
"job,"
Debbie.
Thank
you.
We
want
her
on
our
side.
Right
fellas?
We
got
to
have
her
on
our
side.
"Also,"
thanks
to
Arizona
Republican
party
"chairman,"
I
knew
this
was
going
to
happen.
I
knew
that
she
was
going.
She
never
stops.
She
never
gives
up.
Kelly
Ward.
"Kelly,"
thank
you.
Thank
"you,"
Kelly.
Great
job
you're
doing.
Are
we
winning?
"Okay,"
good.
I
think
we
are.
That's
what
they
say.
We
better
win.
If
we
don't
"win,"
this
country
is
in
big
trouble.
Big
trouble.
Also
a
great
friend
of
all
of
"ours,"
former
State
Treasurer
of
"Arizona,"
Jeff
DeWitt.
Thank
you
Jeff.
And
a
man
who
didn't
choke
under
pressure.
I
don't
even
know
if
he's
here.
I
think
he
might
be
here.
He
never
choked.
He
kicked
for
11
years.
You
know
what
that
is?
You
ever
see
a
golfer.
They
miss
a
three
footer.
They
miss
a
three
footer.
They
can't
take
it
back.
They
"choke,"
"choke,"
choke.
"Well,"
kickers
are
the
same.
Right?
NFL
kickers.
This
guy
lasted
11
years.
He's
one
of
the
best
kickers
ever.
NFL
"kicker,"
Jay
Feely.
Where's
Jay?
Where
is
Jay?
He's
here
someplace.
Where
is
he?
Jay?
What
happened?
You
couldn't
get
a
good
"seat,"
Jay.
I
remember
the
61
yarder.
That
was
a
heartbreaker.
Right?
But
the
only
thing
"is,"
I'll
bet
you
this
man
would
"stand,"
only
"stand,"
for
our
National
Anthem.
That's
one
thing.
That's
one
thing
I
can
tell
you.
And
if
they
don't
stand
for
our
"flag,"
if
they
don't
stand
for
our
National
"Anthem,"
I
turn
off
the
game.
Other
than
"that,"
I'd
like
to
"watch,"
but
I
turn
off
the
game.
And
by
the
"way,"
I
thought
they
learned
that
lesson
a
little
while
ago.
I
thought
they
learned
that
lesson
two
years
"ago,"
but
maybe
"not,"
but
they
will.
They'll
learn
it
again.
This
time
it'll
go
even
faster.
For
"decades,"
Washington
politicians
like
Biden
allowed
an
endless
supply
of
illegal
foreign
labor
to
decimate
American
jobs
and
wages.
"Also,"
the
crime
was
incredible
what
happened.
They
allowed
criminal
gangs
to
"menace,"
maim
and
terrorize
innocent
citizens.
They
came
in.
They
would
maim
and
"terrorize,"
and
we
have
done
something
with
our
border
patrol.
And
by
the
"way,"
"ICE,"
ICE
is
great.
ICE
has
taken
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
"MS-13,"
and
you
don't
want
the
job.
There's
some
tough
people
here.
None
of
you
want
the
job.
It's
a
tough
"job,"
but
they
like
"it,"
and
they're
great
"Patriots,"
and
they've
done
a
fantastic
job.
They
ceded
control
of
the
border
to
the
most
dangerous
and
ruthless
cartels
on
earth.
This
is
what
would
happen.
They
have
ceded.
And
what
we've
"done,"
did
you
ever
notice
the
caravans?
What
happened?
"Debbie,"
there
are
no
more
caravans.
What
happened?
What
happened
to
the
caravans?
They
don't
come
up
anymore.
The
caravans
don't
come
up.
You
"know,"
we
were
paying
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
"Honduras,"
"Guatemala,"
El
"Salvador,"
hundreds
of
millions.
And
I
"said,"
"\"Well,"
why
are
we
doing
"that?\""
And
they
wouldn't
take.
When
we
caught
a
murderer
and
we
wanted
to
bring
it
back
to
one
of
those
"countries,"
they
wouldn't
take
him.
And
they
wouldn't
take
him
under
the
Obama
administration.
So
we
got
stuck
with
them
because
they'd
fly
in.
They'd
"say,"
"\"Don't"
land
your
"plane.\""
And
I
said
something
very
simple.
I
"said,"
"\"That's"
okay.
We
don't
have
to
do
that.
We're
not
going
to
pay
you
anymore.
We
stopped
"payment.\""
We
stopped
payment.
It's
amazing
how
that
"works,"
Doug.
Right?
We
stopped
payment
and
they
called.
They
"said,"
"\"We'd"
love
to
take
them.
We'd
be
honored
to
take
"them.\""
So
we
take
them
back
by
the
"thousands,"
by
the
thousands.
They
let
lethal
poisonous
drugs
pour
freely
into
our
schools
and
our
"communities,"
but
no
more.
It's
not
happening
anymore.
The
cruel
and
heartless
portrayal
of
the
American
people
ended
the
day
I
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
and
now
that
we
have
more
than
half
of
the
wall
"built,"
and
do
you
notice
they
don't
talk
about
the
wall
anymore.
They
don't
talk.
Why
don't
you
talk?
I
"went,"
"\"Look"
at
all
those
people
back
"there.\""
That's
called
fake
"news,"
fake
news.
Look
at
them.
It's
the
fake
news.
They
don't
talk
about
the
wall
anymore.
"See,"
we
won.
We
got
the
wall.
It's
going
to
be
up
to
300
next
week
and
it's
going
to
be
finished
very
soon.
And
as
soon
as
we
"want,"
all
of
a
"sudden,"
they
never
talk
about
it.
But
you
know
where
I
talk
about
it?
Numbers.
The
numbers
are
so
good.
The
numbers
are
so
low.
We've
never
had
numbers
like
this
because
that
big
portion
of
wall
already
"built,"
you
don't
get
through
it.
You
can't
get
through
it.
You
can
climb
Mount
"Everest,"
and
you're
going
to
have
an
awful
hard
time
getting
over
that
sucker.
I
stood
up
to
the
lobbyists.
Everybody
fought
"us,"
the
"Democrats,"
everyone.
I
fought
the
special
interests.
I
kept
every
single
promise
that
I
"made,"
and
now
I'm
doing
it
with
the
drug
companies.
I
just
created
Favorite
Nation.
So
if
a
nation
buys
it
for
less
and
they
buy
it
for
a
fraction
of
what
we
"pay,"
the
drug
companies
have
to
sell
it
to
us
for
the
same
price.
And
they're
spending
so
much.
They're
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
advertising.
Anytime
you
see
an
ad
from
a
drug
"company,"
and
they're
"rich,"
the
"farmer,"
it's
called
Big
"Farmer,"
the
number
one
lobbyist.
They
spend
millions
and
"millions,"
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
online.
Anytime
you
"see,"
anytime
at
"all,"
you
see
an
ad
by
Big
Farmer
against
"me,"
you
know
your
drug
prices
are
coming
down.
That's
what
it
is.
They're
not
happy.
And
we're
giving
the
rebate
that
creates
tremendous
wealth
for
the
middle
"man,"
the
rebate.
It's
going
to
the
people
now.
We're
bringing
the
rebate
and
it's
going
to
the
people.
They
are
not
happy.
I
have
a
lot
of
people
in
that
industry
do
not
like
me
too
much.
But
you
are
going
to
get
50.
You
are
going
to
"get,"
and
the
Democrats
would
never
do
"it,"
Biden
would
never
do
it
because
he
doesn't
understand
"it,"
but
they
would
never
do
it.
They
would
in
a
million
"years,"
they
wouldn't
do
it.
It
took
a
lot
of
guts
to
do
it.
I
had
a
lot
of
"people,"
a
lot
of
good
politicians
"go,"
"\"Sir,"
I
don't
think
you
should
do
"it.\""
I
wonder
why
you're
saying
"that,"
but
we
did
it.
We're
going
to
have
drug
prices
reduced
over
a
very
short
period
of
"time,"
by
not
"2%,"
and
last
year
they
went
down
a
little
"bit,"
first
time
in
51
years
that
drug
prices
went
down
but
a
little
"bit,"
we're
going
to
have
prices
dropping
"50,"
"60,"
and
even
70%.
Drugs.
About
time.
And
I'm
proud
to
say
that
they've
achieved
the
most
secure
"border,"
our
border
"patrol,"
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
of
America.
We
now
have
the
most
secure
border
we've
ever
had
and
it's
only
going
to
get
better.
And
we
want
people
to
come
"in,"
but
we
want
them
to
come
in
through
"merit,"
right?
And
we
want
people-
…
people
to
come
"in,"
but
we
want
them
to
come
in
through
"merit,"
right?
And
we
want
people
that
are
going
to
come
in
and
are
going
to
love
for
our
"country,"
not
hate
our
country.
Here
in
"Yuma,"
"Arizona,"
we've
invested
over
$1.7
billion
and
poured
"180,000"
cubic
"yards,"
that's
a
lot
of
"concrete,"
to
build
108
miles
of
powerful
border
wall.
I
know
who's
going
to
vote
for
me.
I
don't
know
"though,"
I
think
I'm
going
to
win
Yuma.
What
do
you
"think,"
Doug?
I
"think,"
when
I
hear
those
"numbers,"
when
we
hear
those
"numbers,"
we're
winning.
We're
going
to
win
Yuma
big.
Now
you
see
it
and
you
see
what's
going
up
and
it's
an
incredible
"structure,"
all
"capable,"
all
wired
up
for
"cameras,"
for
everything
you
can
have.
Technology
is
incredible.
In
"total,"
I've
already
completely
planned
for
the
final
"execution,"
we're
going
to
"have,"
by
the
end
of
the
"year,"
everything
that
we
said
is
going
to
be
built.
We
may
actually
build
some
more
in
some
soft
areas
that
we've
noticed
over
the
last
two
years.
So
we
actually
may
put
up
some
"additional,"
but
we
will
have
it
"completed,"
everything
we
"said,"
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
And
we've
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
by
60%
since
this
time
last
year.
And
if
we
keep
going
at
the
"rate,"
it'll
be
about
85%
in
about
two
months.
So
it's
a
great
honor.
And
you
know
what?
Your
community
is
much
"safer,"
you
see
the
"difference,"
it's
a
much
safer
place
to
be.
But
more
important
than
these
numbers
is
the
fact
that
we've
ended
catch
and
release.
You
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
These
great
men
and
women
catch
"somebody,"
maybe
a
"murderer,"
maybe
a
"rapist,"
maybe
a
"trafficker,"
they
catch
"somebody,"
take
his
"name,"
take
his
number
and
they
release
them
into
our
country.
And
they
"say,"
"\"Come"
back
in
four
"years,"
you
have
a
"trial.\""
No
more.
We
take
them
out.
We
bring
them
out.
And
nobody
said
that
was
possible
because
I
couldn't
have
gotten
it
through
the
Democrats
because
they
don't
like
that.
So
we
have
people
coming
in
to
this
"country,"
some
great
"people,"
some
really
bad
people
too.
And
I
mean
murders
and
I
mean
"rapist,"
I
mean
really
bad
people
and
they
don't
get
in
and
they
don't
get
back.
When
we
bring
them
back
to
their
"country,"
could
be
Mexico
"also,"
they
don't
come
back.
Under
the
Obama
"Biden,"
I
call
it
"OBiden,"
Under
the
OBiden
"administration,"
our
agents
were
ordered
to
ignore
the
law
and
release
illegal
aliens
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands.
And
by
the
"way,"
Mark
"Morgan,"
where's
the
great
Mark
Morgan?
He's
around
here
someplace.
Mark
Morgan
has
been
so
"incredible,"
one
of
our
"executives,"
he
"said,"
"\"We"
never
built
the
cages.
Those
cages
were
built
in
2014
by
"Obama.\""
We
never
the
"cages,"
they
were
built
by
Obama
and
the
fake
news
is
constantly
saying
that
I
built
cages
for
children.
I
didn't
build
them.
They
were
built
in
2014.
There
was
a
headline
in
Time
magazine
about
the
cage
and
somebody
called
in
that
built
it.
They
"said,"
"\"He"
didn't
build
"it,"
we
built
that
for
the
Obama
"administration.\""
But
they
don't
"stop,"
they
keep
calling
"it,"
they
say
I
built
the
cages.
You'll
hear
it
in
one
of
the
debates.
They'll
"say,"
"\"You"
built
cages
"president.\""
I
"said,"
"\"No,"
I
didn't
build
cages.
That
was
built
by
"Obama.\""
Under
the
Trump
"administration,"
if
you
cross
our
border
"illegally,"
you
are
quickly
apprehended
and
swiftly
returned
back
home.
We
are
proudly
defending
the
job
safety
and
security
of
the
American
"people,"
which
is
what
I
promised
to
do.
Nobody
told
me
it
was
going
to
be
this
hard.
Nobody
told
me
I
was
going
to
have
the
Democrats
go
totally
crazy.
This
was
like
a
life
and
death
war.
You
know
why
they
don't
talk
about
it
anymore?
Because
they
know
it's
bad
"politics,"
because
they
know
having
a
"wall,"
they
can't
win
that
one.
So
they
just
"say,"
"\"Let's"
forget
it
ever
happened.'
Because
we
won
and
they
"say,"
"\"Let's"
"forget.\""
They
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
That
includes
the
millions
of
incredible
Hispanic
Americans
who
follow
our
"laws,"
uplift
our
community
and
protect
our
"nation,"
in
uniform.
Half
of
all
border
patrol
agents
are
Hispanic
"Americans,"
I
was
just
with
them.
And
today
I
salute
each
and
every
one
of
those
true
American
heroes
and
that's
what
they
are.
And
nobody
understands
the
border
better
than
Hispanics.
They
know
what's
"good,"
what's
bad.
They
don't
want
bad
people
coming
into
our
"country,"
taking
their
"jobs,"
taking
their
"homes,"
causing
crime.
Hispanic
Americans
are
the
people
that
are
most
in
favor
of
what
we're
doing
on
the
border
because
they
understand
it.
They
understand
it
better
than
anybody.
With
the
help
of
these
"patriots,"
we've
stopped
the
rampant
asylum
"fraud,"
shut
down
the
human
smugglers
and
we're
finding
the
drug
"dealers,"
"traffickers,"
"predators,"
and
we're
throwing
them
to
hell
in
jail
or
sending
them
back
home.
"MS-13,"
for
the
first
time
that
you've
ever
seen
"this,"
MS-13
is
totally
on
the
run.
Many
of
its
leaders
are
right
now
behind
bars
and
we're
deporting
its
members
in
record
numbers
we've
never
reported.
I
can't
believe
how
many
there
are.
But
if
Biden
"wins,"
it
will
be
a
giant
jail
break
for
MS-13
and
vicious
criminal
gangs.
China
wants
him
to
win
so
badly.
Iran
wants
him
to
win
so
badly.
When
we
"win,"
I'll
have
a
deal
with
the
red
within
a
"month,"
"watch,"
because
they're
dying
to
make
a
deal.
But
that
last
hope
that
Biden
will
"win,"
they
will
own
our
"country,"
"China,"
they
will
own
our
country.
We
made
such
a
great
deal.
Last
week
they
had
the
largest
order
of
corn
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
the
largest
single
order.
Then
they
did
it
again.
You
know
why
they're
doing
that?
Because
they
know
I'm
"angry,"
because
they
know
I
don't
care
so
much
anymore.
We
made
a
great
trade
"deal,"
but
I
don't
care.
But
it
shows
you
how
smart
they
"are,"
Doug.
Another
with
normal
brain
"power,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"Well,"
I'm
not
going
to
buy
any
more
"corn.\""
That's
good.
And
we'll
just
"decouple,"
thank
you
very
much.
But
they
go
the
opposite.
They
buy
so
"much,"
good
record
"numbers,"
soybeans
record
numbers.
Last
"week,"
biggest
"ever,"
42%
of
our
farmers
crop
is
now
"China,"
over
the
last
little
while.
You
know
why?
Because
they
don't
want
bad
things
to
"happen,"
that's
why.
So
they're
very
smart.
When
I
have
every
farmer
in
the
country
calling
and
"saying,"
"\"Please"
don't
do
"anything.\""
They're
"very,"
very
"smart,"
but
we
can
never
forget
what
China
did
to
this
country
and
did
to
the
world.
The
historic
achievements
that
I've
discussed
today
are
only
a
slim
fraction
of
the
extraordinary
accomplishment
that
we've
all
done
together
in
the
last
four
years.
Here's
just
a
short
list
of
our
landmarks.
Really
they
are
"landmarks,"
true
landmarks.
We
instituted
a
national
security
travel
ban
on
the
world's
most
dangerous
"regions,"
including
jihadist
"regions,"
keeping
terrorists
and
extremists
out
of
our
country.
Everyone
"said,"
"\"Oh,"
that's
so
"bad.\""
Remember
when
they
"said,"
"\"Oh,"
that's
so
"bad.\""
I
don't
think
it's
so
bad
at
all.
We
won
the
travel
ban.
The
fake
news
said
we
didn't
because
we
lost
in
the
lower
"court,"
we
lost
in
the
second
court
and
we
won
in
the
Supreme
court.
So
they
said
we
lost.
Can
you
believe
it?
They
said
we
lost
"Debbie,"
because
we
lost
the
first
"two,"
but
we
won
in
the
Supreme
"court,"
so
they
"said,"
"\"They"
"lost.\""
I
"guess,"
technically
they're
"right,"
we
lost
when
it
didn't
matter.
But
we
have
it.
We
have
a
great
travel
ban
now
for
countries
that
are
not
countries
where
we
want
the
people
coming
in.
Over
the
last
three
"years,"
ICE
officers
have
made
over
"380,000"
arrests
of
aliens
with
criminal
"records,"
including
those
charged
or
convicted
of
over
"145,000"
"assaults,"
"40,000"
sex
crimes
and
"5,"
800
murders.
Over
the
last
three
"years,"
border
patrol
and
ICE
have
seized
over
two
million
pounds
of
"fentanyl,"
"heroin,"
"meth,"
and
other
deadly
narcotics.
And
you
see
it
all
the
time.
We
stripped
federal
grant
funding
from
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
They
want
to
have
a
sanctuary
"city,"
not
going
to
be
like
the
old
days.
We
canceled
the
lawless
policies
of
the
previous
administration
and
empowered
border
agents
and
ICE
officers
to
do
their
jobs
and
proudly
enforce
the
laws
of
the
United
States
of
America.
We
removed
"20,000"
gang
"members,"
including
"4,500,"
MS-13.
That's
pretty
good.
Who
would
ever
think
there's
that
many?
I
entered
into
three
landmark
agreements
with
Honduras
and
El
Salvador
and
Guatemala
to
end
the
abuse
of
the
asylum
system.
We
cut
down
that
payment
that
I
was
talking
about
substantially
and
they're
still
very
happy
and
they
are
working
with
us
very
well
and
that
includes
Mexico.
Right
"now,"
Mexico
has
"27,000"
of
their
soldiers
on
our
Southern
"border,"
helping
us
to
guard
our
Southern
border.
And
we're
giving
you
the
tools
to
do
the
job
that
you
signed
up
for.
That's
what
we've
done.
I
entered
into
a
historic
partnership
with
"Mexico,"
known
as
the
migrant
protection
"protocols,"
to
safely
return
asylum
seekers
to
"Mexico,"
while
awaiting
hearings
in
the
United
States.
You
know
about
that.
We
had
to
have
them
in
the
United
States
and
we
captured
"them,"
we
had
to
keep
him
here.
I
"said,"
"\"No,"
"no,"
we
don't
want
them
here.
We
want
them
"outside.\""
We
got
sued
all
over
the
place
that
we
won.
So
now
they
don't
come
into
the
United
"States,"
they
can
wait
outside.
For
the
first
time
"ever,"
the
United
States
is
now
exercising
our
full
legal
authority
to
expedited
removal.
We
don't
have
to
go
through
years
and
years
of
litigation.
You
need
Perry
Mason
to
try
and
win.
We
ended
the
Obama
Biden
policy
of
giving
work
permits
to
newly
"arriving,"
illegal
aliens.
Think
of
that
one.
We
established
the
national
vetting
"center,"
the
most
advanced
visa
screening
"system,"
anywhere
in
the
world.
We
know
so
much
about
the
people
coming
in.
We
know
the
good
and
we
know
the
bad.
We've
suspended
refugee.
…
Good
and
we
know
the
bad.
We've
suspended
refugee
resettlements
from
the
world's
most
dangerous
"regions,"
because
nothing
is
more
important
than
keeping
America
safe.
To
"me,"
that's
number
one.
We've
made
historic
progress
to
crack
down
on
visa
overstays.
You
know
all
about
that.
They
overstay
for
years.
They
"say,"
"\"Maybe"
a
"night,"
maybe
two
"nights.\""
"Well,"
five
years
"later,"
you
catch
them.
"No,"
we
ended
it.
We
issued
strict
sanctions
on
countries
that
failed
to
take
back
their
own
criminals.
We
have
many
countries
beyond
the
four
that
I
"mentioned,"
the
three
plus
"one,"
many
countries.
They
all
take
them
back
now.
"Before,"
they
weren't
taking
them
back
at
all.
The
last
administration
simply
released
these
criminals.
We're
making
sure
they
go
home
and
we're
making
sure
they
stay
home.
We
don't
want
them.
We
issued
regulations
to
stop
the
horrible
practice
of
birth
tourism.
You
know
what
that
"is,"
right?
Anchor
"babies,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
Anchor
babies.
Have
a
baby
in
our
country
and
you
stay
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
Congratulations.
You're
a
citizen
for
90
years.
Then
you
bring
in
your
family.
You
bring
in
your
"family,"
right?
No.
No
good.
I
implemented
a
historic
public
charge
regulation
to
finally
and
fully
enforce
the
federal
requirement
that
newcomers
to
our
country
must
be
financially
"self-sufficient,"
they
cannot
accept
welfare
for
at
least
five
years.
To
protect
our
country
and
our
agents
during
the
"pandemic,"
my
administration
took
immediate
action
to
ensure
the
safe
and
rapid
return
of
all
illegal
aliens.
We
brought
them
back.
We
have
very
few
in
our
country
now.
We
brought
them
"back,"
can
you
believe
it?
To
protect
US
"workers,"
I
suspended
the
entry
of
low
wage
workers
that
threatened
all
of
your
"jobs,"
American
"jobs,"
and
we're
finalizing
the
new
H-1B
regulations
to
permanently
end
the
displacement
of
US
workers.
In
January
after
the
China
"virus,"
after
the
"outbreak,"
after
the
"outbreak,"
the
China
virus
"outbreak,"
it
came
from
"Wuhan,"
right?
I
swiftly
implemented
a
travel
ban
on
China
and
I
was
criticized.
"Biden,"
opposed
the
ban.
He
"said,"
"\"I"
oppose
the
"ban.\""
He
had
no
idea
what
the
hell
he
was
doing.
Why
do
you
oppose
"it,"
Joe?
I
don't
know.
They
told
me
to
say
that.
If
we
had
listened
to
Sleepy
Joe
"Biden,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
additional
American
lives
would
have
been
lost.
We
did
a
good
thing.
That
was
in
"January,"
I
imposed
"it,"
very
early.
A
month
"later,"
Pelosi
and
all
these
people
"said,"
"\"Oh"
"no,"
let
people
come
in.
We
"can't.\""
We
imposed
it
because
China
was
heavily
infected.
Then
I
imposed
it
in
Europe
"also,"
heavily
infected
with
Italy
and
France
and
Spain.
Compare
our
achievements
with
the
insane
and
lethal
policies
that
Biden
and
Bernie
Sanders
want.
The
entire
Biden…
Harris.
How
about
her?
Is
she
a
great
one?
Is
she?
By
the
"way,"
you
talk
about
guns.
She
wants
no
2nd
Amendment.
She
wants
to
raise
your
taxes
to
a
level
you'll
be
paying
your
government
back
for
a
long
time.
She
is
not
the
right
"pick,"
but
she
was
my
number
one
draft
pick.
They
asked
me
that.
Why
do
you
think?
I
"said,"
"\"I'm"
very
"happy.\""
They
thought
I
was
happy.
They
thought
I
was
happy
for
him.
"No,"
I
was
happy
for
me.
The
Biden-Harris
plan
is
a
step
by
step
recipe
for
abolishing
America's
borders.
In
the
"Biden,"
Bernie
"manifesto,"
Joe
"Biden,"
promises
to
restore
and
expand
catch
and
release
across
the
entire
US
border.
You
believe
that?
We
just
got
rid
of
it.
Free
all
illegal
aliens
from
federal
detention
and
close
detention
"facilities,"
this
would
make
removing
illegal
aliens
totally
"impossible,"
and
you
would
have
"murderers,"
"killers,"
rapists
in
your
midst.
I
don't
think
so.
Immediately
suspend
all
"removals,"
triggering
a
tidal
wave
"of,"
really
a
"flood,"
if
you
"think,"
a
flood
all
across
our
border.
End
prosecution
of
illegal
border
crosses
ensuring
that
illegal
aliens
will
repeatedly
reenter
the
country
over
and
over
again
and
terminate
all
protections
we
have
enacted
against
asylum
fraud.
They
want
to
do
things
that
nobody
thought
was
even
possible
to
contemplate.
"Now,"
this
is
all
simple
and
I
really
respect
because
so
far
I've
only
seen
about
four
or
five
people
go
down.
Because
it
is
hot
in
here.
But
I
will
tell
you
this…
It's
120.
You
know
what
I
said
before?
Think
of
yourself
at
a
great
"spa,"
great
"sauna,"
where
it's
120
degrees
and
we
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
be
there.
You
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money.
Getting
off
the
"border,"
getting
off
illegal
"protection,"
all
of
"that,"
we
are
going
to
lower
your
taxes
further.
We
gave
you
the
biggest
tax
decrease
in
the
history
of…
The
biggest
tax
decrease
in
the
history
of
our
country.
We
decreased
your
taxes
more
than
anybody
has
ever
done
and
we're
doing
more
because
that's
going
to
spell
growth
and
that's
what
happened.
Companies
are
moving
in
like
nobody
has
seen
before.
So
we're
doing
that.
Massive
additional
regulation
cuts.
We've
cut
regulations
more
than
any
president
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
whether
it's
four
"years,"
eight
"years,"
or
in
one
"case,"
more.
I
told
you
"already,"
our
military
is
the
best
it's
ever
been.
It's
got
$2.5
trillion
worth
of
"new,"
beautiful
jets
and
equipment
and
rockets
and
everything.
"Hopefully,"
we
never
have
to
use
it.
Our
nuclear
"arsenal,"
and
"hopefully,"
hopefully
we
never
have
to
even
look
at
"it,"
our
nuclear
arsenal
is
at
a
level
that
it's
never
ever
been
"before,"
and
we
have
to
have
it
"there,"
but
we
never
want
to
use
it.
So
we
have
done
things
not
only
on
the
"border,"
the
border
is
one
"element,"
and
to
me
it's
very
important.
Something
that
they
always
say
about
a
"president,"
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
do
is
the
appointment
of
federal
judges
and
supreme
court
justices.
So
by
the
end
of
"our,"
of
not
"my,"
our
first
"term,"
we
will
have
appointed
300
federal
judges
and
appeals
court
"judges,"
and
two
supreme
court
justices.
When
it
comes
to
2nd
"Amendment,"
when
it
comes
to
"life,"
when
it
comes
to
a
lot
of
things
that
you
people
live
"for,"
if
you
don't
have
the
supreme
court
and
if
you
don't
have
the
courts
in
your
"side,"
you
can
forget
it.
The
next
"president,"
I
"think,"
will
pick
"two,"
"three,"
or
even
four
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
They
can
be
on
the
court
for
40
to
50
years.
You
pick
them
young.
They
could
be
on
there
for
40
to
50
years.
This
is
going
to
be
the
most
consequential
presidency.
This
is
going
to
be
the
most
"important,"
and
I
never
thought
I'd
say
it
because
of
what
happened
four
years
"ago,"
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
important
election
of
your
life.
So
I
just
want
to…
Thank
you.
I
just
want
to
say
stay
"healthy,"
stay
"sharp,"
be
careful.
Be
very
careful.
Go
out
and
work
like
hell.
We
need
every
single
vote
that
we
can
get
because
it's
probably
going
to
be
close.
I
always
assume
it's
going
to
be
close.
They
have
these
"suppression,"
the
fakers
back
"there,"
they
have
the
suppression
polls
where
they
interview
many
more
Democrats
than
they
do
Republicans.
Doug
and
I
were
talking
about
it
and
they
take
out
registered
voters.
It's
not
registered.
They
"say,"
"\"Most"
likely
to
vote
"voters.\""
That's
"what,"
most
likely
"registered,"
they're
"dead,"
they're
"old,"
they're
not
going
to
"go,"
they're
not
going
to
do
anything.
Be
careful
with
your
"ballots,"
but
get
out
there.
November
3rd
is
the
biggest
"date,"
one
of
the
biggest
dates
in
your
"life,"
in
many
"cases,"
"frankly,"
it's
the
most
important
date
of
your
life.
One
other
thing
we've
done
lot.
We've
gotten
rid
of
a
lot
of
nonsense
from
"Obama,"
like
the
Paris
Accord
that
costs
us
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
and
gave
us
nothing.
We've
gotten
rid
of
so
many
different
things
that
you
have
no
"idea,"
but
you
know
what?
If
we
don't
"win,"
they
can
put
it
"back,"
and
with
the
things
that
we
did
put
"in,"
which
are
"many,"
"many,"
many
"things,"
many
"things,"
our
"military,"
our
"vets,"
"everything,"
with
all
of
the
things
that
we
put
"in,"
it's
like
a
"tree,"
it
takes
a
little
while
to
grab
on.
You
transplant
it.
It's
got
to
grab
on.
If
we
have
four
more
"years,"
there's
nothing
that
they
can
do.
Our
country
is
sailing.
our
country
is
sailing.
So
"Yuma,"
thank
you
very
much.
"Arizona,"
thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
for
all
your
support.
We
love
you.
We
will
never
ever
let
you
down.
We
will
never
let
you
down.
"Governor,"
thank
you.
"Martha,"
go
out
and
win.
Go
out
and
win.
Vote
McSally.
Thank
you
everybody.]
"[Hello,"
Houston.
I
am
so
thrilled
to
be
here
in
the
great
state
of
Texas
with
one
of
America's
"greatest,"
most
devoted
and
most
loyal
"friends,"
Prime
Minister
Modi
of
India.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
And
Prime
Minister
Modi
is
doing
a
truly
exceptional
job
for
India
and
for
all
of
the
Indian
people.
It
is
my
immense
privilege
to
be
here
with
him
today
at
this
profoundly
historic
event.
We're
especially
grateful
to
be
joined
by
over
"50,000"
incredible
members
of
our
nation's
"thriving,"
"prospering,"
"flourishing,"
and
hardworking
Indian
American
community.
Thank
you.
Just
a
few
months
ago
in
the
largest
democratic
election
in
the
history
of
our
"world,"
600
million
Indians
went
to
the
polls
and
voted
overwhelmingly
for
Prime
Minister
Modi
and
his
party.
"Congratulations,"
Mr.
Prime
Minister.
That's
a
lot
of
people.
Earlier
this
"week,"
I
understand
you
marked
another
important
milestone.
I
know
everyone
here
joins
me
in
wishing
you
a
very
happy
birthday.
Happy
birthday.
I
want
to
take
a
moment
to
address
every
resident
of
Houston
effected
by
the
recent
horrible
flooding.
The
entire
American
nation
is
standing
by
your
side.
We're
ready.
We
love
you.
We
support
you.
We
will
be
there
with
you
every
single
step
of
the
way.
I
just
left
the
Coast
Guard
hanger
at
Ellington
Field
Joint
Reserve
Base
where
I
was
briefed
on
the
Texas
flooding.
We're
working
with
your
great
governor
Greg
"Abbott,"
Lieutenant
Governor
Dan
"Patrick,"
Attorney
General
Ken
Paxton
and
senators
John
Cornyn
and
Ted
Cruz.
Thank
you
very
much.
We're
working
hard
together.
My
administration
will
not
rest
until
you
have
fully
"recovered,"
"restored,"
and
rebuilt
and
I
know
you
will
come
back
with
the
same
tremendous
spirit
that
we
have
shown
every
single
"time,"
every
time
there's
been
a
problem.
It's
called
"\"Houston"
"strong.\""
Prime
Minister
Modi
and
I
have
come
to
Houston
to
celebrate
everything
that
unites
America
and
"India,"
our
shared
dreams
and
bright
futures.
I've
also
come
to
express
my
profound
gratitude
to
the
nearly
4
million
amazing
Indian
Americans
all
across
our
country.
You
enrich
our
"culture,"
you
uphold
our
"values,"
you
uplift
our
communities
and
you
are
truly
proud
to
be
American
and
we
are
proud
to
have
you
as
Americans.
We
thank
"you,"
we
love
you
and
I
want
you
to
know
my
administration
is
fighting
for
you
each
and
every
day.
I
want
to
recognize
US
Ambassador
to
India
Kenneth
Juster
and
Minister
Jaishankar
of
India.
Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
both.
Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you.
We're
also
proudly
joined
by
NASA
Deputy
Administrator
Jim
"Morhard,"
Deputy
Secretary
Of
Energy
Dan
"Brouillette,"
Governor
Matt
Bevin
of
"Kentucky,"
your
state
attorney
"general,"
Ken
"Paxton,"
a
couple
of
very
great
senators.
"Kevin,"
thank
you.
Thank
you
all
for
being
here.
Thank
"you,"
Kevin.
Thank
you.
We
have
a
lot
of
senators.
We
have
a
lot
of
Congress
people.
There's
Mr.
"Brady,"
Congressman
Brady.
He
gave
us
a
"very,"
very
nice
tax
cut
folks.
Thank
"you,"
"Kevin,"
very
much.
Thank
you
all
for
being
here.
Among
the
leaders
here
today
for
this
remarkable
celebration
are
many
members
of
the
House
and
Senate.
They're
all
over
the
"audience,"
including
House
majority
"leader,"
Steny
"Hoyer,"
and
"again,"
senators
"Cornyn,"
Cruz.
In
my
campaign
for
"president,"
I
promised
all
of
that.
If
we
were
"elected,"
India
would
have
a
true
and
great
friend
in
the
White
House
and
I
can
tell
"you,"
you
have
never
had
a
better
friend
as
president
that
President
Donald
Trump.
That
I
can
tell
you.
The
prime
minister
knows
that.
On
this
"day,"
I'm
happy
to
report
that
the
relationship
between
the
United
States
and
India
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
The
ties
between
our
two
nations
are
grounded
in
our
common
values
and
our
shared
commitment
to
democracy.
We
are
free
nations
with
great
faith
and
a
fierce
devotion
to
our
national
independence.
We
are
governed
by
the
rule
of
"law,"
guided
by
commitment
to
"justice,"
and
strengthened
by
our
love
of
liberty.
Our
two
national
constitutions
both
begin
with
the
same
three
beautiful
"words,"
"\"We"
the
"People.\""
That
means
that
in
America
AMD
India
"alike,"
we
"honor,"
"respect,"
"trust,"
empower
and
fight
for
the
citizens
we
proudly
serve.
Under
Prime
Minister
Modi's
"leadership,"
the
world
is
witnessing
a
strong
sovereign
and
thriving
Republic
of
India.
In
a
single
"decade,"
with
the
help
of
Prime
Minister
Modi's
pro-growth
"reforms,"
India
has
lifted
nearly
300
million
people
out
of
poverty
and
that
is
an
incredible
number.
Incredible.
That's
incredible.
In
the
next
"decade,"
140
million
Indian
households
will
rise
to
the
middle
class.
In
both
India
and
the
United
"States,"
we're
seeing
something
really
remarkable.
Our
people
are
prospering
like
never
before
because
we
are
slashing
bureaucracy
and
cutting
job
killing
red
tape.
In
the
United
"States,"
thanks
to
our
massive
tax
cuts
and
all
of
our
great
senators
and
congressmen
and
women
that
are
here
today
and
pro
worker
"policies,"
our
economy
is
breaking
one
record
after
another.
Since
my
"election,"
we
have
created
over
6
million
new
jobs.
We
have
created
over
"750,000"
jobs
right
here
in
Texas
and
very
"importantly,"
that
includes
"70,000"
new
Texas
manufacturing
jobs.
They
said
that
couldn't
be
done.
Unemployment
…
Think
of
this.
Unemployment
in
Texas
is
currently
at
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
and
unemployment
in
the
United
States
has
just
reached
the
lowest
level
in
over
51
years
and
very
soon
we
think
that
will
be
broken
to
be
a
historic
number.
Unemployment
among
African
"Americans,"
Asian
"Americans,"
and
Hispanic
Americans
have
all
reached
their
lowest
levels
in
the
history
of
our
country.
Over
the
last
two
"years,"
the
unemployment
rate
among
Indian
Americans
dropped
by
nearly
33
and
one
third
percent.
Wages
are
"rising,"
incomes
are
"soaring,"
and
inequality
is
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
in
"many,"
many
years.
In
the
past
12
months
"alone,"
the
average
worker
has
taken
home
"$1,000"
extra
in
rising
wages
and
over
"$3,000"
with
tax
cuts
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
we've
done.
And
for
the
first
time
in
"history,"
most
new
hires
of
prime
working
age
are
minorities
and
women.
First
time
that's
ever
happened.
Through
our
pledge
to
America's
"workers,"
we
have
secured
commitments
for
nearly
14
million
employment
and
training
opportunities
for
American
workers
done
through
our
great
American
companies.
We
passed
the
biggest
tax
cuts
and
the
biggest
tax
reforms
in
the
history
of
our
country.
We
slashed
a
record
number
of
job
killing
"regulations,"
giving
the
average
American
household
more
than
"$3,000"
every
year
and
never
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
no
matter
how
long
the
"presidency,"
have
regulations
been
cut
to
this
extent.
"Everyday,"
the
Indian
American
community
is
helping
to
strengthen
our
country
and
build
our
future.
Indian
Americans
are
pioneering
groundbreaking
medicines
to
save
countless
lives.
They're
developing
revolutionary
technology
that
is
changing
the
world
and
they're
founding
new
businesses
that
provide
jobs
to
thousands
of
our
fellow
citizens.
Prime
Minister
"Modi,"
I
look
forward
to
working
with
you
to
make
our
nations
even
more
prosperous
than
ever
before.
And
that's
what's
happening.
The
economic
miracles
taking
place
today
are
just
beginning.
Here
in
the
United
"States,"
there
has
never
been
a
better
time
to
"hire,"
"invest,"
"grow,"
and
pursue
your
dreams.
Indian
companies
employ
tens
of
thousands
of
Americans
across
a
range
of
"industries,"
including
American
steel.
In
2018
India's
JSW
Steel
announced
that
it
would
invest
up
to
$500
million
to
revitalize
a
shuttered
steel
plant
in
the
great
state
of
Ohio.
And
we
welcome
India's
growing
investments
right
here
in
the
Lone
Star
State.
Nations
around
the
world
are
investing
in
the
United
States
because
they
know
we
have
the
best
economy
and
the
best
workers
in
the
world.
They
have
never
invested
in
our
country
like
they
are
today.
And
we
want
to
thank
everybody
and
India
has
never
invested
in
the
United
States
like
it
is
doing
today.
And
I
want
to
say
it's
reciprocal
because
we're
doing
the
same
thing
in
India.
On
"Tuesday,"
two
Japanese
"companies,"
Toyota
and
"Aisin,"
announced
a
combined
investment
of
almost
$800
"million,"
which
will
create
over
900
new
jobs
right
here
in
Texas.
At
the
same
"time,"
we
are
working
to
expand
American
exports
to
"India,"
one
of
the
world's
fastest
growing
markets.
We
are
committed
to
ensuring
the
Indian
people
have
access
to
the
finest
goods
in
the
"world,"
product
stamped
with
a
beautiful
"phrase,"
"\"Made"
in
the
"USA.\""
And
very
"soon,"
India
will
have
access
to
another
world
class
American
"product,"
NBA
basketball.
"Wow,"
sounds
good.
That
sounds
good.
Next
week
thousands
of
people
will
gather
in
Mumbai
to
watch
the
first
ever
NBA
basketball
game
in
India.
Am
I
"invited,"
Mr.
Prime
Minister?
I
may
come.
Be
careful.
I
may
come.
When
it
comes
to
expanding
our
commercial
"relationship,"
no
issue
is
more
important
than
energy
security.
For
the
first
time
"ever,"
the
United
States
is
the
number
one
producer
of
both
oil
and
natural
gas
on
planet
earth
and
number
one
by
"far,"
with
much
of
it
coming
right
here
from
the
great
state
of
Texas.
That
means
more
"jobs,"
higher
"wages,"
and
lower
prices
at
the
pump.
"Yesterday,"
we
were
thrilled
to
hear
about
the
Indian
company
Petronas
pledge
to
purchase
up
to
5
million
tons
of
LNG
per
year
from
the
United
"States,"
which
could
lead
to
billions
of
dollars
of
LNG
exports
to
India
in
the
coming
years.
And
we
have
plenty
of
it.
Over
the
last
"year,"
crude
exports
to
India
have
grown
by
400%
and
liquefied
natural
gas
exports
continue
to
soar
at
record
numbers.
Thank
you.
These
tremendous
exports
not
only
expand
employment
in
"America,"
but
they
increase
freedom
and
security
for
India.
To
keep
our
nation
"safe,"
the
United
States
and
India
forging
an
even
stronger
security
partnership.
US
defense
sales
to
India
have
also
reached
$18
billion
over
the
past
decade.
We
make
the
greatest
defense
mechanisms
and
equipment
anywhere
in
the
world
and
India
knows
that
well.
We're
looking
forward
to
concluding
several
new
defense
deals
very
soon.
There
are
a
lot
of
them
in
the
works.
Here
in
"America,"
we're
creating
the
United
States
Space
Force
and
we're
working
closely
with
India
to
enhance
space
cooperation.
In
"November,"
the
United
States
and
India
will
demonstrate
a
dramatic
progress
of
our
defense
"relationship,"
holding
the
first
ever
tri-service
military
exercise
between
our
nations.
It's
called
Tiger
Triumph.
Good
"name,"
it's
a
good
name.
Very
good
name.
"Today,"
we
honor
all
of
the
brave
American
and
Indian
military
service
members
who
work
together
to
safeguard
our
freedom.
We
stand
proudly
in
defense
of
liberty
and
we
are
committed
to
protecting
innocent
civilians
from
the
threat
of
radical
Islamic
terrorism.
Thank
you.
Both
India
and
the
United
States
also
understand
that
to
keep
our
communities
"safe,"
we
must
protect
our
borders.
Since
taking
"office,"
my
administration
has
launched
a
far-reaching
effort
to
improve
screening
and
vetting
of
applications
for
entry.
We
are
working
hard
to
ensure
that
those
who
would
threaten
our
security
are
denied
admission
into
our
country
and
we
are
enhancing
our
vetting
efforts
like-
…
"country,"
and
we
are
enhancing
our
vetting
efforts
like
never
"before,"
not
even
close.
We're
doing
it
on
a
daily
"basis,"
and
we'll
soon
be
setting
records
in
every
one
of
the
aspects
of
border
security.
Border
security
is
vital
to
the
United
States.
Border
security
is
vital
to
India.
We
understand
that.
We
are
further
taking
unprecedented
action
to
finally
secure
our
southern
border
and
stop
illegal
immigration.
I
want
to
thank
the
president
of
"Mexico,"
who
right
now
has
"27,000"
soldiers
on
our
southern
border.
It's
been
incredible
what's
taken
place
in
a
short
period
of
time.
Illegal
immigration
is
deeply
unfair
to
millions
of
wonderful
legal
immigrants
who
work
"hard,"
pay
their
"taxes,"
follow
our
"rules,"
and
obey
our
laws.
Yet
there
are
those
in
Washington
who
would
raid
your
healthcare
to
…
Free
benefits.
They
want
to
fund
free
benefits
to
those
who
enter
our
country
illegally.
We
don't
want
to
do
that.
We
don't
want
to
do
that.
Because
if
we
don't
do
"it,"
they
won't
come.
I
will
never
allow
politicians
to
take
away
your
healthcare
or
give
it
to
illegal
immigrants.
My
administration
believes
our
first
duty
is
to
the
highest
loyalty
of
all.
We
must
always
be
for
the
American
"people,"
whether
it's
"African-American,"
"Hispanic-American,"
Indian-American.
We
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
citizens
first.
We
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
Indian-American
citizens
before
we
take
care
of
illegal
immigrants
that
want
to
pour
into
our
country.
We
want
to
build
a
nation
where
every
"family,"
immigrant
and
"US-born,"
can
live
in
a
safe
community
with
access
to
great
"school,"
work
in
a
job
you
"love,"
and
have
the
best
chance
to
reach
the
American
dream.
We
love
the
American
dream.
Just
in
"concluding,"
I
want
to
say
that
America
has
always
been
a
nation
of
pioneers
and
"patriots,"
risk-takers
and
free
"thinkers,"
and
dedicated
workers
who
have
honed
a
"trade,"
mastered
their
"field,"
and
teach
their
children
to
always
give
their
"very,"
very
best.
Every
day
Indian-Americans
help
write
the
story
of
American
"greatness,"
and
everyone
here
today
has
a
crucial
part
to
play
in
building
an
even
grander
and
greater
American
and
Indian
future.
To
help
achieve
that
exciting
"vision,"
we
are
strengthening
our
cherished
bonds
with
the
nation
of
"India,"
and
we
are
proving
the
awesome
power
of
democracy
and
unlimited
potential
of
free
people.
"Together,"
we
will
continue
to
deepen
the
ties
between
our
nations.
We
will
honor
the
faith
of
dignity
of
our
"citizens,"
and
we
will
achieve
incredible
advancements
for
our
"people,"
for
our
"children,"
and
for
the
world.
We
will
discover
new
cures
and
save
millions
of
lives.
We
will
advance
cutting-edge
technologies
and
lift
millions
and
millions
of
people
out
of
poverty.
We
will
pioneer
new
frontiers
in
"space,"
working
"together,"
raising
the
sights
of
humanity.
We
will
uphold
our
"values,"
defend
our
"liberty,"
and
control
our
destiny.
The
United
States
and
India
will
make
our
nations
"stronger,"
our
people
"wealthier,"
our
dreamers
"bigger,"
and
our
future
brighter
than
ever
"before,"
and
it
won't
even
be
close.
I
want
to
thank
everybody
for
being
here.
I
want
to
especially
thank
a
great
man
and
a
great
"leader,"
the
leader
of
"India,"
Prime
Minister
"Modi,"
my
friend.
Thank
you.
God
bless
you
all.
God
bless
"India,"
and
God
bless
America.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Now
I
would
like
to
invite
onto
this
stage
in
front
of
this
incredible
group
of
unbelievable
people
Prime
Minister
"Modi,"
who's
going
to
give
us
some
of
his
wisdom.
His
wisdom
is
indeed
great.
Thank
you
all
very
much.
It's
been
a
great
honor
to
be
with
you.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.]

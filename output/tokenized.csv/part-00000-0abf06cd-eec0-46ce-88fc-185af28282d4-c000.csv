[thank
you.
thank

thank
you
to
vice
president
pence.
he's
a
good
guy.
we've
done
a
great
job
together.
and
merry
"christmas,"
michigan.
thank
"you,"
michigan.
what
a
victory
we
had
in
michigan.
what
a
victory
was
that.
one
of
the
greats.
was
that
the
greatest
evening?
but
i'm
thrilled
to
be
here
with
thousands
of
hardworking
patriots
as
we
celebrate
the
miracle
of
"christmas,"
the
greatness
of
america
and
the
glory
of
god.
thank
you
very
much.
and
did
you
notice
that
everybody
is
saying
merry
christmas
again?
did
you
notice?
saying
merry
christmas.
i
remember
when
i
first
started
this
beautiful
"trip,"
this
beautiful
"journey,"
i
just
said
to
the
first
"lady,"
"\"you"
are
so
lucky.
i
took
you
on
this
fantastic
journey.
it's
so
much
fun.
they
want
to
impeach
you.
they
want
to
do
worse
than
"that.\""
by
the
"way,"
by
the
"way,"
by
the
"way,"
it
doesn't
really
feel
like
we're
being
impeached.
the
country
is
doing
better
than
ever
before.
we
did
nothing
wrong.
we
did
nothing
wrong.
and
we
have
tremendous
support
in
the
republican
party
like
we've
never
had
before.
nobody's
ever
had
this
kind
of
support.
but
this
sacred
"season,"
our
country
is
thriving
and
it's
thriving
truly
like
it
has
"never,"
it
has
never
happened
before
to
the
extent
what's
happening
now.
and
by
the
"way,"
your
"state,"
because
of
"us,"
not
because
of
local
"government,"
but
because
of
"us,"
because
of
the
job
that
we've
done.
because
i
understand
she's
not
fixing
those
potholes.
that's
what
the
word
is.
it
was
all
about
roads
and
they
want
to
raise
those
gasoline
taxes
on
you.
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
but
she's
not
fixing
the
potholes.
but
michigan's
had
the
best
year
it's
ever
had.
best
year
it's
ever
had.
and
that's
because
we
have
auto
companies
expanding
and
thriving
and
they're
coming
in
from
japan
and
they're
coming
in
from
a
lot
of
other
places.
look
what's
happening.
and
you
"know,"
i
don't
know
if
you
know
"this,"
but
probably
10
years
ago
i
was
honored.
i
was
the
man
of
the
year
by
i
think
"somebody,"
whoever.
i
was
the
man
of
the
year
in
michigan.
can
you
believe
it?
long
time.
and
that
was
long
before
i
ever
decided
to
do
this.
i
was
happy.
i
had
a
beautiful
life.
what
the
hell
did
i
do
this
for?
but
look
how
we're
doing.
do
we
love
it?
i
love
it.
but
"anyway,"
i
was
the
man
of
the
year
and
probably
close
to
10
years
ago
and
i
came
to
michigan.
he
"said,"
"\"you're"
still
the
man
of
the
"year.\""
thank
you.
who
said
that?
thank
you.
so
i
came
in
and
i
remember
the
speech
so
well.
i
"said,"
"\"why"
are
you
allowing
them
to
steal
your
car
companies?
why
are
you
allowing
them
to
go
to
mexico
and
to
go
from
china
where
they
come
in
from
"china,"
they
build
them
in
"china,"
they
sell
them
into
our
country
with
no
tax
and
you
lose
your
"jobs,"
you
lose
your
"factories,"
the
companies
leave
and
you
get
nothing.
why
are
they
"lying?\""
i
asked
that
a
long
time
ago
and
we
stopped
it.
we've
stopped
it.
and
you
see
that.
and
we
just
made
the
usmca.
we're
getting
rid
of
"nafta,"
which
i
think
is
the
worst
trade
deal
ever.
and
it's
very
exciting.
it's
a
great
deal.
it's
a
great
deal.
it's
going
to
stop
exactly
what
we
were
just
talking
about.
it
makes
it
"very,"
very
prohibitive.
they
can
do
"it,"
but
they've
got
to
pay
a
hell
of
a
big
price
to
do
it.
and
history
has
proven
that
stops
them.
but
we
have
a
great
usmca
that
we
negotiated
with
"mexico,"
with
canada.
"now,"
from
the
standpoint
of
the
"farmers,"
you
know
what's
going
on.
we
had
tremendous
trade
barriers
in
canada.
we
had
attacks
on
dairy
"products,"
297%
"tariff,"
nobody
talked
about
"it,"
with
canada.
and
we
had
some
really
bad
things
with
mexico.
we
now
have
a
wonderful
deal.
and
if
we
didn't
have
a
good
"deal,"
you
know
what
i
would
have
done
what?
what?
i
would
have
put
tariffs
on
both
countries
and
that
would
have
been
"it,"
right?
that
would
have
been
it.
unfortunately
the
deal's
been
sitting
with
nancy
pelosi
for
a
long
time
and
what
happened?
and
she
had
a
lot
of
"pressure,"
especially
from
manufacturing
"areas,"
farm
"areas,"
a
lot
of
pressure
to
sign
it.
so
here's
what
happens.
so
i
get
along
with
labor.
i
had
a
lot
of
union
labor
vote
for
"me,"
tremendous
amount
of
labor.
in
new
york
where
i
come
"from,"
we
have
a
lot
of
unions.
and
that's
okay.
that's
fine.
so
we
left
a
little
stuff
for
the
union
because
we
figured
to
get
it
"signed,"
we'll
give
a
little
bit
and
we
did
it
and
we
have
one
great
deal.
and
now
you
have
the
democrats
trying
to
take
credit
for
this
deal
and
that's
okay.
whatever
it
takes.
for
seven
"months,"
it
sits.
they
don't
do
anything.
we
give.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
spoke
to
the
unions
the
day
before
i
"say,"
"\"fellows,"
you
got
to
get
it
"done.\""
and
union
labor
loves
me
and
i
love
you
too
sir.
i
love
you
too
sir.
so
we
have
a
great
deal
with
"mexico,"
with
canada.
and
it
is
true.
i
say
it
out
loud
because
i
say
it
to
them
right
now.
if
they
ever
wanted
to
break
the
"deal,"
that's
okay.
if
somebody
wants
to
break
a
deal
with
"me,"
you
always
have
to
have
an
"alternative,"
right?
and
this
"country,"
the
deals
we
"made,"
we
did
a
deal
with
south
korea.
that's
great.
we
did
a
deal
with
"japan,"
40
billion
dollar
deal
with
japan.
it
was
just
a
little
piece
of
a
deal.
okay?
that
was
a
piece
of
a
deal.
and
i
said
to
"japan,"
"\"look,"
you
got
to
make
this
deal
or
we're
going
to
put
a
20%
tariff
on
the
cars.
and
that's
more
money
than
anything
we're
talking
"about.\""
that's
all
right.
that's
all
right.
that's
all
right.
get
her
out.
ger
her
out
of
here.
oh
well.
you're
about
to
hear
the
greatest
speech
you've
ever
heard.
and
that's
going
to
be
the
publicity
because
all
the
fake
news
back
there
will
say
massive
riot…
massive
riots.
fake
news.
but
"seriously,"
"look,"
"look,"
"look,"
they
won't
say
it.
they
won't
say
"it,"
because
when
we
have
protesters
all
in
"favor,"
they
don't
talk
about
"it,"
but
there's
a
slob.
there's
a
real
slob.
"wait,"
wait
a
minute.
she'll
get
hell
when
she
gets
back
home
with
mom.
but
she
made…
"look,"
she
screams
a
little
bit.
and
you
know
what
i
like
to
do?
avoid
them.
because
i'll
tell
you
the
big
problem.
i
could
hardly
hear
her.
what
happens
is
all
of
you
people
go
crazy.
"look,"
"look,"
"look,"
and
the
place.
"okay,"
so
there's
one
disgusting
person
who
made…
"wait,"
"wait,"
who
made
a…
i
wouldn't
say
"this,"
but
made
a
horrible
gesture
with
the
wrong
finger
right?
now
they
won't
say
"that,"
the
fake
"news,"
they
won't
say
it.
if
one
of
us
did
"that,"
it
would
be
like
the
biggest
story
ever.
i
think
it's
terrible.
and
i'll
tell
you
the
other
"thing,"
i
don't
know
who
the
security
company
"is,"
but
the
police
came
"up,"
but
they
want
to
be
so
politically
correct
so
they
don't
grab
her
wrist
lightly
and
get
her
out.
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
would
you
please
come?
would
you
please
come
with
"me?\""
sure.
"\"ma'am,"
would
"you?\""
and
then
she
gives
the
guy
the
finger
and
"he,"
"\"oh,"
"oh.\""
you
got
to
get
a
little
bit
stronger
than
"that,"
folks.
and
they…
.
making
another
group
of
"tariffs,"
seven
and
a
half
percent.
this
gives
us
a
lot
of
currency
to
do
the
phase
two
"deal,"
which
they
want
to
"start,"
but
we're
taking
in
billions
of
dollars
and
to
help
the
farmers
who
were
"targeted,"
16
billion
and
12
billion
the
previous
"year,"
helps
the
farmers.
so
you
know
what
we
"do,"
out
of
that
big
check
that
we
"get,"
all
that
money
flows
into
the
treasury.
out
of
the
big
"check,"
we
gave
the
farmers
16
billion
dollars
and
12
billion
for
the
previous
year.
and
you
"know,"
the
incredible
"thing,"
and
i
was
with
a
lot
of
farmers.
i
was
with
a
group
of
36
farmers
at
the
white
house.
you
know
what
they
said
to
me?
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
it.
we're
going
to
take
care
of
you
"guys.\""
and
i
used
a
bad
word.
you
know
what
word
i
used?
we're
going
to
get
you
a
subsidy.
and
they
said
this
two
years
"ago,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
were
you
targeted
"for?\""
this
was
the
first
year.
"\"12"
"billion,"
"sir.\""
the
second
year
was
16.
they
were
target.
that's
what
they
didn't
get
from
china.
so
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
all
"right,"
we're
going
to
give
you
a
subsidy
of
the
same
and
we're
going
to
take
it
out
of
the
tariffs
and
we're
going
to
have
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
left
"over.\""
and
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
don't
want
money.
we
just
want
a
level
playing
"field.\""
i've
never
seen
that
before.
i've
never
seen
that
before.
so
we
will
have
invested
in
our
"military,"
since
i'm
"here,"
which
is
less
than
three
years.
our
"military,"
by
the
"way,"
in
all
due
respect
to
the
previous
two
"administrations,"
our
military
was
depleted.
it
was
depleted.
it
was
in
bad
shape.
we
had
fighter
jets
that
were
35
years
old.
we
had
planes
that
were
60
years…
you
heard
where
the
father
flew
"them,"
the
grandfather
flew
"them,"
and
now
the
young
son
comes
in.
we've
got
the
best
equipment
in
the
world
now.
spent
two
and
a
half
trillion
"dollars,"
made
in
the
usa.
two
and
a
half
trillion.
we
will
shortly.
that'll
be
all
finished.
we're
going
to
have
the
greatest…
now
we
have
the
best
planes.
we're
going
to
have
the
best
ships.
we're
building
a
lot
of
ships
now.
we're
building
the
most
powerful
weapons
in
the
world.
"now,"
we
don't
want
to
even
talk
about
it.
we
never
want
to
use
them.
but
you
"know,"
the
way
we're
not
going
to
have
to
use
them
is
if
we
have
them.
we're
building
"submarines,"
the
power
of
which
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
it's
"funny,"
we
have
these
companies
come
in.
i
like
to
make
good
deals.
you
like
to
make
good
deals.
that's
what
we
"do,"
right?
so
these
really
countries
that
come
"in,"
prime
"ministers,"
"presidents,"
sometimes
"dictators,"
those
we
can't
deal
with
too
much.
"\"sir,"
we'd
like
to
buy
a
nuclear
"submarine.\""
i
"say,"
"\"no"
"thanks.\""
i
turn
them
all
down.
you
have
no
idea
how
many
people…
but
we're
building
some
of
the…
they're
the
most
powerful
weapons
ever
made
by
man
or
womankind.
i
say
mankind
and
womankind.
they
can
definitely
fight.
they're
the
real
deal.
these
"guys,"
so
good
looking.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
could
be
a
movie
star.
go
to
"hollywood.\""
"\"no"
sir.
i
like
doing
what
i'm
"doing.\""
so
i
said
to
these
"guys,"
you
going
to
"see,"
just
like
central
"casting,"
i
"said,"
i
"said,"
"\"fellas,"
how
good
is
this
"plane?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
it's
"great.\""
"\"why?\""
"\"because"
the
enemy
can't
see
"it.\""
that
helps.
stealth.
it's
actually
called
super
stealth.
so
i
"said,"
"\"you"
mean
they
can't
"see,"
so
you
shoot
at
them
but
they
"can't…\""
he
"said,"
"\"they"
have
no
idea
where
we
"are,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that"
sounds
good
to
"me.\""
nobody
does
it.
nobody
can
do
it.
we
have
the
whole
thing
and
we
bought
in
a
lot
of
those
"planes,"
we
bought
in
a
lot
of
great
stuff.
and
i
won't
tell
you
the
"story,"
but
very
early
on
i
thought
we
were
going
to
have
a
problem
"someplace,"
and
one
of
the
generals
came
up
to
me
and
"said,"
"\"sir,"
don't
go.
don't
do
"it.\""
"\"why?\""
"\"we"
don't
have
the
"ammunition.\""
and
i
said
two
things.
i
never
want
to
hear
a
president.
right?
we
never
want
to
have
a
president
hear
that
"again,"
nor
do
we
want
a
president
to
have
to
go
through
the
crap
that
we
were
going
through
back
then.
"but,"
another
thing
we
"did,"
which
to
me
is
such
an
incredible
thing
to
have
done.
it's
such
an
honor.
so
our
last
us
armed
"forces,"
the
last
branch
was
the
air
"force,"
right?
that
was
"many,"
many
decades
ago.
we
are
now
building
and
we
have
now
gotten
funding
for
the
sixth
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
"forces,"
the
space
force.
so
i'll
be
able
to
tell
my
kids
someday
and
everybody
"else,"
"\"see"
that
space
force?
that
was
my
"baby.\""
and
you
think
that
was
easy?
that's
not
easy.
because
you
have
democrats
that
do
not
like
our
military.
they
do
not
like
our
military.
and
we
did
something
"yesterday,"
because
for
three
years
i
would
see
people
that
run…
incredible
"people,"
the
heads
of
the
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
in
the
country.
and
every
year
they'd
come
in
and
they'd
be
looking
for
help.
they
needed
help
and
they
do
need
help
with
it
and
it's
great
and
they
do
an
incredible
job.
so
many
great
"schools,"
but
they
need
help.
and
every
year
they'd
have
to
come
and
come.
i
got
to
know
them
actually.
i
"said,"
"\"the"
only
bad
thing
is
you
won't
see
me
too
much
"anymore.\""
because
we
just
provided
record
funding
for
a
nation's
historically
black
colleges
and
universities.
and
it's
"longterm,"
they're
not
going
to
have
to
come.
so
i
"said,"
"\"look,"
we
could
do
it
where
we
do
it
every
year
or
we'll
do
what
we
have.
what
do
you
"want?\""
they
"said,"
"\"let"
us
just
have
"it.\""
so
we'll
miss
them.
but
they
are
great
people.
they've
done
an
incredible
job.
and
our
extraordinary
jobs
"boom,"
which
created
another
"266,000"
jobs
last
"month,"
and
then
you
add
the
undercount
from
the
previous
two
"months,"
you're
close
to
"300,000"
jobs.
and
they
"said,"
if
you're
a
business
watcher
which
i
"am,"
i
love
watching
"business,"
but
they
said
they
were
"guessing,"
could
be
"70,000,"
could
be
"80,000,"
maybe
"90,"
maybe
"110,"
somebody
said.
then
the
number
comes
"out,"
"266,000"
with
an
adjustment.
remember
about
four
months
ago
when
we
had
one
little
"period,"
right?
we
had
one
little
period
where
there
was
a
little
downturn.
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
"oh,"
we
think
we're
going
into
a
"recession.\""
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
"it.\""
"\"we"
think
we're
going
into
a
"recession.\""
they
were
willing
to
lose
their
wealth.
they
were
willing
for
this
stocks
and
whatever
the
hell
they
"own,"
what
do
you
guys
own
back
there?
let
it
go.
they'll
go
bust.
they
don't
care.
anything
to
get
rid
of
us.
not
"me,"
us.
and
you
know
what?
then
all
of
a
"sudden,"
and
now
for
the
last
couple
of
"weeks,"
we've
set
brand
new
records
in
the
history
of
the
various
stock
markets.
"so,"
as
of
"yesterday,"
we've
had
133
record
days
in
the
stock
market
"now,"
and
that's
in
less
than
three
years.
so
when
i
see
that
i
don't
care
because
i
don't…
i'm
not
allowed
to
have
stock.
i
can't
have
stock.
they
consider
it
a
conflict
of
interest
and
that
i
can
understand.
i
agree.
i
can.
but
you
know
what?
i'll
tell
you
what.
what
i
"see,"
i
see
tremendous
job
growth
because
we're
setting
records.
but
you
know
what
i
also
see?
the
401ks
where
people
are
up
"90%,"
they're
up
"97%,"
they're
up
82%.
i
tell
you
the
story
all
the
time.
i
"mean,"
i
have
people
coming
up
to
"me,"
and
a
man
came
"up,"
a
policeman.
i've
told
this
"story,"
but
i've
had
"many,"
so
many
"times,"
but
this
guy
in
"particular,"
because
it
was
early
and
that
was
a
year
ago.
that
was
a
long
time
ago.
right
now
it's
much
higher
than
that.
but
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
i
want
to
thank
you.
my
wife
thinks
i'm
a
loser.
all
my
"life,"
we
never
did
well
with
the
"401ks,"
with
stocks.
everything
i
"invested,"
i'm
up
"72%,"
sir.
she
thinks
i'm
a
financial
genius.
she's
so
in
love
with
me.
she
so
in
"love.\""
he
"said,"
"\"she"
"said,"
"‘darling,"
i
think
you're
one
of
the
greatest
investors.
why
don't
you
do
this
professionally?'
and
i
don't
even
know
what
i'm
"doing,"
sir.
i
just
have
all
these
"stocks.\""
so
i
just
wanted
to
tell
"you,"
i
look
at
a
"401k,"
who
has
401ks
here?
so
that's
what
i
see.
i
don't
care
about
the
rich
ones.
i
care
about
everybody.
i
care.
i
care
about
everybody
actually.
ford
motor
company
just
announced
that
it
is
investing
1.5
billion
dollars
into
auto
factories
in
the
detroit
"area,"
creating
another
3000
michigan
jobs.
and
that's
on
top
of
the
many
other
investments
we've
gotten
from
japanese
"companies,"
car
"companies,"
and
other
companies.
but
they're
all
coming
in
and
a
lot
of
them
are
coming
to
michigan.
and
i
"say,"
"\"hey,"
go
to
"michigan.\""
sometimes
they'll
go
south
and
that's
"okay,"
whatever.
i
want
them
in
this
country.
but
ideally
i
want
to
fill
them
up.
we're
doing
so
well
in
michigan
with
the
auto
companies.
now
you're
back.
you're
back.
"so,"
you're
back.
very
proud
of
you.
very
proud
of
you.
but
while
we're
creating
"jobs,"
fighting
for
michigan
"workers,"
and
achieving
numbers
that
you've
never
seen
"before,"
incredible
victories
for
the
american
people
are
happening.
the
radical
left
in
congress
is
consumed
with
hatred
and
envy
and
rage.
you
see
what's
going
on?
i'll
tell
"you,"
these
people
are
crazy.
you
ever
"hear,"
"\"it's"
the
"economy,"
"stupid.\""
you
know
that
was
clinton's
saying.
if
you
have
a
good
economy.
i
have
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
this
country
and
nobody
talks
about
it.
nobody
talks
about
it.
if
you're
a
"democrat,"
they
"say,"
"\""
"oh,"
it's
the
"economy…\""
if
the
economy's
any
good.
and
let
me
just
tell
you
a
little
secret.
if
crooked
hillary
would've
"won,"
your
economy
would
have
crashed.
you
were
going
down.
the
regulations
were
taking
it
down.
the
taxes
were
taking
it
"down,"
instead
of
being
up
92%
or
whatever
you're
"up,"
a
"lot,"
you
would
have
been
"down,"
you
would
have
been
at
less
than
half.
it
was
crashing.
for
all
those
people
that
would
"say,"
"\"oh,"
it's
the
"obama…\""
let
me
tell
you
something.
you
were
dying.
and
if
you
look
at
that
first
period
of
a
couple
of
"months,"
it
was
a
"disaster,"
but
it
was
heading
south.
and
as
sure
as
you're
"standing,"
and
i'm
sorry
we
couldn't
get
you
"seats,"
we
didn't
have
any
room.
and
by
the
"way,"
"20,000"
people
outside
had
to
leave.
you
know?
it's
so
cold
outside
we
told
"them,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
a
"screen,"
go
"home,"
go
home
and
"watch.\""
but
we
"had,"
this
is
about
a
"5,500"
seat
arena.
and
i
said
to
my
"people,"
"\"why"
so
"small?\""
are
we
spoiled?
i
watch
these
guys
come
in
like
"biden,"
he
has
a
big
rally
and
they
get
93
people
show
up.
"no,"
it's
true.
i
don't
understand
it.
and
did
you
see
the
new
polls
from
usa
today
came
out?
i'm
killing
everybody.
and
they
hate
me.
usa
today
hates
me.
but
there's
a
"poll,"
we're
beating
everybody.
"but,"
so
biden
has
this
"rally,"
they've
got
200
"seats,"
but
only
a
small
number
of
people.
so
you
know
what
they
do?
they
set
up
a
round
table.
so
think
of
these
people.
they
come
"in,"
they
think
they're
going
to
listen
to
the
"speech,"
they
end
up
sitting
on
a
round
table
discussing…
they
must've
been
"happy,"
right?
we
don't
have
enough
room
for
round
tables.
i'm
sorry
folks.
"no,"
they
set
up
a
round
table
but
i
think
we're
doing
great.
and
how
do
you
beat
what
we've
done?
with
the
"economy,"
with
our
great
"vets,"
with
choice.
you've
finally
got
choice.
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
for
almost
50
years.
four
more
years.
four
more
years.
four
more
years.
four
more
years.
four
more
years.
four
more
years.
and
these
people
back
here?
your
seat
or
stand
is
better.
right?
but
you
know
what?
they're
going
to
be
much
more
famous
because
the
cameras
can't
see
you.
they
can
only
see
them.
and
the
other
"thing,"
the
"cameras,"
do
you
ever
"notice,"
i
go
to
these
"stadiums,"
"25,"
"30,000"
people.
they
never
show
the
crowd.
you
know
why?
because
they
don't
want
to
have…
if
crazy
"pocahontas,"
if
crazy
pocahontas
goes
to
the
middle
of
central
park
or
whatever.
she's
in
manhattan.
you
got
me.
and
"people,"
i
"mean,"
i
could
"have,"
i
could
have
baron
trump
go
into
central
park
and
he'd
get
a
crowd
that
would
be
just
as…
he's
13.
he'd
get
a
bigger
crowd.
but
if
she
has
the
"crowd,"
"\"oh,"
these
crowds
are
so
"big.\""
i've
had
crowds
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks.
we
went
to
different
"pennsylvania,"
florida.
but
i
mean
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
can't
get
into
these
nba
"arenas,"
right?
big
arenas.
and
we
set
records
at
everyone
because
we
use
the
floor.
thank
you.
i
appreciate
it.
but
we
use
the
"floor,"
right?
the
basketball
court.
so
we
set
records
at
every
arena.
they
never
even
mention
the
crowds.
they
never
mention
the
crowds.
it's
sort
of
amazing.
you
know
what?
i
don't
think
we've
ever
had
an
empty
seat
from
the
time
i
came
down
the
escalator.
that's
a
long
time
ago.
i
don't
think
we've
ever
had
an
empty
seat.
now
what
the
crooked
media
does
"though,"
if
you
got
like
over
"here,"
look
how
packed
it
is
and
there's
thousands
"outside,"
but
i…
"\"please"
go
home.
you're
going
to
catch
"pneumonia.\""
but
here's
the
thing.
if
this
man
and
that
beautiful
woman
happened
to
get
up
because
they
want
to
go
to
the
"bathroom,"
those
cameras
will
turn
to
those
two
seats
and
they'll
say
"\"trump"
wasn't
able
to
fill
up
the
"arena.\""
i
always
get
nervous
when
i
see
some…
i
know
they're
coming
back.
nobody
ever
leaves
our
speeches.
because
is
there
a
better
place
to
be
in
the
world
than
a
trump
rally?
but
every
time
i
see
a
man
get
"up,"
i
see
a
beautiful
woman
with
a
baby
and
they're
getting
up.
the
baby's
going
crazy
and
they're
getting
up.
they're
going
to
take
it…
but
i
know
they're
going
to
be
right
back.
and
i
"say,"
"\"fill"
those
two
seats.
i
don't
want
them
to
see
"it.\""
because
they'll
"say,"
"\"couldn't"
fill
up
the
"arena.\""
these
are
truly
dishonest
people.
after
three
years
of
sinister
witch
"hunts,"
"hoaxes,"
"scams,"
tonight
the
house
democrats
are
trying
to
nullify
the
ballots
of
tens
of
millions
of
patriotic
americans.
capped
off
with
one
of
the
greatest
election
evenings
in
history.
was
that
the
greatest?
remember
when
they
all
"said,"
remember
when
they
all
"said,"
"\"no,"
no.
you
can't
win
michigan.
you
"can't.\""
then
i
"went,"
i
did
one
in
grand
"rapids,"
right?
grand
rapids.
we
had
"32,000"
people
that
night.
it
was
one
o'clock
in
the
morning.
that
means
it
was
election
day
when
i
started
speaking.
"hillary,"
barack
"obama,"
michelle
"obama,"
and
bill
"clinton,"
they
did
an
emergency
trip.
they
did
an
emergency
trip
to
michigan
at
six
o'clock.
they
got
here
at
prime
time.
they
started
to
speak.
she
had
500
people.
i
got
here
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
next
"day,"
which
is
now
election
day.
how
many
people
were
there?
"32,000"
people
"outside,"
inside.
it
was
the
last
speech
of
michigan.
and
they
"say,"
"\"well,"
"sir,"
it's
very
hard
to
win
"michigan.\""
i
"said,"
"\"why"
would
it
be
"hard?\""
here's
the
beautiful
thing.
everything
i
told
you
i've
"done,"
but
much
more
so.
i
said
i
was
going
to
bring
car
companies
back.
i
said
i
was
going
to
bring
in…
i
just
hope
you
people
know
that.
i
just
hope
you
know
it.
but
i'll
never
forget
that
night.
and
in
all
fairness
to
bill
"clinton,"
he
used
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
until
i
ran
for
office.
i
like
"him,"
i
like
him.
but
he
"told,"
you
know
the
way
they
tried
to
shut
him
"out,"
right?
because
he's
a
pro.
he's
an
instinct
"guy,"
right?
he's
instinct.
he
doesn't
need…
right?
because
he's
a
pro.
he's
an
instinct
"guy,"
right?
he's
instinct.
he
doesn't
need
polling
companies.
who
the
hell
wants
him?
you
"know,"
if
you
want
a
polling
"company,"
pick
up
the
newspaper.
the
problem
is
the
newspaper
polls
are
more
fake
than
the
news
they
write.
they
write
fake
polls.
it's
"true,"
they
write
fake
polls.
you
call
them
suppression
polls.
you
read
them
and
you
get
"depressed,"
because
it
looks
like
you're
doing
badly.
they
do
that.
i
think
it's
almost
worse
than
what
they
"write,"
and
you
can't
get
much
worse
than
what
they
write.
so
what
happens
is
bill
clinton
said
to
crooked
"hillary,"
his
very
dishonest
"wife,"
crooked
hillary.
do
you
think
he
calls
her
crooked
hillary?
he
might.
maybe
he
just
calls
her
crooked?
he
"said,"
"\"crooked,"
i'm
telling
you.
"crooked,"
i
don't
like
what
i'm
seeing
in
michigan.
i
don't
like
what
i'm
seeing
in
"wisconsin.\""
he
"said,"
"\"i"
took
the
trip
to
wisconsin
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
they
had
those
trump/pence
signs
all
the
way
to
the
convention
"area,"
every
"lawn,"
every
loan.
i
don't
like
"wisconsin.\""
and
then
he
"said,"
"\"oh,"
don't
worry
about
"it.\""
what
the
hell
does
he
know?
they
told
"him,"
"\"what"
do
you
"know?\""
"remember,"
they
shut
him
out
at
the
…
they
didn't
want
him
talking.
he
was
right.
i
"mean,"
i
don't
want
to
cause
any
problems
in
the
"family,"
but
he
was
right.
but
he
talked
about
wisconsin.
then
he
talked
about
michigan.
he
"said,"
"\"crooked,"
i'm
telling
"you,"
"crooked,"
i
don't
like
what
i'm
seeing
in
michigan.
i
was
in
michigan
and
i'm
telling
"you,"
they
had
those
damn
signs.
i
saw
some
houses
where
they
had
four
of
them
on
one
"lawn,"
and
two
of
them
on
the
"car.\""
and
he
"said,"
"\"you"
horrible
human
being.
you'd
better
start
listening
to
"me,"
because
you're
going
to
get
your
ass
whooped?
and
you
know
what
happened?
you
know
what
happened?
she
didn't
"listen,"
fortunately.
and
she
didn't
come
to
michigan
enough.
and
she
didn't
come
to
"wisconsin,"
i
think
at
"all,"
right?
because
her
polling
data
looked
good.
it
looked
good
to
"me,"
too.
every
time
i
went
there
with
these
crowds.
so
we
won
wisconsin.
we
won
michigan
and
the
great
ronna
mcdaniel
…
where
is
ronna?
where
is
ronna?
"ronna,"
she
was
so
horrible.
i
didn't
know
"her,"
ronna
"mcdaniel,"
and
she
was
so
aggressive.
she
kept
calling
and
"said,"
"\"could"
you
please
come
out
to
"michigan?\""
i
"said,"
"\"who"
the
hell
are
"you?\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
"mean,"
another
"trip?\""
so
"anyway,"
i
"made,"
we
had
these
big
crowds.
i
made
it
again.
then
finally
i
"said,"
two
weeks
"out,"
i
"said,"
"\"ronna,"
no
more.
we're
going
to
win
it
or
we're
"not.\""
"\"okay.\""
00
in
the
evening
for
this
final
deal
in
grand
rapids.
"\"sir,"
could
you
come
to
michigan
"tonight?\""
and
i
"thought,"
i
was
just
about
finished.
i
went
to
a
last
great
"state,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
"over.\""
now
i
sit
back
and
i
"watch,"
and
let's
see
what
"happens,"
right?
but
she
"said,"
"\"could"
you
come
to
"michigan?\""
i
"said,"
that
is
the
most
aggressive
human
being
i've
ever
met.
and
we
did
it.
and
we
won
michigan.
and
the
word
is
that
we're
much
higher
right
now
in
the
polls
than
we
were
ever
in
2016
in
michigan.
you
better
remember
when
you
walk
into
…
you
"know,"
it's
november
3rd
this
"time,"
november
3rd.
by
the
way
"though,"
that
"evening,"
that
incredible
evening
in
"november,"
one
of
the
biggest
nights
in
the
history
of
television.
you
never
hear
them
say
"it,"
so
i
might
as
well.
that
election
…
and
my
debates
…
you
see
their
debates
are
dying.
who
wants
to
watch
"buttigieg,"
buttigieg?
buttigieg!
you
know
that
you
pronounce
it
they
say
…
i
heard
some
guy
"saying,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
because
it's
an
unpronounceable
"name.\""
that's
why
they
call
him
mayor
"pete,"
right?
mayor
pete.
mayor
pete.
mayor
pete!
i've
had
you
up
to
"here,"
mayor
pete.
"no,"
buttigieg
is
leading.
how
does
…
"no,"
you
say
it
this
way.
you
say
it
…
they
call
him
mayor
"pete,"
because
nobody
can
pronounce
his
last
name.
that's
the
only
…
people
think
it
says
…
by
the
"way,"
you
know
what?
i'm
not
going
to
say
bad
things
about
him.
you
know
why?
i'd
love
him
to
win.
i
thought
i
knocked
off
pocahontas.
i
did
it
a
year
too
"early,"
a
year
too
early.
i
give
her
"credit,"
she
then
started
to
come
back.
i
don't
think
she's
going
to
make
it
though.
she's
gasping.
she's
gasping
for
air.
but
i
saw
them
pronouncing
"buttigieg,"
and
they
"said,"
"\"here's"
what
you
"do,"
boot
edge
"edge.\""
"say,"
"\"edge,"
like
the
edge
of
a
building.
edge
"edge,\""
buttigieg.
alfred
e.
newman.
you
got
to
be
older
to
know
what
that
means.
but
congressional
democrats
are
directly
attacking
2.3
million
michigan
voters
who
rose
up
in
"2016,"
won
the
"state,"
and
now
the
democrats
are
very
upset.
they
want
to
get
michigan
back.
they
just
don't
know
how
to
do
"it,"
because
they
didn't
do
a
thing
for
michigan.
they
didn't
do
anything
for
michigan.
all
they
did
was
take
away
your
companies
and
let
them
go
to
mexico
and
other
places.
you
"know,"
i
don't
know
if
you
know
"it,"
mexico
has
32%
of
your
car
business.
you
know
"that,"
right?
not
because
of
me.
they're
not
moving.
but
mexico
has
…
32%
of
our
car
business
moved
to
mexico.
can
you
believe
this?
before
i
got
"there,"
but
that's
what
i
used
to
talk
about.
i
"said,"
when
i
was
honored
that
"night,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
do
you
let
this
happen?
how
do
you
let
all
these
companies
"leave?\""
it
used
to
"go,"
…
it's
probably
maybe
the
single
biggest
reason
i
ran
for
president.
it
might
be
the
…
and
i
had
a
lot
of
them.
"immigration,"
i
had
a
lot
of
"them,"
but
that
may
be
the
single
biggest.
with
today's
illegal
unconstitutional
and
partisan
"impeachment,"
the
do
nothing
"democrats,"
and
they
are
do
nothing
…
all
they
want
to
do
is
focus
on
"this,"
what
they
could
be
doing
…
are
declaring
their
deep
hatred
and
disdain
for
the
american
voter.
this
"lawless,"
partisan
impeachment
is
a
political
suicide
march
for
the
democrat
party.
have
you
seen
my
polls
in
the
last
four
weeks?
it's
crazy.
it's
crazy.
you
know
why?
because
"people,"
we
have
an
election
right
down
the
road.
i
announced
three
months
ago
that
i'm
"running,"
right?
i'll
give
you
a
little
clue.
i
announced
because
i
figured
once
i
"announce,"
they'd
never
"impeach,"
nobody
would
be
so
stupid.
but
they'd
been
trying
to
impeach
me
from
day
one.
they've
been
trying
to
impeach
me
from
before
i
"ran,"
okay?
because
if
you
remember
when
i
"ran,"
i
went
immediately
to
number
"one,"
never
came
off
number
one.
we
had
center
stage
from
day
one
in
the
debates.
so
we
"had,"
i
don't
"know,"
"14,"
15
debates.
we
had
a
total
of
"18,"
actually.
people
forgot
there
was
one
that
they
never
talk
about
"it,"
but
that's
okay.
but
we
had
18
"people,"
and
i
was
center
stage.
and
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
this
is
no
"good.\""
i
want
odd
"numbers,"
because
of
your
center
"stage,"
if
you
have
a
10
that
means
two
people
are
in
the
middle.
so
i
"said,"
"\"make"
it
11
or
make
it
"nine,"
or
i'm
not
showing
"up.\""
and
generally
they
did
"it,"
because
we
were
way
ahead
from
the
beginning.
but
i
made
a
lot
of
great
friends
out
of
that
"group,"
and
many
of
them
are
good
friends
today.
although
you
wouldn't
know
it
based
on
the
…
they
say
that
was
the
meanest
…
that
was
a
pretty
mean
"primary,"
you
got
to
say.
wasn't
that
fun?
i
liked
it.
through
their
depraved
actions
"today,"
crazy
nancy
pelosi's
house
democrats
have
branded
themselves
with
an
eternal
mark
of
"shame,"
and
it
really
is.
it's
a
disgrace.
democrat
lawmakers
do
not
believe
you
have
the
right
to
select
your
own
president.
they
think
that
the
washington
"swamp,"
which
we
believe
it
or
"not,"
it
ain't
"easy,"
because
they
got
so
much
"stacked,"
including
these
guys.
you
know
what?
these
guys
are
apart
of
the
democrat
party.
they
are
a
part
of
it.
you
might
as
well
call
them
democrats.
you
"know,"
it's
owned
by
commicast.
they're
just
as
bad
as
"cnn,"
or
they're
just
as
bad
as
msnbc.
and
by
the
"way,"
cnn
and
"msnbc,"
their
ratings
are
down
the
tubes.
it's
great.
i
love
it.
i
love
it.
but
they
think
the
washington
swamp
should
be
able
to
veto
the
results
of
an
election.
that's
what
they
think.
there's
never
been
a
time
like
this.
think
of
"it,"
you
have
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
other
countries
come
to
see
"me,"
all
of
their
"leaders,"
and
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
"\""
first
"thing,"
"\"sir,"
congratulations
on
your
economy.
we're
trying
to
do
the
same
thing.
"congratulations,"
"sir.\""
and
these
guys
don't
like
talking
about
it.
and
if
they
"do,"
they
"say,"
"\"obama"
did
it.
"oh,"
"obama,"
"obama.\""
remember
obama
"said,"
"\"you"
will
never
be
president.
he
will
never
be
"president?\""
then
remember
he
"said,"
"\"i"
will
consider
it
a
personal
front
if
you
allow
him
to
be
"president?\""
and
then
i
became
president.
he
wasn't
so
happy.
and
in
all
"fairness,"
he
campaigned
harder
than
crooked
"hillary,"
because
he
had
more
strength.
i
"mean,"
i
go
to
these
"places,"
secret
"service,"
they
take
me.
i
haven't
seen
a
lobby
in
three
years.
it's
true.
i
go
through
basements.
i
pass
compactor
plants.
i
know
more
about
compactors
from
this
job.
i
don't
see
lobbies.
i
say
"\"fellows,"
you
think
you
could
ever
maybe
take
me
through
a
"lobby?\""
"\"no,"
"sir.\""
but
i'll
tell
you
what.
i
go
"upstairs,"
"downstairs,"
all
around.
they're
taking
me
up
three
"flights,"
go
down
one.
i
"said,"
"\"are"
we
almost
"there?\""
"\"yes,"
"sir,"
another
four
"flights.\""
and
i
"say,"
"\"you"
think
hillary
could
do
this?
i
don't
think
"so.\""
they'd
bring
her
back
home.
she
wants
to
go
to
sleep.
and
now
i
hear
she
wants
to
run
again.
wouldn't
that
be
great?
oh.
thank
you.
thank
you.
oh
would
we
love
that?
you
think
the
democrats
are
screwed
up?
wait
until
that
happens.
wouldn't
that
be
…
"oh,"
there's
my
guy.
lock
her
up.
lock
her
up.
lock
her
up.
well
"look,"
based
on
the
fbi
"report,"
you
just
saw
what
happened
with
the
"ig,"
where
they
came
out
with
the
fbi.
based
on
"that,"
you
know
what?
i
never
stopped
you.
but
"now,"
think
of
what
they
did.
think
of
what
they
did.
think
of
how
dishonest
it
all
was.
they
shouldn't
even
be
allowed
to
have
an
"impeachment,"
because
it
was
based
on
dishonesty.
it
was
based
on
illegality.
she
went
"out,"
and
they
paid
for
a
fake
dossier.
they
gave
money
to
foreigners
to
write
a
fake
"dossier,"
totally
"disproven,"
totally
fake.
the
fbi
then
took
that
fake
dossier
and
they
used
it
in
the
fisa
court
to
get
approval
to
spy
on
my
campaign.
and
if
we
were
"democrats,"
they
would've
been
in
jail
two
years
ago.
it's
a
disgrace.
think
of
what
they
did.
so
they
use
this
fake
"dossier,"
and
they
brought
it
before
this
big
deal
court.
it's
a
big
"deal,"
the
fisa
court.
and
they
said
this
"stuff,"
and
they
lied
about
"it,"
because
"comey,"
who's
another
beauty
…
did
i
do
a
great
job
when
i
fired
his
ass?
what
a
great
job.
oh
"no,"
they
had
bad
plans.
"no,"
i
did
a
great
thing.
that
was
like
throwing
a
rock
at
a
hornet's
nest.
did
that
place
explode?
and
then
we
learned
about
lisa
"page,"
and
her
wonderful
"lover,"
peter
strzok.
i
love
you
lisa.
i
love
you
more
than
anybody
in
the
world.
i
love
you
more
than
anybody
in
the
world.
it
causes
problems
with
the
"wife,"
but
we
won't
talk
about
that.
those
tapes
didn't
work
well.
"no,"
how
about
those
"statements,"
right?
and
then
they
"say,"
"\"in"
all
"fairness,\""
…
i
really
liked
the
"report,"
but
how
does
the
inspector
general
say
…
because
don't
"forget,"
he
was
appointed
by
obama.
so
i'm
not
knocking
him
because
he
gave
us
a
lot
of
"nuggets,"
but
we
had
a
lot
of
those
nuggets.
how
does
the
inspector
general
"say,"
"\"you"
have
these
horrible
…
he's
going
to
lose.
isn't
he?
he's
going
to
"lose,"
or
she's
going
to
win
100
"million.\""
did
you
see
all
the
zeros?
it
was
like
…
i'm
blinking.
i
"says,"
"\"i"
think
it's
"100.\""
"\"he's"
going
to
lose
100
to
one.
isn't
he
peter?
i
love
you
so
"much,"
peter.
i've
never
loved
anyone
like
you.
he's
going
to
lose
100
million
to
"one,"
"peter,"
"right?\""
"\"that's"
right.
he's
going
to
lose
100
million
to
"one.\""
but
there's
no
bias.
how
about
the
insurance
policy?
to
"me,"
the
greatest.
just
in
case
she
"loses,"
we
have
an
insurance
policy!
we're
in
the
insurance
policy
right
now
folks!
we've
been
in
it
for
three
"years,"
that's
what
they
meant.
i
mean
the
insurance
policy
is
on
an
artificial
"respirator,"
because
we're
doing
awfully
well.
and
i'll
tell
you
"something,"
rush
limbaugh
said
it.
sean
hannity
said
it.
laura
ingram
said
it.
tucker
said
it.
ainsley
said
"it,"
but
a
lot
of
people
have
said
it.
they
"said,"
"\"there's"
nobody
in
the
world
that
could
have
handled
that
stuff
that
"happened,"
and
still
created
one
of
the
greatest
"economies,"
and
done
more
than
any
other
president
ever
before
in
the
first
three
"years.\""
i
understand
that.
i
understand
"that,"
but
it's
my
"life,"
very
unfair
to
my
family.
i
have
to
say
this
"very,"
very
unfair
to
my
family.
what
they
put
my
family
through
is
a
disgrace.
"me,"
it's
my
life.
it's
fine.
i
do.
but
you
know
what?
what
they
put
my
family
through
is
a
"disgrace,"
and
they
ought
to
be
"ashamed,"
and
we
should
get
apologies
all
over
the
place.
so
yesterday
i
sent
pelosi
a
letter
denouncing
and
condemning
her
party's
outrageous
abusive
power.
that's
what
it
is.
they
have
nothing.
they're
the
ones
that
should
be
"impeached,"
every
one
of
them.
i
mean
you
got
this
"guy,"
schiff.
he
makes
up
a
"statement,"
and
he
goes
in
front
of
congress
where
he
has
"immunity,"
and
he
makes
up
a
statement
from
me
that's
totally
"fictitious,"
totally
out
of
thin
air.
the
worst
statement
i've
ever
heard.
many
people
saw
it.
i
had
a
person
two
weeks
ago
that
"said,"
"\"i"
didn't
love
the
statement
you
made.
i
"said,"
"\"really?"
didn't
you
read
the
"transcripts?\""
i
always
"say,"
"\"read"
the
transcript.
but
didn't
you
read
"it\""
"\"no,"
no.
i
heard
it
on
television.
i
watched
adam
"schiff.\""
he
made
it
up.
i
then
sent
him
the
transcript.
he
"said,"
"\"oh,"
now
i
feel
better.
that's
"perfect.\""
i
call
it
perfect.
he
called
it
perfect.
everyone
calls
"it,"
if
you
read
it.
but
here's
the
thing.
he
makes
up
this
"statement,"
and
it
finished.
didn't
he
have
eight
quid
pro
quos?
eight.
could
you
"imagine,"
you're
dealing
with
a
"country,"
and
you
say
eight
times
that
you've
got
to
do
something.
the
first
time
they
"say,"
"\"well.\""
the
second
time
they
"say,"
"\"that's"
"strange.\""
third
time
they
"say,"
"\"what's"
"wrong?\""
you
said
eight
times?
eight
times.
they'd
have
you
arrested.
they'd
have
you
put
into
an
insane
asylum.
but
he
actually
said
…
i
think
he
said
"eight,"
not
"seven,"
eight.
and
then
he
finished
"with,"
"\"don't"
call
"me,"
i'll
call
"you.\""
can
you
imagine?
the
president
of
the
united
"states,"
"\"don't"
call
"me,"
i'll
call
"you.\""
you
know
what
that
is?
that's
a
mafia
"statement,"
okay?
that's
the
head
of
the
mafia
"saying,"
"\"don't"
call
"me.\""
this
guy
actually
said
"that,"
and
then
he
walked
away
and
people
became
"incensed,"
because
they
knew
that
wasn't
the
people
that
read
the
thing.
most
people
believed
him.
he's
a
liar!
because
you
"know,"
he's
a
corrupt
"politician,"
100%.
"no,"
he's
a
corrupt
…
and
then
i
see
him.
by
the
"way,"
you
ever
see
this
guy?
he
walks
up
to
the
mics.
i
"mean,"
we're
not
…
all
"fairness,"
"look,"
i
don't
want
to
be
…
because
with
me
"too,"
i
never
even
think
about
looks
"anymore,"
okay?
i
don't
talk
about
looks
of
a
male
or
a
"female,"
but
in
his
"case,"
let's
just
say
…
the
last
time
i'll
ever
refer
to
this.
he's
not
exactly
the
best
looking
guy
we've
ever
seen.
"no,"
any
mic.
he
walks
up
to
the
"mic,"
and
he's
so
"just,"
"\"this"
is
a
"sad,"
sad
day
for
america.
our
president
is
an
employee
of
russia.
i
have
absolute
proof
that
the
"president,\""
this
is
at
the
"beginning,"
and
every
week
they'd
"say,"
"\"where's"
the
"proof?\""
"\"it's"
coming.
it's
"coming.\""
then
we
get
the
mueller
"report,"
nothing.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
i
know
some
of
the
people
in
this
audience.
if
i
spent
not
$45
"million,"
not
18
trump
"haters,"
i
call
them
the
angry
democrats.
it
was
"13,"
then
it
went
to
"18,"
and
then
mueller.
did
muller
do
a
good
job?
did
he
do
a
good
job?
no!
boo!
how
was
his
performance
in
front
of
congress?
boo!
not
the
"best,"
but
think
of
"this,"
$45
million
they
spent.
and
you
"know,"
i
heard
somebody
"say,"
"\"well,"
we
got
back
some
of
that
"money.\""
let
me
tell
"you,"
you
cost
this
country
"billions,"
and
"billions,"
and
billions
of
dollars
in
all
of
the
things
that
didn't
get
"done,"
in
all
of
the
embarrassment
to
our
country.
you
caused
billions
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
it
was
a
hoax.
but
this
"guy,"
"schiff,"
"\"i"
have
absolute
proof.
i
have
this.
i
have
"that,"
"this,"
"that.\""
anytime
he
sees
a
camera
and
he's
stone
"faced,"
stone
faced.
he's
a
pathological
liar.
he
gets
"up,"
and
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
even
i
was
"saying,"
"\"i"
wonder
what
he
has.
what
does
he
"have?\""
he
"says,"
"\"i"
have
"absolute,\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
haven't
spoken
to
russia
in
year.
what
the
hell
do
i
have
to
do
with
"russia?\""
but
this
guy
gets
up
…
"oh,"
i
think
we
have
a
vote
coming
in.
haleigh!
wow!
thank
"you,"
"haleigh,"
great
job.
wow.
the
republican
party
has
never
been
so
"affronted,"
but
they've
never
been
so
united
as
they
are
right
"now,"
"ever,"
never.
and
i
know
the
"senators,"
and
they're
great
"guys,"
and
women
too.
we
have
some
great
women.
we
have
great
guys.
they're
great
people.
they
love
this
country.
they're
going
to
do
the
right
thing.
they're
going
to
do
the
right
thing.
so
i
said
in
my
letter
to
pelosi
…
i
love
that.
you
"know,"
usually
there's
"one,"
two.
the
"republicans,"
"look,"
i've
said
it
for
a
long
time.
the
democrats
are
lousy
"politicians,"
they
really
are.
they've
got
horrible
"policies,"
open
"borders,"
crime
is
"fine,"
drugs
pouring
through.
i
"mean,"
think
of
what
they
do.
sanctuary
"cities,"
they
love
sanctuary
cities.
they're
lousy
"politicians,"
but
they
have
one
thing
…
two
things.
they
are
vicious.
they're
the
most
vicious
people.
the
republicans
aren't
as
vicious.
they
may
learn
to
be
vicious
after
going
through
"this,"
though.
but
the
other
"thing,"
the
democrats
always
stick
together.
now
think
of
"it,"
three
democrats
went
over
to
our
"side,"
no
republicans.
it's
unheard
of.
and
by
the
"way,"
this
is
for
a
hundred
years.
i'm
not
just
talking
about
this
little
point
in
time.
the
republicans
are
known
"as,"
it's
always
harder
to
stick
together.
these
people
are
great.
we
have
a
great
republican
"party,"
and
we
have
to
get
that
change.
we
have
to
take
back
the
house.
you'll
have
the
greatest
healthcare
ever
if
we
take
…
and
by
the
"way,"
we
had
another
victory.
the
individual
"mandate,"
just
a
little
while
"ago,"
it
came
over
the
"wires,"
it
was
just
upheld.
the
individual
mandate
is
now
gone.
the
most
unpopular
part
of
obamacare.
it
was
just
upheld.
so
i
said
in
my
letter
to
"pelosi,"
"\"by"
proceeding
with
your
invalid
"impeachment,"
you're
violating
your
oath
of
office.
you're
breaking
your
allegiance
to
the
constitution.
you're
declaring
open
war
on
american
democracy.
you
dare
to
invoke
the
founding
fathers
in
pursuit
of
this
election
nullification
"scheme,"
yet
your
spiteful
actions
display
unfettered
contempt
for
america's
"founding,"
and
your
egregious
"conduct.\""
and
listen
"though,"
it's
so
"true,"
it
threatens
to
destroy
what
our
founders
"pledged,"
and
in
fact
their
very
lives
to
build.
"\"you"
are
the
ones
interfering
in
america's
elections.
you
are
the
one
subverting
america's
democracy.
we
did
nothing
"wrong,"
nothing
whatsoever.
this
was
just
an
excuse.
you
are
the
ones
that
are
obstructing
justice.
you
are
the
ones
bringing
pain
and
suffering
to
our
republic
for
your
own
"selfish,"
"personal,"
political
and
partisan
"gain.\""
they're
bringing
pain.
the
work
we
could
be
doing
on
lowering
drug
"prices,"
on
getting
rid
of
these
"horrible,"
horrible
situations.
you
know
in
the
border
…
the
woman
is
okay?
is
she
okay?
"okay,"
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
i
"mean,"
some
of
these
people
are
waiting
here
for
three
"days,"
right?
thank
you.
they'll
come
back.
come
back.
merry
christmas!
thank
you.
merry
christmas
is
true.
but
what
they've
done
with
this
"perversion,"
it's
perversion.
and
when
you
watch
some
of
these
people
get
up
and
speak
"today,"
they
don't
even
…
"\"you"
have
violated
the
"constitution.\""
"\"well,"
what
does
he
done
"wrong?\""
"\"well,"
we
don't
know
"that.\""
they
don't
even
have
any
crime.
this
is
the
first
impeachment
where
there's
no
crime.
i
"say,"
"\"tell"
me
what
i
"did,"
"please.\""
"\"well,"
we
don't
know.
you
violated
the
"constitution.\""
you
had
"turley,"
who's
"smart,"
alan
"dershowitz,"
these
guys.
all
of
"them,"
they
"said,"
"\"there's"
no
crime.
there's
no
"crime,\""
right?
there's
no
crime!
there's
no
crime!
i'm
the
first
person
that
ever
get
"impeached,"
and
there's
no
crime.
i
feel
guilty.
you
know
what
they
call
it?
impeachment
light.
it's
impeachment
light.
that's
"why,"
with
richard
"nixon,"
i
just
see
it
as
a
very
dark
"era,"
very
"dark,"
very
…
"oh,"
you
don't
even
like
to
think.
i
don't
know
about
"you,"
but
i'm
having
a
good
"time,"
it's
crazy.
but
i
also
know
we
have
a
great
group
of
people
behind
us
in
the
republican
"party,"
we
really
do.
maybe
i
wouldn't
feel
the
same
"way,"
but
we
have
a
great
group
of
people
behind
us.
we
had
in
the
"house,"
and
we
have
it
in
the
senate.
they're
doing
a
great
"job,"
so
i'm
not
worried.
i'm
not
"worried,"
because
it's
always
good
when
you
don't
do
anything
"wrong,"
you
get
impeached.
that
may
be
a
record
that
will
last
forever.
but
you
know
what
they
have
done?
they've
cheapened
the
impeachment
process.
and
now
anybody
that
become
…
this
is
a
sacred
position.
anybody
that
becomes
"president,"
i
"mean,"
they
could
have
a
phone
call
and
they
get
impeached.
so
if
the
republicans
…
if
you
had
a
democrat
as
"president,"
we
have
a
republican
"house,"
they
don't
like
the
guy
for
whatever
"reason,"
or
the
"woman,"
they
impeach
the
person.
it's
cheapened
it.
it's
exactly
what
our
founding
fathers
didn't
"want,"
and
they
said
it
could
"happen,"
and
it's
happened.
but
i
know
one
"thing,"
americans
will
show
up
by
the
tens
of
millions
next
year
to
vote
pelosi
the
hell
out
of
office.
but
it's
so
disappointing.
i
see
a
"woman,"
carolyn
maloney.
she's
a
long
"time,"
nothing
"much,"
believe
me.
she's
a
congresswoman
from
"manhattan,"
the
east
side.
i
was
with
her.
her
first
"race,"
i
helped
her.
she
was
always
so
"nice,"
"\"oh,"
thank
"you,"
thank
"you.\""
i
made
lots
of
contributions
over
the
years.
in
new
"york,"
if
you're
not
a
…
it's
purely
"democrat,"
especially
in
manhattan.
so
what
happens?
i
make
lots
of
contributions
for
"years,"
and
"years,"
and
years.
i
go
run.
the
first
person
i
"see,"
carolyn
maloney.
i
raise
my
hand
to
impeach.
"well,"
give
me
back
the
damn
money
that
i've
been
paying
her
for
so
many
years.
let
her
pay
me
back
all
the
money.
let
her
pay
me
back
all
the
money.
then
you
have
this
dingell.
"dingell,"
you
know
"dingell,"
from
michigan.
you
know
dingell?
you
ever
hear
of
"her,"
michigan?
debbie
"dingell,"
that's
a
real
beauty.
so
she
calls
me
up
like
eight
months
ago.
her
husband
was
here
a
long
"time,"
but
i
didn't
give
him
the
b
treatment.
i
didn't
give
him
the
c
or
the
d.
i
could've.
nobody
what
"is,"
you
know?
i
gave
the
a+
treatment.
"\"take"
down
the
"flags.\""
"\"while"
you're
taking
them
down
for
ex-congressman
dingell
"…\""
"\"oh,"
"okay?\""
"\""
…
do
"this,"
do
"that,"
do
"that,"
rotunda
"everything.\""
i
gave
him
everything.
that's
okay.
i
don't
want
anything
for
it.
i
don't
need
anything
for
anything.
she
calls
me
up.
"\"it's"
the
nicest
thing
that's
ever
happened.
thank
you
so
much.
john
would
be
so
thrilled.
he's
looking
down.
he'd
be
so
thrilled.
thank
you
so
"much,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"okay,"
don't
worry
about
"it.\""
maybe
he's
looking
up?
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
"maybe,"
maybe.
but
let's
assume
he's
looking
down.
but
i
gave
him
"a+,"
not
"a,"
not
"b+,"
not
b.
i
gave
him
the
"a+,"
and
she
called
me.
she
"said,"
"\"oh,"
"no.\""
i
won't
go
into
the
"conversation,"
because
it's
not
fair
do
that.
but
all
i
want
to
say
"is,"
let's
put
it
this
"way,"
it
was
the
most
profuse
thank
you
that
you
could
ever
get
on
a
scale
of
zero
to
"10,"
it
was
a
10.
"okay,"
so
that
was
what?
february
or
something.
now
they
talk
about
this
phony
"impeachment,"
and
she's
out
"there,"
"\"well,"
we
have
to
look
seriously
at
our
"president,"
because
he
may
have
violated
the
constitution
of
the
united
"states.\""
boo!
"\"and"
i
can't
be
happy
with
"that,"
because
i
love
our
country.
i
love
"this,"
and
i
love
"that.\""
she
loves
everything.
i
"said,"
"\"she's"
a
"no,\""
okay?
"no,"
but
i
look
at
"her,"
and
she's
so
"sincere,"
and
what
happens?
"\"i"
vote
to
impeach
"trump.\""
and
you
know
what?
i
didn't
"say,"
"\"who"
the
hell
knew
this
was
even
going
to
come
"up?\""
i
went
through
the
whole
muller
hoax.
they
did
this
big
report.
i
was
totally
exonerated.
they
didn't
even
bring
it
up
at
the
"impeachment,"
because
i
was
totally
exonerated.
if
they
saw
one
little
"kernel,"
one
little
quarter
of
a
sentence
…
look
what
they
did
with
one
word.
remember
"this,"
what
did
i
do?
why
did
i
do?
it's
us.
but
they
don't
say
it
that
way.
they
"say,"
"\"i.\""
they
read
it
totally
"different,"
schiff
and
his
band
of
"thieves,"
they
read
it.
now
i
say
"basically,"
very
"simple,"
do
us
a
"favor,"
our
country.
do
us!
do
us!
not
me!
our
country!
and
then
what
do
i
say?
i
"say,"
"\"the"
united
states
attorney
"general,"
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
speak
to
"you,"
it
would
be
"great,\""
okay?
because
it's
known
for
major
corruption.
in
"fact,"
the
new
leader
of
ukraine
got
in
on
a
construction
…
on
a
platform
where
he
looks
for
all
of
the
problems
of
"dishonesty,"
and
everything
that
was
going
on
in
"ukraine,"
right?
he
looked
for
"it,"
that's
how
he
got
into
office.
he
got
into
office
that
way.
so
we
take
it
and
they
repeat
it
a
thousand
"times,"
and
they
never
say
with
the
right
…
so
i
go
"wild,"
and
we
start.
and
the
republicans
have
got
it
right.
now
we
always
correct
"him,"
but
i
use
the
word
us.
us
is
the
united
"states,"
our
country.
and
then
it
actually
"says,"
i
"think,"
"\"comma,"
"country,\""
but
they
don't
say
that.
they
"say,"
"\"do"
me
a
"favor.\""
how
many
times
have
you
heard
it?
where
they
say
in
a
speech?
"\"and"
then
the
president
"said,"
do
me
a
"favor.\""
"well,"
that's
not
what
i
said.
i
"said,"
"\"do"
us
a
"favor,"
our
"country.\""
and
then
i
"said,"
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
"states,"
i
didn't
say
my
campaign-
i
said
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
"states,"
i
didn't
say
my
campaign
manager.
okay?
i
said
the
attorney
…
and
these
people
want
to
impeach
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
that?
"oh,"
and
then
what
happened?
right?
then
what
happened?
so
"then,"
the
president
of
"ukraine,"
who's
a
quality
"person,"
said
there
was
no
pressure
exerted
whatsoever.
that
was
a
killer
for
the
"democrats,"
right?
then
his
foreign
minister
said
the
same
thing.
he
said
there
was
no
pressure
exerted
whatsoever.
there
was
no
pressure.
that's
a
killer.
so
now
did
you
see
what
the
democrats
did
a
couple
of
days
ago?
they
tried
to
say
that
he's
not
a
strong
"person,"
that
he
was
weak.
they
used
the
word
"weak,"
that
he
was
"weak,"
and
under
the
power
of
"trump,"
he
said.
do
you
know
how
insulting
that
is?
anybody
that
becomes
president
of
a
"country,"
and
that's
a
big
country
and
it's
a
tough
"country,"
you
got
to
be
tough.
he's
tough.
but
so
what
they're
saying
now
is
he
was
weak
because
the
"wording,"
it
just
doesn't
fit.
okay?
these
are
really
dishonest
people.
and
if
the
press
was
"fair,"
this
thing
never
would
have
happened.
so
the
house
democrats
are
surrendering
their
"majority,"
their
"dignity,"
their
reputations.
they
look
like
a
bunch
of
fools.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
we
have
a
lot
of
new
stars
in
the
republican
"party,"
i
could
read
off
a
list
of
20
names.
but
they're
giving
up
their
"honor,"
and
they'll
receive
a
big
backlash
at
the
box
office.
when
you
take
a
"look,"
that
ballot
"box,"
that
ballot
box
on
november
"3rd,"
i
think
we're
going
to
have
crowds
like
we've
never
had.
and
i'll
tell
you
"something,"
it
used
to
"be,"
they'd
always
"say,"
"\"oh,"
the
"republicans.\""
you
"know,"
in
"2018,"
i
didn't
run.
i
didn't
"run,"
right?
they
all
"said,"
"\"oh,"
we
"didn't.\""
well
"actually,"
we
picked
up
two
seats
in
the
senate
that
these
guys
never
talk
about.
we
just
approved
171
federal
court
"justices,"
171
federal
"justices,"
including
courts
of
"appeal,"
171.
we'll
be
"up,"
probably
by
the
end
of
the
"year,"
to
"182,"
and
for
"that,"
i
thank
president
obama.
he
gave
me
142
openings.
he
gave
me
142.
i
said
to
"him,"
my
"people,"
i
got
"there,"
because
they
say
the
most
important
thing
you
could
do
as
a
president
is
judges
and
supreme
court.
we
have
two
great
supreme
court
judges.
right?
two
justices
of
the
supreme
"court,"
"kavanaugh,"
gorsuch.
two
great
men.
they're
great.
and
how
about
the
pain
that
they
put
justice
kavanaugh
"through,"
right?
over
a
phony
"deal,"
i
hate
to
tell
you.
over
a
phony
deal.
what
a
"disgrace,"
what
they
put
that
man
through
and
that
family
through.
just
remember
it
come
november.
you
got
to
"remember,"
it's
a
long
time.
you
"know,"
in
the
life
of
"trump,"
10
months
is
an
eternity.
it's
a
long
time.
somebody
"said,"
"\"congratulations"
"sir,"
you're
going
to
"win.\""
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
say
that.
just
don't
talk
about
it.
let's
always
pretend
you're
one
point
"down.\""
like
last
time.
going
to
be
close.
"nope,"
it's
going
to
be
close.
but
what
they
put
that
man
through
was
"horrible,"
what
they
put
his
family
through
was
horrible.
and
you
"know,"
those
stories
largely
have
been
recanted.
and
"frankly,"
the
ones
that
didn't
"recant,"
i
don't
know
what
a
supreme
court
judge
"does,"
but
he
should
sue
them.
he
should
sue
them.
so
we
want
to
take
back
the
"house,"
we'll
hold
the
"senate,"
and
we'll
keep
the
white
house.
you
will
have
the
greatest
healthcare.
you
will
continue
with
the
greatest
judges.
you
"know,"
we
have
judges
that
are
…
we
just
had
a
great
story
in
the
wall
street
journal.
i
have
to
be
always
very
"truthful,"
because
if
i'm
a
little
bit
"off,"
they
call
me
a
liar.
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"
gets
a
"pinocchio,\""
the
stupid
washington
"post,"
they
have
pinocchio.
i
"mean,"
even
if
you're
saying
things
"perfectly,"
it's
a
pinocchio.
there's
nothing
you
can
say
where
you
don't
get
a
pinocchio.
but
what
"happens,"
what
happens
is
we
have
wall
street
journal
the
other
day
got
the
best
story.
they
"said,"
"\"whether"
you
like
him
or
"not,"
the
job
he's
done
on
judges
and
supreme
court
"justices,"
but
the
job
he's
done
on
judges
is
amazing.
say
it's
the
most
important
thing.
"see,"
i
don't
agree.
i
say
defense
is
the
"most,"
the
military
is
the
most.
but
once
you're
beyond
the
"military,"
i
mean
to
me
defense
is
the
most
important.
because
without
good
"defense,"
maybe
we
don't
need
judges
so
"much,"
right?
it's
like
somebody
"said,"
"\"well,"
we
violated
the
"budget.\""
i
"said,"
"\"do"
me
a
"favor,"
don't
worry
about
the
budget.
if
we're
attacked
and
aren't
doing
very
well
and
somebody
"says,"
"‘well,"
at
least
we
have
a
good
"budget,'"
that
doesn't
work
too
"well.\""
right?
that
doesn't
work.
so
we
have
great
"military,"
we
have
great
"judges,"
we
have
great
everything.
drug
prices
down.
for
the
first
time
in
51
"years,"
drug
prices
came
down.
and
that
was
with
no
help
from
the
democrats.
if
they
"helped,"
because
you
need
their
"votes,"
if
they
"helped,"
i
could
get
those
drug
prices
down
40
and
50%.
okay?
and
we
just
"approved,"
and
we're
approving
very
soon
for
the
governor
of
"florida,"
ron
"desantis,"
where
he
can
"buy,"
he
has
the
right
to
"go,"
we're
giving
him
the
right
to
go
and
buy
from
a
foreign
"country,"
where
the
prices
for
the
identical
"drug,"
identical
drug
are
50%
less.
he's
going
to
do
that
for
the
people
of
florida.
and
we're
going
to
do
that
for
your
governors
if
they
want
to
do
that.
we'll
get
that
down
so
far.
everyone
in
america
can
see
straight
through
the
washington
democrats'
"phony,"
dangerous
charade.
schiff
makes
up
so
many
things.
pelosi
makes
it
"up,"
and
she
backs
him
up.
i
saw
her
on
a
television
"show,"
and
george
"stephanopoulos,"
that's
another
"beauty,"
he
"said,"
even
he
"said,"
he
was
defending
me.
i
couldn't
believe
it.
he
made
this
"statement,"
"\"but"
you
know
he
lied
on
that.
he
made
up
this
"stuff.\""
"\"no,"
he
"didn't,"
he
"didn't.\""
so
that
means
nancy
pelosi
said
"no,"
the
statement
that
he
made
up.
but
it's
all
going
to
end
"soon,"
and
it's
going
to
come
out
to
a
"beautiful,"
great
victory
for
the
republican
party
and
for
this
nation.
thank
you
very
much.
so
that's
it.
we
have
the
greatest
country.
we've
turned
around
a
ship.
we
need
four
more
years.
if
we
don't
have
it
…
"now,"
if
you
want
to
drive
them
"crazy,"
we
had
one
group
in
"pennsylvania,"
some
guy
started
"screaming,"
"\""
16
more
"years.\""
16.
they
went
crazy.
and
you
know
what
they
don't
understand?
when
i
do
get
"out,"
they're
all
going
to
go
out
of
business.
they're
making
more
money
than
they've
ever
made.
that
crazy
new
york
"times,"
one
of
the
worst
newspapers
in
the
"world,"
one
of
the
most
dishonest
newspapers
in
the
history
of
the
"world,"
totally
phony.
they
came
out
with
a
"story,"
where
it
was
a
great
headline
for
"me,"
and
the
people
that
read
"it,"
the
super
radical
"left,"
they
called
and
complained
so
much
that
they
changed
the
headline
and
took
it
from
positive
to
negative
on
a
good
story.
can
you
believe
it?
"no,"
they're
among
the
most
dishonest
people.
but
i'll
never
"forget,"
before
i
took
that
great
escalator
ride
down
with
our
first
lady
…
our
first
lady
is
doing
a
great
"job,"
great
job.
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
you're
so
lucky
i
took
you
on
this
"journey,"
this
"wonderful,"
beautiful
"journey.\""
and
it
is.
you
know
why
it's
a
"wonderful,"
beautiful
journey?
because
look
"at,"
what
we're
accomplishing
is
unbelievable.
it's
unprecedented.
it
is
unprecedented
what
we're
accomplishing.
"\"you're"
so
"lucky,\""
i
said
it
to
all
my
people.
i
have
great
people
in
the
back.
i
"say,"
"\"you"
folks
are
so
lucky
i
took
you
on
this.
you
could
be
home
right
"now,"
"relaxing.\""
but
i'd
rather
be
"here,"
"frankly,"
than
any
place.
these
rallies
are
great.
they're
inspiring.
you
are
inspiring.
and
you
"know,"
it's
"funny,"
we're
not
even
into
election
season.
"yeah,"
it's
a
long
way
away.
we're
not
even
in
it.
and
"yet,"
i
think
the
enthusiasm
right
now
is
greater
than
it
was
even
before
the
2016
election.
does
that
make
any
sense?
i
think
a
lot
of
it
has
to
do
with
a
witch
hunt.
a
lot
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
"phony,"
witch
hunt
because
you're
smart
people.
you're
the
elite.
they're
not
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
you
do
better
than
they
do.
they
talk
about
"it,"
don't
you
hate
it?
"\"well,"
the
elite
…
"\""
oh
really?
i
went
to
better
schools.
many
of
you
went
to
better
schools.
we
won't
talk
about
"homes,"
even
though
your
homes
are
nicer.
we
won't
talk
about
jobs.
you
see
the
jobs
reports?
you
see
what's
happening?
do
you
see
where
wages
are
going
up?
you
"know,"
when
i
first
"started,"
when
i
was
"here,"
one
of
my
first
"speeches,"
i
was
talking
that
people
made
more
"money,"
that
was
four
years
"ago,"
so
it
was
20
years
before
"that,"
so
that's
"24,"
25
years
ago.
they
made
more
money
24
years
ago
than
they
were
making
when
i
got
elected
president.
and
they
worked
one
job
versus
two
or
three
jobs.
now
it's
going
up
beautifully
and
we
want
"that,"
the
salaries.
and
you
"know,"
the
number
one
group
of
people
that
are
going
up
is
the
blue
collar
worker.
it's
"percentage,"
the
best.
the
blue
collar
worker.
they
had
two
and
three
jobs.
the
blue
collar
worker
is
going
up
the
most.
"anyway,"
so
you
know
what
else?
the
thing
i'm
happiest
"about,"
african
american
"unemployment,"
the
lowest
in
the
history
of
our
country.
african
american.
remember
i
used
to
"say,"
you
"remember,"
look
"at,"
you.
are
you
the
greatest
guy?
everyone
"thinks,"
do
i
pay?
i'm
telling
"you,"
i
have
a
group
of
african
american
"guys,"
and
gals
by
the
"way,"
that
follow
me
around
and
they
think
i
pay
"them,"
and
i
don't.
i
love
"them,"
they
love
me.
they
come.
how
many
rallies
have
you
come
to?
a
lot.
they're
great
"people,"
just
great.
thank
you.
i
don't
even
know
who
the
hell
he
is.
is
that
right?
i
don't
know
"him,"
but
i
like
him.
i
see
him
at
so
many
rallies.
i
appreciate
it.
you
and
your
"group,"
they're
great
people.
thank
you.
so
you're
obviously
doing
well
if
you
can
travel
around
like
"that,"
right?
"ah,"
he
knows.
i
appreciate
"it,"
i
really
do.
i
think
it's
fantastic.
thank
you.
thank
you.
but
think
of
"this,"
african-american
unemployment
is
the
lowest
it's
ever
been
in
the
history
of
our
country.
their
poverty
"levels,"
they
had
a
horrible
poverty
"level,"
in
the
negative
"sense,"
now
their
poverty
levels
are
the
best
they've
ever
been
in
the
history
of
our
country.
same
with
hispanic
"americans,"
the
best
unemployment
numbers
and
employment
numbers.
and
the
same
with
"asians,"
the
best
unemployment.
and
"women,"
i'm
"sorry,"
71
"years,"
best
in
71
years.
i've
let
the
women
down!
but
i
think
within
another
couple
of
"months,"
you'll
be
historical.
so
only
71
years
best.
the
best
in
71
years.
but
what
we're
doing
has
been
an
incredible
thing.
it's
an
incredible
thing.
when
i'm
on
the
debate
stage
with
one
of
these
"characters,"
and
they
try
and
say
negative
"stuff,"
i'll
just
"say,"
"\"well,"
here's
the
story.
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
this
group
is
doing
the
"best,"
and
that
group
is
doing
the
"best,"
and
the
women
are
doing
the
"best,"
and
everybody's
doing.
and
"frankly,"
you
know
what
it
is?
the
whole
country's
doing
the
best.
okay?
the
whole
country
is
doing
the
"best.\""
so
we
have
records
and
"everything,"
and
yet
they're
trying
"to,"
and
they
really
"are,"
i've
never
seen
anything
like
"it,"
they're
accusing
"me,"
"really,"
of
doing
what
joe
biden
…
biden
admitted
what
he
did.
how
about
this?
they
protect
him.
did
you
see
the
crummy
debate?
those
debates
are
so
boring.
they're
dying
in
the
ratings.
they're
"dying,"
they're
dying.
"\""
while
it's
totally
"unsupported!\""
what's
unsupported?
he's
on
tape
saying
that
he's
holding
back
$1
billion
from
ukraine
unless
you
change
the
prosecutor.
how
about
that
question?
i
won't
say
who
"answered,"
because
you
know
i'm
"not,"
i
actually
used
to
like
the
"guy,"
he
was
a
nice
guy
to
"me,"
but
now
i
don't
like
him
so
"much,"
but
that's
okay.
but
he
"goes,"
"\"while"
it's
totally
"unsubstantiated,"

while
we
beg
your
mercy
that
we're
asking
you
even
to

president

and
sleepy
joe
gives
a
sleepy
"answer,"
and
that's
the
end

that's
it.
then
whenever
i
bring

while
these

are

they
would
bring
the

back.
"no,"
the

"no,"
it's

in

i'd

because
we
have

i
wanted

supported

"overwhelmingly,"

pretty
"simple,"
pretty

pretty

than
any
other
"president,"
by
far.
you're
saving
almost
"$3,000"
a
year
because
of
regulation
cuts.
total
income
gains
for
median
households
will
reach
"$10,000"
a
family.
i'll
give
you
a
couple
of
quick
numbers.
so
under
president
"bush,"
for
eight
"years,"
you
saved
"$450,"
meaning
you
took
in
450
bucks.
"okay,"
fine.
under
president
"obama,"
you
took
in
$975.
under
president
"trump,"
including
the
energy
"savings,"
and
the
regulation
"savings,"
and
the
tax
cut
"savings,"
it's
more
than
"$10,000"
in
less
than
three
years.
pretty
"good,"
right?
so
for
two
"eight-years,"
you
had
a
"400,"
"450,"
and
a
975.
that's
eight
years.
450.
in
less
than
three
"years,"
you
had
more
than
"$10,000."
that
goes
right
into
your
pockets.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
our
economy
is
doing
"well,"
"because,"
as
they
"say,"
the
consumer
is
doing
better
than
they've
ever
done.
and
that's
"great,"
that's
what
we
wanted.
we've
ended
the
war
on
american
"energy,"
and
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
on
planet
earth.
and
these
maniacs
want
to
close
it
up.
how
about
going
to
texas?
you
know
beto?
what?
remember
what
he
"said,"
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
this
guy's
a
loser.
you
know
a
"salesman,"
like
if
you're
a
great
"salesman,"
you
never
talk
that
you're
a
great
salesman.
you
don't
walk
in
and
"say,"
"\"well,"
i'm
a
great
salesman.
i
can
sell
…
"\""
any
guy
that
does
"that,"
they're
no
good.
it's
those
quiet
type
that
get
you.
you
"know,"
the
ones
that
don't
talk.
so
"beto,"
when
he
first
got
"in,"
remember
this
clown?
he
gets
"in,"
"no,"
"no,"
he
gets
in.
"\"i"
was
made
for
this
"job,"
to
run
for
"president.\""
after
about
two
"weeks,"
they
killed
him.
he
was
gone.
but
you
"remember,"
he
was
against
the
"bible,"
he
was
against
"religion,"
he
was
against
"guns,"
and
he
was
against
oil
and
gas.
and
he
comes
from
texas.
i
"said,"
that's
a
platform.
think
of
it.
he's
against
"religion,"
he's
against
"guns,"
and
against
oil
and
gas.
think
of
it.
i
don't
like
to
bring
it
up
because
he's
gone
"zone,"
but
he
comes
from
texas.
i
"said,"
"\"abraham"
lincoln
can't
win
in
texas
with
that
"platform.\""
but
they
"are,"
all
of
"them,"
they
want
to
close
up
your
energy.
it's
a
big
deal.
they
want
to
close
up
your
steel
mills.
they
don't
want
your
steel
mills.
look
at
what
i've
done
for
steel.
i
"mean,"
the
steel
is
back.
we
taxed
all
of
the
dump
steel
coming
in
from
china
and
other
"places,"
and
your
steel
mills
that
are
doing
"great,"
they're
expanding
all
over
the
country.
and
they
were
going
to
be
out
of
business
within
two
years.
the
way
they
were
"going,"
they
were
gone.
united
states
steel
is
spending
now
billions
of
dollars
on
expansions.
every
major
democrat
running
for
president
has
pledged
to
eliminate
gas
powered
automobiles
and
destroy
the
u.s.
auto
industry
forever.
and
you
know
why?
because
they
have
these
maniacs
that
say
you
got
to
go
all
electric.
i
want
to
have
an
"alternative,"
a
big
alternative.
you're
going
to
always
have
the
alternative.
and
a
lot
of
people
don't
know
of
the
electric
can
ever
catch
the
"gas,"
you
know?
and
by
the
"way,"
there'll
be
different
forms
of
energy
coming
along.
but
they
want
to
close
them
"up,"
and
we're
not
closing
them
up.
we're
going
to
have
lots
of
alternatives
so
that
you
can
have
it
from
a
"pricing,"
you
can
have
it
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons.
we're
even
bringing
back
the
old
light
bulb.
you
heard
about
"that,"
right?
the
old
light
"bulb,"
which
is
better.
i
"say,"
"\"why"
do
i
always
look
so
"orange?\""
you
know
why?
because
of
the
new
"light,"
they're
terrible.
you
look
terrible.
they
cost
you
"many,"
many
times
"more,"
like
four
or
five
times
more.
and
you
know
they're
considered
hazardous
waste.
when
a
light
bulb
is
"out,"
you've
got
to
bring
it
to
a
dump.
so
let's
"say,"
over
here
in
battle
"creek,"
where's
your
nearest
dump?
"okay,"
that's
"what,"
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
away.
so
every
time
you
lose
…
drive
a
couple
of
hundred
"miles,"
right?
i
"said,"
"\"how"
many
people
do
"that?\""
nobody.
what
do
they
do?
they
throw
it
in
the
garbage.
but
you
know
what
it
"is,"
because
it's
all
gas.
it's
much
more
"expensive,"
four
or
five
times
more.
and
i
came
into
"office,"
i
did
a
lot
of
this.
"sinks,"
"showers,"
all
of
this
"stuff,"
i
did
a
lot
of
it.
no
water
comes
out.
you
have
areas
where
there's
so
much
"water,"
you
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it.
you
turn
on
the
"shower,"
you're
not
allowed
to
have
any
water
anymore.
i
"mean,"
we
do
a
lot
of
it.
"dishwashers,"
we
did
the
"dishwasher,"
right?
you
press
it.
remember
the
"dishwasher,"
you'd
press
"it,"
"boom,"
there'd
be
like
an
"explosion,"
five
minutes
later
you
open
it
"up,"
the
steam
pours
"out,"
the
dishes.
now
you
press
it
12
"times,"
the
women
tell
"me,"
"\"again.\""
you
"know,"
they
give
you
four
drops
of
"water,"
and
they're
in
places
where
there's
so
much
"water,"
they
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it.
so
we
just
came
out
with
a
reg
on
dishwashers.
we're
going
back
to
the
old.
by
the
"way,"
by
the
time
they
press
it
10
"times,"
you
spend
more
on
"water,"
and
electric.
don't
"forget,"
the
whole
thing
is
worse
because
you're
spending
all
that
money
on
electric.
so
we're
bringing
back
standards
that
are
"great,"
and
better
machinery
that
you
can
have
the
water
"again,"
right?
but
with
the
light
"bulb,"
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
going
on
with
the
light
bulbs?
a
lot
of
people
are
complaining
about
the
"cost.\""
so
i
had
a
couple
of
experts
come
"in,"
i
"said,"
"\"tell"
"me,"
what
gives
a
better
"light?\""
"\"well,"
we
liked
the
old
light
bulb
"better.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
like
it
"better.\""
and
so
what
i
did
is
you
can
have
either
one.
if
you
want
to
buy
the
newer
"kind,"
you
can.
and
if
you
want
to
look
very
handsome
or
beautiful
by
buying
the
older
"kind,"
like
i
do.
so
we're
bringing
back
the
old
light
bulb.
so
it's
a
much
less
"expensive,"
it
probably
gives
a
better
light.
but
whatever
it
"is,"
and
you'll
be
able
to
spend
a
lot
less
money
for
a
light
bulb.
i
"mean,"
it
sounds
like
"little,"
but
it's
big
stuff.
okay?
it's
big
"stuff,"
and
we're
doing
it
with
a
lot
of
other
"things,"
our
dishwashers.
and
you
"know,"
i
won't
tell
you
one
of
the
"things,"
because
every
time
i
tell
"you,"
they
do
a
big
number
on
it.
you
know
the
one
i'm
talking
"about,"
right?
"sinks,"
right?
showers.
and
what
goes
with
a
sink
and
a
shower?
10
"times,"
right?
10
times.
not
"me,"
of
"course,"
not
"me,"
but
"you,"
him.
but
i
never
mention
"that,"
because
one
time
i
mentioned
all
"three,"
i
"said,"
"\"sinks,"
"showers,"
and
"toilets.\""
the
headline
"was,"
"\"trump"
with
the
"toilets,"
"toilets.\""
that's
all
they
want.
they
don't
even
mention
it.
so
i
didn't
mention
"that,"
okay?
i
go
off
the
record.
but
you
know
what?
it's
terrible.
you
want
to
wash
your
"hands,"
you
turn
on
the
"sink,"
no
water
comes
out.
so
you
leave
the
water
going
10
times
as
"long,"
it's
the
same
thing.
you
have
a
"shower,"
drip.
it's
no
good
for
me.
for
me.
you
know
the
one
thing
that
came
out
really
good
about
being
in
this
business?
they
always
used
to
say
i
wore
a
hairpiece.
it's
okay.
i
know
people
wear
hairpieces.
but
they
always
used
to
say.
they
don't
say
that
anymore
because
i
have
been
through
the
worst
storms.
if
you
wear
one
of
those
"suckers,"
you
got
to
give
it
up
fast
because
within
two
weeks
they
got
you.
you
look
"handsome,"
don't
worry
about
it.
but
in
the
last
two
decades
before
my
"election,"
we
lost
one
in
five
auto
manufacturing
jobs
in
this
country.
the
people
are
trying
to
impeach
us
for
doing
all
of
the
things
that
they've
wanted
to
do
for
so
many
years.
and
that's
why
it
doesn't
work.
we
look
so
forward
to
taking
it
"on,"
and
it
is
all
about
cleaning
the
"swamp,"
draining
the
"swamp,"
and
we
have
a
"very,"
very
"big,"
"bad,"
dangerous
swamp.
"okay,"
that's
enough
of
that.
that's
enough.
so
among
the
very
first
acts
that
i
did
was
to
stop
the
deal
that
would
have
dealt
a
death
blow
to
the
u.s.
auto
industry.
i
withdrew
from
the
horrible
trans
pacific
partnership.
that
would
have
ended
your
auto
industry.
a
lot
of
people
don't
know
"that,"
but
i
do.
remember
tpp?
we
were
basically
ceding
our
auto
industry
to
these
countries
that
were
just
going
to
rip
us
off.
the
people
that
made
these
trade
"deals,"
it's
"like,"
where
do
they
come?
like
the
one
in
"korea,"
that
was
a
hillary
clinton
special.
she
"said,"
"\"this"
will
produce
"250,000"
new
"jobs.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
what
"happened?\""
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
she
was
"right.\""
except
it
was
for
south
"korea,"
not
for
us.
"no,"
it's
true.
it
produced
"250,000"
jobs
for
south
korea.
these
deals
were
so
bad.
but
now
they're
getting
really
"good,"
and
some
of
them
are
getting
"great,"
and
over
a
period
of
time
they
are
going
to
be
phenomenal.
wait
till
you
see
the
numbers
that
start
coming
out
of
this
country
over
a
short
period
of
time.
but
we
have
to
go
through
a
little
"pain,"
because
we
have
to
do
"it,"
and
then
they
all
"say,"
"\"we're"
going
to
"withdraw,\""
and
then
i
"say,"
"\"you"
can
"withdraw,"
i
don't
care.
we're
putting
tariffs
on
your
"country.\""
then
they
"say,"
"\"we'd"
love
to
make
a
"deal,"
"sir.\""
the
new
usmca
has
powerful
protections
to
keep
auto
manufacturing
jobs
right
here
in
michigan
where
they
belong.
since
the
"election,"
we've
created
"41,000"
brand
new
motor
vehicle
and
parts
"jobs,"
manufacturing
jobs.
remember
the
statement
by
president
obama?
"\"you'd"
have
to
wave
a
magic
"wand.\""
remember
the
magic
wand?
because
manufacturing
…
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
that
sounds
strange.
what
do
you
do
if
you
don't
have
manufacturing?
how
do
you
make
"things?\""
right?
manufacturing
jobs
won't
happen.
"well,"
we've
got
"600,000"
manufacturing
"jobs,"
and
you're
going
to
see
a
"big,"
big
increase.
the
truth
"is,"
we
need
more
people.
you
know
what?
we
need
more
people.
we
need
more
people
coming
into
the
"country,"
and
they're
going
to
come
"in,"
and
they're
going
to
come
in
through
"merit,"
and
they're
going
to
love
our
"country,"
and
they're
going
to
respect
our
"country,"
and
they're
going
to
work.
we
do
need
more
people.
they're
opening
these
"massive,"
foxconn
in
"wisconsin,"
they're
opening
these
massive
plants
and
it's
hard
to
get
people.
we
want
people
coming
"in,"
but
they
have
to
come
"in,"
only
they
have
to
come
in
through
merit.
fiat-chrysler
recently
announced
a
$4.5
billion
investment
in
"michigan,"
including
the
first
new
auto
plant
in
detroit
in
more
than
a
generation.
and
general

announced
a
$300

right
here
in
michigan.
come
"on,"
general
"motors,"
let's
go.
general
motors
gave
us
a
little
hard
time
with
one
building.
i
wasn't
happy
about
that.
that
was
the
only
building
i
had
a
problem
within
the
whole
car
"industry,"
right?
right?
you
know
the
one
i'm
talking
about.
i
didn't
like
that.
"anyway,"
but
they're
spending
"money,"
you
"know,"
what
can
i
tell
you?
but
these
companies
are
coming
"in,"
a
lot
of
the
foreign
companies
are
coming
because
they
have
to.
i
"say,"
"\"you"
have
"to,"
or
we're
not
trading
with
you
"anymore.\""
because
we
had
such
big
deficits
with
these
countries.
with
"japan,"
we
had
a
$68
billion
deficit.
i
"said,"
"shinzo,"
he's
great
prime
minister
of
japan.
but
he
"said,"
"\"but"
nobody
has
ever
asked
us
to
do
"this.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
asking
"you.\""
they
are
building
"many,"
many
plants.
they're
building
many
plants
now
in
the
united
"states,"
the
japanese.
and
after
years
of
rebuilding
foreign
"nations,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
nation.
is
that
okay?
we
were
surrounded
with
globalists.
you
"know,"
they
think
it's
okay.
you
open
a
plant
in
some
country
that
you
never
heard
"of,"
they
make
your
"product,"
they
send
it.
in
the
"meantime,"
they
close
all
their
factories
here.
we're
not
doing
that
anymore.
those
are
globalists.
they
think
it's
wonderful
to
have
deficits.
i
don't.
they
think
it's
great.
it's
a
great
thing
to
have
deficits.
"no,"
those
are
globalists.
the
globalists
are
passe.
""
our
first
duty
and
our
one
true
allegiance
is
to
"you,"
the
american
"people,"
before
anybody
else.
we
must
care
for
our
own-
we
must
care
for
our
own
citizens
first
democrat
immigration
policies
are
resulting
in
brutal
assaults
and
wicked
murders
against
innocent
americans.
i
don't
even
know
what's
happening.
it's
terrible.
and
we've
moved
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
ms13
thugs
out
of
our
country.
and
we
have
agreements
now
with
"guatemala,"
"honduras,"
el

they
didn't
use
to
take
them
back.
if
we
had
a
"murderer,"
then
we
should
get
them
the
hell
out.
we
don't
really
want
them
in
our
prisons
and
take
care
of
them
for
"50,"
60
years.
we
want
to
bring

they
wouldn't
take
them.
the

used
to
go
around

worked
out

we
stopped
giving

all
the

giving

would
love
to
have
them
"back.\""
we
would
love
it.
it's
wonderful
to
have
them
back.
in
"june,"
two
illegal
aliens
in
"sandusky,"
michigan
were
convicted
of
sadistically
beating
and
stabbing
a
woman
to
death
with
a
kitchen
knife.
"then,"
they
hid
her
body
in
a
water
drain.
a
criminal
alien
with
two
previous
deportations
was
just
arrested
in
michigan
and
convicted
of
brutally
beating
and
strangling
to
"death,"
a
single
mother
of
five
young
children.
it's
happening
all
the
time.
far
left
politicians
support
deadly
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
deliberately
release
"dangerous,"
violent
criminal
aliens
out
of
the
jails
and
directly
onto
your
streets.
we
had
a
great
election
in
north
carolina
"recently,"
two
great
congressmen
got
"elected,"
you
don't
hear
about
"it,"
when
they
"win,"
you
don't
ever
hear
about
"it,"
just
a
few
months
ago.
two
great
people
and
they
got
elected
and
they
got
elected
because
i
went
in
and
"said,"
"\"talk"
about
the
fact
that
you
have
sanctuary
"cities\""
and
they
had
some
horrible
crimes
happening
from
those
sanctuary
cities.
soon
as
i
mentioned
"that,"
"boom,"
they
went
up
like
rocket
ships
and
they
won
their
elections
and
it
was
great.
great
thing.
the
sanctuary
cities
are
a
disaster
and
let
me
tell
"you,"
the
people
of
"california,"
they
don't
like
sanctuary
cities
either.
they're
stuck
with
them
because
they
have
crazy
politicians.
earlier
this
"year,"
authorities
in
the
sanctuary
jurisdiction
of
kent
"county,"
"michigan,"
anybody
know
kent
county?
released
an
illegal
alien
charged
with
assault
with
intent
to
murder
after
he
repeatedly
and
viciously
stabbed
a
man
in
the
head
with
a
broken
bottle.
they
let
him
go
to
roam
free
in
michigan
communities.
if
you
want
to
end
sanctuary
cities
in
"michigan,"
if
you
want
to
protect
your
families
from
criminal
"aliens,"
if
you
want
to
have
a
safe
"life,"
"frankly,"
it's
so
crazy
what
they're
doing.
you
wouldn't
even
believe
it.
you
have
only
one
choice
in
"2020,"
you
must
vote
republican.
thank
you.
i'm
surprised.
as
you
"know,"
you
do
have
sanctuary
cities
in
michigan.
i
was
almost
surprised
to
hear
"it,"
but
you
have
them.
it's
one
of
those
progressive
things?
they
think
they're
doing
a
wonderful
favor
for
the
world.
and
now
we're
getting
these
prosecutors
"that,"
you
murder
"somebody,"
they
give
you
two
"months,"
they
fight
that
you
don't
even
have
to
go
to
jail.
what's
going
on
is
crazy.
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
illegal
crossings
are
down
75%
since
may
and
we've
ended
catch
and
release.
we've
ended
it.
we
could've
ended
it
so
easily.
it's
called
the
loophole.
you
catch
him
and
then
you
release
him
into
a
country.
that's
what
you
had
to
do
by
law.
and
if
you
don't
do
"that,"
they
arrest
the
border
patrol
people.
you
believe
this?
the
border
patrol
people
were
in
more
danger
than
the
criminal
aliens
coming
in
and
some
of
these
people
are
not
good
people.
these
are
the
people
because
"look,"
when
you
have
a
caravan
of
eight
or
"10,000"
"people,"
a
lot
of
those
"people,"
do
you
think
that
"guatemala,"
"honduras,"
el
"salvador,"
do
you
think
they're
sending
us
their
finest?
i
don't
think
so.
alright.
how
about
the
lottery?
that
was
a
schumer
deal.
chuck
"schumer,"
crying
"chuck,"
crying
chuck
schumer.
i
used
to
be
a
big
contributor
to
"him,"
he
used
to
kiss
my
"ass,"
chuck
schumer.
he'd
do
anything.
he
would've
done
anything
for
me.
anything
i
asked
"him,"
get
schumer
on
the
"phone,"
"\"you"
do
"this,"
you
do
that.
you
get
him
on
the
"phone,"
that
son
of
a
"bitch.\""
he
would
have
"done,"
i
didn't
need
"anything,"
but
he
would
have
done
anything.
now
it's
"like,"
"\"the"
prisoner
has
not
"acted-\"."
give
me
a
break.
give
me
a
break.
find
out
how
much
money
did
i
give
a
raise
to
chuck
schumer
and
"chuck,"
give
all
that
money
back
please.
carolyn
"maloney,"
give
that
money
back.
every
penny
should
come
back.
they
act
so
pompous.
they
act
so
righteous.
they're
not
righteous.
they're
not
righteous.
they're
bad
people.
the
far
left
democrats
have
never
been
more
extreme
than
they
are
now.
democrats
are
pushing
a
socialist
takeover
of
healthcare
that
will
take
away
your
coverage
and
take
away
your
doctor.
180
million
people
are
going
to
lose.
a
lot
of
people
here
now
have
healthcare
finally
under
us
that's
phenomenal.
and
that's
what
you
want.
they
want
to
take
it
"away,"
180.
they
want
you
to
go
to
a
hospital
ward
someplace
and
sit
there
all
night.
i
don't
think
so.
not
in
this
group.
and
you
know
what?
some
"people,"
it's
good
so
"people,"
but
can
you
imagine?
they
want
to
take
away
180
million
"people,"
"great,"
"private,"
highly
negotiated
healthcare
where
you
have
your
own
doctor.
remember
obama?
28
"times,"
"\"you"
can
have
your
"doctor,"
you
can
have
your
"plan.\""
didn't
work
out
that
"way,"
did
it?
i
think
we
should
impeach
him
for
that.
let's
impeach
"him,"
for
"that,"
for
the
irs
"scandal,"
for
the
guns.
remember
the
"guns,"
he
was
giving
them
to
anybody
that
wanted
them.
he
gave
guns
to
the
worst
people
in
the
world
and
then
they
didn't
have
them
"registered,"
right?
not
to
good.
impeach
him.
why
didn't
the
republicans
impeach
him?
those
were
"really,"
how
about
giving
around
$1.8
billion
in
cash?
how
about
that?
by
the
"way,"
i
ended
the
iran
nuclear
deal.
i
hope
you
"happy,"
much
different
country.
but
how
about
giving
iran
$1.8
billion
in
cash.
many
big
planes
going
over
to
"iran,"
loaded
up
to
the
ceiling
with
cash.
you
know
what
$1.8
"billion,"
you
ever
see
like
at
a
"casino,"
$1
million
wrapped
up?
it's
a
big
pile
of
"stuff,"
that's
a
million.
now
multiply
"it,"
$1.8
billion
in
cash
he
gave.
"so,"
why
is
he
allow
to
do
that?
did
anybody
try
to
impeach
him
for
that?
everybody
knew
it
was
wrong.
republicans
will
strongly
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions
and
we
will
protect
your
preexisting
physicians.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
right?
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
of
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
and
that's
what
it
is.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
the
american
dream.
and
that's
really
what
it
is.
we're
also
the
party
of
the
great
abraham
lincoln.
a
lot
of
people
forget
"that,"
but
we
have
to
bring
it
up.
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
our
"citizens,"
we
awarded
$100
million
to
improve
water
infrastructure
in
flint.
how
badly
was
flint?
who
were
the
geniuses
that
did
that
to
you?
you
have
clean
water
coming
into
flint.
they
had
to
pay
a
very
tiny
little
fee.
so
"instead,"
they
go
into
this
"horrible,"
"horrible,"
really
polluted
water
and
the
water
comes
out
of
there.
they
spend
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
save
like
a
couple
of
"bucks,"
and
the
water
was
so
terrible
and
it
hurt
the
people.
it
hurt
the
people.
but
we're
getting
it
fixed.
and
i
know
your
previous
governor
was
a
"republican,"
but
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
his.
i
was
"not,"
but
i'm
not
a
big
fan
of
the
one
that
can't
fix
the
potholes
either.
we're
committed
to
ensuring
america
has
the
cleanest
air
in
the
cleanest
water
on
planet
"earth,"
and
that's
what
it's
about.
it's
about
clean
air
and
it's
about
"clean,"
beautiful
water.
and
it's
about
keeping
our
"industry,"
not
closing
it
because
of
the
ridiculous
paris
climate
accord.
how's
paris
doing?
i
don't
think
too
well.
how's
paris
doing
with
the
yellow
vests?
the
yellow
vests?
you
know
why?
because
they
raise
gasoline
prices
so
they
could
send
them
money
all
over
the
world
to
countries
that
the
people
in
france
never
heard
of.
it's
not
working
out
too
well.
we're
lowering
prices.
we're
lowering
taxes.
we're
making
it
possible.
i
"mean,"
look
at
gas
prices
now.
look
at
gas
prices.
i
recognize
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
we
also
recognize
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
big
deal.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized.
"member,"
"\"i"
would
like
to
apologize.
i
would
like
to
"apologize.\""
"nah,"
we
don't
apologize.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
people
of
michigan.
you're
getting
your
auto
industry
back.
at
stake
in
our
present
battle
is
the
survival
of
the
american
nation.
if
you
want
your
children
to
grow
"up,"
a
land
of
"safety,"
it's
"really,"
we
want
a
land
of
"safety,"
justice.
"well,"
i
don't
know.
when
i
look
at
those
fbi
reports
we
got
"out,"
we
got
to
clean
up
a
lot.
what
they've
done
to
hurt
"people,"
what
they've
done
to
hurt
with
comey
and
these
horrible
"people,"
what
they've
done
to
hurt
people.
i
think
one
of
the
best
things
i
did
as
"president,"
a
lot
of
people
would
"say,"
"\"with"
all
what
we've
done
for
the
economy
"and,\""
but
one
of
the
best
things
is
firing
james
comey's
ass
out
of
there.
"boy,"
those
reports
are
kept.
did
you
see
the
other
day?
"\"well,"
"ah,"
"ah.\""
first
time
now
he
"said,"
in
other
"words,"
he's
50%
there
folks.
he's
hit
the
golden
pond.
"anyway,"
so
what
we're
doing
"is,"
we're
doing
things
that
are
going
to
make
our
"victory,"
it's
like
a
tree.
we
need
that
extra
four
years.
we've
done
so
"much,"
even
right
to
try.
you
know
right
to
try?
people
were
"traveling,"
they're
terminally
"ill,"
they're
traveling
all
over
the
world.
we
have
the
best
medical
in
the
"world,"
the
best
"doctors,"
the
best
"labs,"
best
hospital.
they're
traveling
all
over
the
"world,"
to
try
and
"get,"
because
it
takes
years
to
get
something
approved.
and
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute
"folks,"
why
aren't
we
doing
"this?\""
and
they've
been
trying
to
do
it
for
49
years.
they
couldn't
get
it
done.
not
that
easy.
the
drug
companies
didn't
want
the
"liability,"
the
country
didn't
want
the
"liability,"
the
insurance
companies
didn't
want
the
liability.
i
"said,"
"\"here's"
what
we
do.
we'll
sign
an
agreement
with
the
people
where
you're
exculpated
from
all
"liability.\""
"\"huh?"
that's
a
good
"idea.\""
and
it's
a
very
strong
agreement
so
we
can't
get
sued.
but
i
"said,"
"\"listen,"
they
were
worried
they're
going
to
hurt
"people.\""
i
"said,"
"\"these"
people
are
terminally
ill.
they're
terminally
"ill,"
and
so
we
do
it
"now.\""
nine
months
"ago,"
all
the
legislators
at
the
49
"years,"
so
if
somebody's
"sick,"
they
don't
have
to
go
to
"asia,"
they're
have
to
go
to
europe.
or
if
you're
"poor,"
you
go
home
and
you
die.
now
what
happens?
very
simple.
you
sign
that
"document,"
they
work
it
out.
you
wouldn't
believe
how
many
lives
are
being
saved.
it's
incredible.
it's
incredible.
i'm
very
proud
of
"it,"
right
to
try.
i
hope
you
don't
need
it.
you
don't
want
it.
you
don't
want
it.
okay?
but
if
you
"do,"
it's
there.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
of
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
independence
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
the
greatest
trade
deals
ever
made.
they'll
result
in
more
"products,"
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
"phrase,"
made
in
the
usa.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
medicine.
what
we're
doing
is
unbelievable.
we're
so
far
ahead
of
everybody.
what
we've
done
in
the
last
three
years
with
the
fda
and
even
the
speed
of
what
we're
"doing,"
it
would
take
"12,"
"13,"
14
years
to
get
things
approved.
it's
down
to
a
much
smaller
"number,"
but
we're
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
we
are
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
we've
started
the
process.
who
would've
thought
that?
in
10
"years,"
it's
a
10
year
"process,"
we
will
have
ended
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
and
it
could
have
been
been
started
before
i
came
to
office.
it
was
just
wasted
time.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
they're
"incredible,"
and
that
includes
ice.
you
know
how
tough
these
people
are?
these
are
great
patriots.
they
love
our
country.
even
the
sheriffs
alone
"for,"
some
of
the
people
that
they're
dealing
with.
these
guys
walk
into
the
golem's
nest
and
in
some
cases
they
just
swing
it
out.
they
can
have
it.
they
love
it.
these
are
great.
if
we
didn't
have
"them,"
and
i
told
you
"before,"
they're
taking
out
"bad,"
"bad,"
bad
people
by
the
"thousands,"
especially
ms13
gang
members.
who's
going
to
do
that?
who's
going
to
do
that?
anybody
in
the
front
row?
i
don't
know.
what
about
you?
you're
a
tough
guy.
you
might
do
it.
you
could
do
it.
i
don't
know.
you
"might,"
"yeah,"
you
can.
what
you
like?
we're
going
to
recruit
you.
i
think
you
could
handle
yourself.
"now,"
these
are
tough
"people,"
right?
you
got
to
be
tough.
then
they
get
"accused,"
they're
too
tough.
"oh,"
they're
too
tough.
you
have
some
of
these
guys.
they
knife
people.
they
don't
even
need
a
gun
because
it's
more
painful.
they
knife
the
two
young
"girls,"
16
years
old.
beautiful.
they
cut
them
up
into
pieces
because
it
was
more
painful
than
shooting
them.
these
are
animals.
and
then
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
i
shouldn't
use
the
term
animal.
and
by
the
"way,"
she
ought
to
go
home
and
take
care
of
her
district
where
the
homeless
is
all
over
the
place
and
the
tents
and
the
filth
and
the
garbage
is
a
eroding
right
into
the

what's
going

and
it
rains
and
it's
filth
and
it's

and
it's

it's

goes
right
out

we've
just

you
look
at
what's
happened
with
the
tents
all
over
the

are
getting

just
from
walking

they're
getting
sick.

are
coming
back

this

hasn't

it's
a
disgrace.

nonsense.
we
believe
in

dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government

are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
motto
and
it's
always
going
to
be
up
there.
they
want
to
take
everything
down.
they
don't
want
thomas
jefferson
anymore.
they
don't
want
anything.
that's
a
terrible
thing
and
we
fight
for
"it,"
now.
we
fight.
these
words
will
never
be
taken
off.
i
don't
care
where
i
am.
if
i'm
up
"there,"
if
i'm
down
"here,"
i
don't
"know,"
but
we'll
be
fighting.
we'll
never
take
these
words
"off,"
in
god
we
trust.
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
generations
of
michigan
patriots
who
gave
their
"blood,"
sweat
and
tears
for
this
beloved
nation.
this
is
the
state
where
henry
ford
invented
the
assembly
line.
it's
the
place
where
general
"motors,"
chrysler
and
kellogg
transformed
the
nation.
it
gave
us
"motown,"
the
mustang
and
the
might
of
the
american
midwest.
this
is
the
american
mid
west.
and
michigan
is
the
state
where
generations
of
"strong,"
tough
and
proud
american
workers
made
this
into
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
we
are
making
it
"bigger,"
better
and
stronger
than
ever
"before,"
by
far.
loyal
citizens
like
you
help
build
this
country.
and
"together,"
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
you.
the
american
"people,"
the
democrats
took
the
people
of
michigan
for
"granted,"
but
with
"us,"
you
will
never
be
forgotten
again.
the
forgotten
men
and
women
of
this
country
will
"never,"
ever
be
forgotten
again.
and
i'm
fighting
for
you.
and
i
love
doing
it
with
everything
that
i
have.
and
i
will
"never,"
ever
stop.
and
you
know
that.
i
will
say
i
could
have
a
much
easier
life.
some
people
"say,"
"\"why"
is
he
doing
"it?\""
you
know
why
i'm
doing
it
because
we're
doing
the
thing
and
look
what
we're
doing
is
we're
bringing
back
our
country
again.
we're
respected
"again,"
we're
respected
again.
we
are
so
"respected,"
you
don't
even
know
how
respected.
i
went
to
nato
where
we
were
being
ripped
off
because
the
other
"countries,"
you
have
29
"countries,"
and
the
other
countries
weren't
paying
their
bills.
they
were
delinquent
in
real
estate.
i
noticed
people
are
using
that
word.
i've
been
using
it
for
the
last
year.
it's
like
a
real
estate
trend.
that's
when
they
don't
pay
their
"rent,"
right?
"well,"
they
weren't
paying
and
you
have
to
see
this
"chart,"
until
i
got
there.
they
got
to
pay
and
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
does
that
mean
you
won't
protect
"us?\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
don't
want
the
answer
to
that
"question.\""
over
the
"last,"
and
the
secretary
general
"stoltenberg,"
over
the
last
period
of
just
two
"years,"
i
"raised,"
not
from
"us,"
nothing
from
"us,"
$130
"billion,"
but
that's
nothing
and
over
a
short
period
of
time
they
will
be
paying
$530
billion
more.
all
of
those
countries.
my
biggest
fan
in
the
world
is
secretary
general
stoltenberg
of
nato.
he
"says,"
"\"i"
never
thought
this
"could.\""
i'm
telling
"you,"
if
you
"look,"
it's
like
15
years
just
down.
president
obama
would
go
"there,"
make
a
"speech,"
"\"i'd"
like
to
thank
everybody
for
being
here.
thanks.
"look,"
great
job.
sayonara.
"goodbye.\""
"bush,"
they
all
did.
nobody
ever
asked
for
money.
we
were
spending
for
100%
of
nato.
we're
protecting
europe.
they
rip
us
off
on
"trade,"
right?
they
rip
us
off
like
crazy.
we
lose
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
on
trade.
we're
changing
"that,"
but
it's
a
long
time.
it's
been
going
on
a
long
time.
they
don't
take
your
product.
they
don't
take
your
cars.
they
don't
take
your
farm
product.
they
don't
take
your
medical
machines.
we
do
a
big
business.
they
sell
us.
we
don't
sell
them
because
they
put
restrictions.
we
have
better
equipment
than
"them,"
but
they
make
it
so
that
our
equipment
doesn't
qualify.
it's
called
artificial
barriers
or
non-monetary
barriers.
it's
brutal
what
they
do.
i'm
telling
"you,"
they're
as
bad
as
"china,"
just
smaller.
they
are
as
bad
as
"china,"
just
smaller
and
now
china's
doing
great.
we're
very
"happy,"
but
we
have
to
do
something
with
that.
we
have
to
take
care
of
our
people.
we
can't
be
ripped
off
by
these
"countries,"
so
nato
is
ripping
us
off
"militarily,"
but
now
they're
starting
to
pay
big
money
and
that's
good.
we
want
to
help
them.
we
want
to
be
there
with
"them,"
but
they
have
to
pay.
they
have
to
pay.
$530
billion
and
the
fake
news
doesn't
even
want
to
talk
about
it.
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
they
talk
about
other
things.
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
that.
when
you'd
get
a
chance
"though,"
just
a
couple
of
"weeks,"
maybe
you
could
say
over
a
short
period
of
"time,"
nato
countries
will
be
paying
$530
billion
more.
"more,"
not
total.
more.
how's
that?
good.
that's
not
too
bad.
nobody
else
could
do
"that,"
i
guarantee.
i
won't
tell
you
what
took
place
in
those
closed
door
meetings.
some
of
them
don't
like
me.
they
like
obama.
germany
likes
obama.
a
lot
of
these
"countries,"
"france,"
they
like
obama.
it's
embarrassing.
in
"france,"
president
obama
is
more
popular
than
president
trump.
"well,"
i
should
be.
i
just
taxed
their
wine
and
champagne
coming
into
our
country
because
they're
ripping
us
off
on
the
internet.
okay.
if
i
ever
become
more
"popular,"
that
means
i'm
not
doing
my
job.
you
should
say
he's
out.
it's
true.
i
could
be
loved
in
germany.
i
could
be
loved
in
germany.
"oh,"
they'd
love
me.
my
father
came
from

and
i
could
be
loved
in

they'd
like
me
so
"much,"
but
then
i'm
not
doing
my
job
for
you.
have
to
do
it.
have
to
do
it.
with
your
"help,"
your
"devotion,"
your
"drive,"
we're
going
to
keep
on
working.
we're
going
to
keep
on
fighting.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning
because
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
family
and
one
glorious
"nation,"
under
god.
america
is
thriving
like
never
before.
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
"michigan,"
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
great
state.
great
state.
you
better
remember
all
those
jobs
in
a
year
from
"now,"
i
tell
you.
i'll
"say,"
"\"that"
state
let
me
"down.\""
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
happen.
i'm
hearing
very
good
thing.
you
know
the
interesting
"thing,"
before
it
was
like
a
promise.
i
said
i'm
going
to
bring
car
back.
i'm
going
to
bring
this.
i'm
going
to
be
"pres,"
it
was
all
"like,"
it's
good.
you
believed
"me,"
i
was
"successful,"
all
"this,"
but
now
we've
done
it.
we
have
done
more
than
i
"promised,"
no
politics.
i
"promised,"
we've
done
more
than
we
promised.
no
politician
i
"think,"
has
ever
done
that.
together
we
will
make
america
wealthy
again.
we
will
make
america
strong
again.
we
will
make
america
proud
again.
we
will
make
america
safe
again
and
we
will
make
america
great
again.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
michigan.
thank
you.]
[there's
a
lot
of
people.
that's
great.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
very
much.
that's
a
big
group
of
people.
this
is
on
fast
"notice,"
too.
thank
you.
but
i'm
thrilled
to
be
here
with
the
"beautiful,"
"great,"
hardworking
people
of
this
incredible
state.
you're
really
hardworking
american
patriots.
that's
what
you
"are,"
and
a
lot
of
people
haven't
been
treated
right
until
i
came
along.
we've
done
a
lot
of
work
and
a
lot
of
good
"work,"
and
you
had
your
best
year
ever
last
year.
the
state
had
the
best
year
you've
ever
had.
46
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
"minnesota,"
and
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
one
of
the
most
vital
issues
in
this
election
is
the
subject
of
refugees.
you
know
it.
you
know
it
perhaps
better
than
almost
anybody.
lots
of
luck.
you're
having
a
good
time
with
the
refugees.
that's
good.
we
want
to
have
omar.
he
said
omar.
that's
a
beauty.
how
the
hell
did
she
win
the
election?
how
did
she
win?
it's
unbelievable.
every
family
in
minnesota
needs
to
know
about
sleepy
joe
biden's
extreme
plan
to
flood
your
state
with
an
influx
of
refugees
from
"somalia,"
from
other
places
all
over
the
planet.
"well,"
that's
what's
"happened,"
and
you
like
omar
a
"lot,"
don't
you?
biden
has
promised
a
700%
increase
in
the
manifesto
with
"bernie,"
right?
a
700%
increase
in
the
importation
of
refugees
from
the
most
dangerous
places
in
the
"world,"
including
"yemen,"
"syria,"
and
somalia.
"congratulations,"
minnesota.
a
700%
increase.
good
"luck,"
minnesota.
enjoy
"yourselves,"
because
if
i'm
not
"here,"
if
i
don't
"win,"
i
don't
know
where
i'm
going
to
be.
but
maybe
i'll
come
over
to
see
mike.
i'll
come
and
see
mike.
your
state
will
be
overrun
and
"destroyed,"
and
biden
and
the
radical
left
win.
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
i've
been
watching
it
for
years.
they
haven't
treated
you
right.
they
have
not
treated
minnesota
right.
thank
you.
i'll
tell
"you,"
these
hangers
are
great.
remember
this.
it's
a
friendly
protest.
please
remember
this
is
not
a
rally.
you're
not
allowed
to
have
political
rallies
of
any
kind.
you're
not
allowed
to
go
to
church.
you're
not
allowed
to
do
anything.
the
only
thing
you're
allowed
to
do
is
run
wild
through
the
"streets,"
burn
down
"storefronts,"
blow
up
"stores,"
and
kill
"people,"
because
that's
considered
a
"protest,"
and
"that,"
they
allow
you
to
have.
you
don't
have
to
wear
masks
at
protests.
so
i
"said,"
"\"we"
can't
have
a
rally.
the
most
we
can
have
is
ten
people.
but
why
don't
we
just
call
it
a
"protest?\","
because
this
is
a
protest.
it's
a
protest
against
stupidity.
speaking
about
"stupidity,"
sleepy
joe
will
turn
minnesota
into
a
refugee
camp.
think
of
it.
700%
increase.
so
you're
not
happy
now?
look
at
that
guy
over
there.
he's
not
too
thrilled
when
he
hears
this.
700%
increase
is
what
they
have
in
the
manifesto.
"now,"
maybe
they
don't
honor
"it,"
but
i
would
say
they'll
go
substantially
higher
than
that
number.
biden
will
overwhelm
your
children's
"schools,"
overcrowd
their
"classrooms,"
and
inundate
your
hospitals.
that's
what'll
happen.
biden
has
even
pledged
to
terminate
our
travel
ban
to
jihadist
"regions,"
jihadist
regions.
they've
already
been
doing
that
to
"you,"
haven't
they?
opening
the
flood
gates
to
radical
islamic
terrorists.
my
administration's
keeping
"terrorists,"
"extremists,"
and
criminals
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
we
don't
want
them.
we
don't
want
them.
we've
got
enough
of
them.
we've
got
enough
of
them.
just
"today,"
we
"deported,"
as
you
know
very
"well,"
dozens
of
somali
nationals
charged
or
convicted
with
very
grave
"crimes,"
including
"rape,"
"assault,"
"robbery,"
"terrorism,"
and
"murder,"
of
course.
these
hardened
criminals
are
back
in
their
"country,"
where
they
do
all
the
complaining
they
"want,"
and
your
children
are
much
safer
as
a
result.
thank
"you,"
president
trump.
thank
you.
if
it
were
up
to
"biden,"
and
it's
not.
it's
the
people
that's
around
him.
they
are
seriously
radical
left
"democrats,"
and
they're
very
dangerous.
the
offenders
are
very
"dangerous,"
and
they'd
be
running
all
over
your
state.
only
by
voting
for
me
are
you
going
to
say
…
but
i
hate
to
say
"this,"
and
get
it
with
your
iron
ore.
i
did
it
with
some
other
"things,"
and
i'll
do
it
for
you
again.
i'll
do
it
for
you
again.
but
if
you
vote
for
"me,"
i'm
the
"difference,"
and
i'm
the
wall.
you
know
the
wall
that
we're
building
on
the
southern
border?
i'm
your
wall
between
the
american
dream
and
chaos.
joe
biden
is
wholly
owned
and
controlled
by
the
left
wing
mob.
he
has
no
clue
where
he
is.
this
is
not
a
sharp
guy.
years
"ago,"
i
said
to
a
certain
senator
who
i
was
very
friendly
"with,"
a
"democrat,"
"\"who's"
the
dumbest
senator?
who's
the
smartest
"senator?\""
he
gave
me
a
name
for
the
smartest.
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
the
"dumbest?\""
"\"oh,"
joe
biden.
you
didn't
know
"that?\""
that
was
25
years
ago.
that
was
in
prime
time.
this
is
no
longer
prime
time
for
sleepy
joe.
they
do
disinformation.
they
make
things
"up,"
and
they
make
commercials.
they
make
things
up.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
"everything,"
they
make
up.
first
of
"all,"
i'm
the
one
protecting
your
social
security.
they
"say,"
"\"trump\""
…
remember
four
years
"ago,"
they
used
to
"say,"
"\"oh,"
trump
will
get
rid
of
"social\""
…
i
have
protected
your
social
security.
they're
going
to
destroy
your
social
security.
remember?
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
"man,"

did
you
ever?
i
don't
think
that
happened
with

did.
you
realize
rudy's
just
now
really
being
appreciated.
people
forgot
how
good
he
was
as
a
man.
he
was
a
great
mayor.
we
polled
it.
i'd
go
down
about
22
points.
they
want
to
poll
everything
nowadays.
i
don't
believe
in
polls.
they
poll
everything.
but
ali
"velshi,"
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
"guy,"
but
i
know
he
was
standing
there.
this
is
really
quite
a
good
scene.
it's
a
friendly
protest.
everyone's
acting
…
and
behind
"him,"
the
entire
city
was
burning.
it's
one
of
the
great
pictures
of
all
time.
the
entire
city
was
burning
down.
that
was
your
"city,"
and
it's
a
shame
it
took
so
"long,"
but
the
governor
finally
did
it
at
least.
if
you
take
a
look
at
"portland,"
the
governor
can't
quite
do
it.
she
can't
get
there.
i
speak
to
her
all
the
time.
"\"come"
"on,"
governor.
i
can
straighten
out
portland.
give
me
less
than
an
hour.
just
let
us
have
it
"for\""
…
because
the
state
has
to
ask
for
it.
they
have
to
request.
it's
a
shame.
it's
such
a
shame.
but
in
your
"case,"
we
"went,"
and
all
of
a
"sudden,"
it
was
really
…
that
was
going
to
be
a
bad
"night,"
"too,"
right?
remember
"that,"
about
seven
o'clock?
then
you
see
this
guy
walked
out
with
about
a
"$250,000"
outfit
on.
that's
because
it
had
more
computers
and
this
and
that.
got
the
tear
gas
deal.
he's
got
the
whole
"deal,"
pepper
"spray,"
got
"everything,"
the
finest
outfit
you
can
buy.
believe
me.
we
just
paid
for
"them,"
and
they
were
very
expensive.
so
we
see
"one,"
the
helmet.
how
about
the
helmet
with
the
goggles?
you
can
see
at
night.
you
can
see
at
day.
you
can
see
whenever
the
hell
you
want.
so
there's
one.
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
only
one
"guy.\""
then
you
see
another
"three,"
then
four.
then
you
see
another
ten.
they
were
just
getting
out
of
the
"buses,"
coming
from
very
friendly
territory.
he
got
hit
on
the
knee
with
a
canister
of
tear
"gas,"
and
he
went
down.
he
was
down.
"\"my"
"knee,"
my
"knee.\""
nobody
cared.
these
guys
didn't
care.
they
moved
them
"aside,"
and
they
just
walked
right
to
…
it
was
the
most
beautiful
"thing,"
and
that
would
be
it.
but
so
they
had
four
or
five
lines.
then
they
had
lines
of
different
…
everybody
did
the
same
thing.
did
they
ever
even
move
one
step
back?
i
don't
think
"so,"
right?
it
was
just
a
slow
walk
right
forward.
then
they
just
started
walking
"faster,"
"faster,"
"faster,"
put
a
lot
of
guys
in
"jail,"
"tom,"
right?
put
a
lot
of
guys
…
great
"congressman,"
by
the
way.
put
a
lot
of
guys
in
jail.
great.
not
good.
great.
they
put
a
lot
of
guys
in
jail
that
"night,"
"tom,"
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
i
don't
think
he
had
any
problem
after
that.
if
you
had
any
"flare-ups,"
we'll
send
them
in
again.
but
that's
all
you
do.
these
are
democrat-run
disasters.
look
at
chicago.
look
at
portland.
look
at
you
with
minneapolis.
these
are
disasters.
by
the
"way,"
are
they
still
trying
to
get
rid
of
your
police
force
in
minneapolis?
that's
what
i
heard.
"see,"
they
never
learn.
they
never
learn.
they
don't
…
you've
got
a
lot
of
people
here.
that's
a
lot
of
people.
i
actually
like
these.
we
have
the
arenas.
we've
always
filled
them
up.
it's
been
"great,"
and
the
arenas
are
"good,"
but
usually
you
have
to
travel
45
minutes.
this
"thing,"
you
have
a
hangar.
the
plane
becomes
your
"backstop,"
right?
it's
like
your
curtain.
it's
a
curtain.
you
get
a
free
curtain.
we're
"outside,"
which
actually
makes
people
happy.
it
even
makes
the
people
that
sometimes
not
everybody
here
likes
"happy,"
because
outside
is
better.
it's
"better,"
and
we're
rounding
the
turn
on
"covid,"
by
the
way.
our
vaccines
are
coming.
a
lot
of
things
are
happening.
we're
rounding
the
turn.
we've
done
a
great
job.
we've
done
a
phenomenal
job.
we
don't
get
credit
for
"that,"
but
we'll
discuss
that
in
a
minute.
but
when
you
look
at
"it,"
when
you
look
at
"it,"
our
country
is
amazing.
it's
an
amazing
country.
we
love
this
"country,"
and
we're
not
going
to
let
radical
left
socialist/communists
take
over
our
country.
okay?
they
use
the
word
"socialist,"
and
socialists
aren't
great.
but
communists
are
a
hell
of
a
lot
"worse,"
and
that's
where
we'd
be
headed.
we're
standing
in
the
way
of
"them,"
this
group
of
people.
but
you
have
a
lot
of
groups
of
people
just
like
"this,"
every
place
we
go.
last
"night,"
you
know
where
we
were.
you
saw
that
it
was
all
over
the
"place,"
right?
that's
a
big
state.
that's
a
great
state.
then
i
see
the
fake
polls.
i
just
saw
a
poll
"here,"
minnesota.
i'm
down
nine.
i
don't
think
so.
i
"mean,"
i
just
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
"so,"
right?
i
don't
think
so.
it's
the
craziest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
this
is
the
craziest
thing
i've
seen.
president
trump
is
down
nine
in
minnesota.
now
i
just
saw
another
plane.
see
the
plane?
the
good
thing
about
these
beautiful
air
force
"ones,"
right?
that's
the
smaller
version
of
air
force
one.
i
think
you
had
a
little
bit
short
runway.
so
they
take
the
smaller
to
save
about
$12.
"no,"
they
took
the
smaller
one.
but
the
great
thing
about
those
beautiful
"planes,"
they
have
more
televisions
than
any
plane
in
history.
we
have
televisions
in
the
"closet,"
on
the
"ceilings,"
on
the
floors.
i've
never
seen
them
on
the
…
we
have
them
all
over
the
"place,"
and
i'm
just
coming
out.
they
"said,"
"\"there"
he
"is.\""
they
"said,"
"\"it's"
a
smattering
of
"people.\""
they
called
it
a
smattering.
they
always
do
that.
yet
biden
with
the
"circles,"
right?
the
little
circles.
he's
got
like
four
people
in
a
circle.
you
know
why
he
does
the
circles?
because
he
can't
draw
a
crowd.
so
they
put
a
"circle,"
like
he's
supposed
to
…
he's
trying
to
be
legitimate.
he's
going
to
go
by
the
science.
he
always
says
science.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
word
science
is.
so
to
have
these
four
or
five
"circles,"
they
put
"people,"
that
way
he
doesn't
have
to
be
embarrassed
when
he
goes
to
a
high
school
gymnasium
and
he
has
"40,"
50
people.
they
had
one
not
so
long
"ago,"
and
you
saw
this.
he
couldn't
draw
a
crowd.
it
was
a
big
thing.
it
was
his
opening
or
something.
couldn't
draw
a
crowd.
so
they
made
it
a
round
table.
so
he
went
in.
they
only
had
like
32
people.
they
"said,"
"\"this"
is
very
"embarrassing,\""
one
of
his
"people,"
and
that's
what
they
do.
they're
good.
some
of
the
people
surrounding
"him,"
they'll
say
anything
and
do
anything.
they
"said,"
"\"let's"
not
make
it
a
speech.
there's
nobody
here.
let's
make
it
a
round
"table.\""
so
these
people
are
sitting
at
a
table.
they
had
no
"idea,"
and
most
of
them
didn't
know
anything
about
politics.
they
didn't
even
know
why
they
were
there.
now
they're
sitting
on
a
round
"table,"
and
they're
on
television.
but
that's
what
it
is.
but
they
say
we
had
a
smattering
of
people.
"yes,"
smattering
of
about
what?
"15,000"
people
in
about
two
days'
notice.
this
doesn't
include
the
"10,000"
"people,"
"mike,"
that
they
turned
away.
i
hate
that
they
turned
them
away.
you'd
think
with
an
"airport,"
you
wouldn't
have
to
turn
anybody
"away,"
but
they
have
a
certain
amount.
then
sometimes
you
have
democrats
running
an
"airport,"
and
they
don't
like
all
these
people
here.
that's
true.
they
don't
like
it.
but
if
we're
up
to
"biden,"
your
state
would
be
in
ruins.
just
take
a
look
at
what
they've
"done,"
and
i'm
going
to
hit
it
hard.
they
make
phony
commercials
about
"me,"
and
it
gives
me
the
right.
how
about
the
worst
one
of
"all,"
the
worst
i've
ever
seen?
standing
on
a
grave
of
a
fallen
"soldier,"
and
then
they
had
some
"guy,"
a
source
said
…
there's
no
source.
the
source
doesn't
exist.
they
make
it
"up,"
and
then
they
take
it.
it's
called
disinformation.
you're
not
supposed
to
do
that.
i'm
not
even
sure
if
he
knows.
he's
too
weak
to
"understand,"
and
he's
still
weak
to
control
his
people.
but
it
allows
me
to
say
whatever
i
want
about
this
guy.
the
truth
"is,"
he's
not
fit
to
be
your
president.
he's
not
mentally
fit.
if
biden's
"elected,"
"extremists,"
like
representative
ilhan
omar
…
whatever
happened
to
her?
you
had
a
great
writer
who
has
just
made
a
living
off
writing
about
her.
she's
done
so
many
criminal
acts.
isn't
it
damn
disgraceful
that
she
gets
away
with
it?
i
have
to
say
to
"myself,"
i
"say,"
"\"how"
the
hell
did
she
get
away
with
that?
if
we
do
"one\""
…
look
at
general
flynn.
he
didn't
even
lie.
they
said
he
didn't
"lie,"
right?
he's
gone
through
hell.
he's
gone
through
hell.
this
guy
wrote
page
after
page
of
criminal
acts.
"well,"
let's
see
what
happens.
who
the
hell
knows?
but
between
her
and
how
about
aoc?
aoc-
aoc
is
running
a
campaign
against
the
guy
that
was
supposed
to
be
speaker
of
the
house.
right?
joe
crowley.
i
knew
him
a
little
bit.
i
asked
him
once
i
"said,"
"\"are"
you
campaigning
against
this
"maniac?\""
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
she's
just
a
young
girl.
no
"problem.\""
i
called
him
on
election
night.
"nah,"
i
was
going
"to,"
i
was
going
to
"say,"
"\"how"
did
that
work
"out,"
joe?
that
didn't
"work.\""
he
was
going
to
be
speaker
of
the
house.
he's
got
a
certain
talent.
but
you
know
she
had
no
"money,"
nothing.
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
had
"$2,000,000"
and
she
spent
the
"$2,000,000"
all
over
the
place.
her
and
her
boyfriend.
whatever
happened
to
her?
can
you
imagine
if
i'd
do
that?
you
have
to
look
at
that.
she
spent
the
"$2,000,000"
and
big
story.
but
that
was
it.
that's
one
quick
story.
oh
man.
probably
the
guy
who
wrote
the
"story,"
lost
his
job
at
the
new
york
times.
right?
he's
now
"unemployed,"
but
there's
a
big
story.
she
spent
"$2,000,000"
on
bullshit.
if
a
republican
did
that
they'd
be
in
jail.
you
know
that.
it's
a
different
standard
and
it's
a
disgrace.
and
our
guys
better
get
on
the
ball.
"look,"
let
me
tell
you
how
about
yesterday.
they
were
talking
about
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
"again,"
here
we
go
with
the
russia.
there's
never
been
anybody
so
tough
on
russia
with
the
sanctions.
remember
obama
would
send
pillows.
i
sent
tank
busters
right
to
ukraine.
i'm
the
one
that
exposed
the
pipeline
with
germany.
germany
pays
them
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
and
then
we're
supposed
to
protect
germany
from
russia.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
does
that
work?
how
does
that
work?
you're
spending
billions
of
dollars
for
energy
to
"russia.\""
it's
all
okay.
i'm
the
one
that
exposed
it.
what
i've
done
…
"hey,"
they
don't
want
me
to
go.
but
if
you
"look,"
they
don't
want
me
to
win.
russia
doesn't
want
…
maybe
north
korea
does
because
i
actually
have
a
very
good
relationship
with
him.
and
speaking
of
north
korea
and
you
"know,"
it's
okay
to
have
really.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
wars.
we
don't
have
to
lose
our
great
soldiers.
it's
good.
if
i
got
along
with
putin.
somebody
said
"\"he"
gets
along
well
with
"putin.\""
i'm
saying
to
"myself,"
"\"but"
isn't
that
sort
of
a
good
thing?
is
that
"bad.\""
"\"he"
gets
along
with
putin.
that's
a
bad
"thing.\""
but
you
saw
the
head
of
the
fbi
yesterday
started
going
russia.
russia
is
looking
at
our
election.
russia.
here
we
go
again.
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
china?
what
about
north
korea?
what
about
iran?
what
about
…
"\""
they
don't
mention
anybody
else.
the
narrative
seems
to
be
russia.
millions
of
phone
calls
made
not
one
to
russia.
millions
of
phone
calls
received
not
one
to
russia.
then
he
"goes,"
"\"russia,"
"russia.\""
then
they
asked
him
about
antifa.
what
do
you
think
about
antifa?
"\"well,"
it's
an
"ideology.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
it's
not.
it's
a
bunch
of
thugs
and
anarchists
that
are
being
funded
by
somebody
and
find
out
who
the
somebody
"is.\""
it's
unbelievable.
unbelievable
when
you
look
at
this
stuff.
but
"seriously,"
take
a
look
at
the
aoc.
i
call
it
aoc
plus
three.
her
three
people
that
she
tells
what
to
do.
and
"$2,000,000."
"dresses,"
"rent,"
other
things.
you're
not
supposed
to
do
that.
mr.
"congressman,"
are
you
allowed
to
do
that
sir?
you
don't
do
that.
you
don't
buy
dresses
do
you?
if
he
does
that's
the
end
of
his
career
right?
no.
but
it's
terrible.
right
john?
it's
terrible.
will
prosecute
him.
i
"mean,"
why
not?
i
don't
understand
it.
i'll
tell
you
what.
one
friend
of
"mine,"
very
sophisticated
"guy,"
very
successful
guy
called
me
up.
he
"says,"
"\"you"
know.
from
the
day
you
came
down
the
escalator
with
our
great
first
"lady,"
our
future
first
"lady.\""
he
said
"\"from"
that
day
the
people
love
her.
she
gave
a
great
speech
at
the
republican
national
convention
at
the
white
house.
she
gave
a
great
"speech.\""
but
said
"\"from"
the
day
you
came
down
the
escalator
with
our
first
lady.
from
the
single
day
you've
been
under
investigation.
you've
been
under
investigation
by
sleazebags.
people
that
now
we
"caught,"
cleaned
up
their
"phones.\""
you're
not
allowed
to
do
that.
right
mr..
congressman?
my
great
hockey
player.
you're
the
greatest.
right?
but
you're
not
allowed
to
do
that.
you
know?
we
want
their
phones.
"\"oh,"
here
they
are.
"oh,"
by
the
"way,"
they
happen
to
be
totally
"deleted.\""
like
hillary
with
the
"33,000"
emails
she
deleted.
if
she
"is,"
she's
not
getting
her
money
worth.
her
yoga
lessons
and
her
daughter's
wedding.
right?
so
it
was
about
the
wedding
and
the
yoga
lessons.
so
i
"said,"
"\"okay,"
let's
give
her
five
or
six
"each.\""
what
do
you
"think,"
mike?
five
or
six
each.
five
for
the
wedding.
make
it
30.
make
it
a
hundred.
make
it
a
thousand.
a
thousand
for
the
wedding.
and
for
the
"yoga,"
let's
give
her
200.
okay.
what
about
all
those
thousands
and
thousands
of
emails.
probably
classified.
so
congress
…
so
forget
about
it.
let's
assume
they're
gone
because
she
deleted
them
and
then
she
acid
washed
them.
and
then
she
hit
her
phones
with
a
hammer.
i
get
rid
of
phones.
i've
never
hit
him
with
a
hammer.
not
even
as
president.
i
"say,"
"\"yeah."
throw
the
phone
"away.\""
"no,"
no.
i've
never
hit
a
phone.
has
anybody
ever
gotten
rid
of
your
phone
and
taken
a
hammer
and
wiped
the
hell
out
of
it?
i
don't
think
so.
so
she
gets
a
subpoena
from
the
u
s
congress.
not
in
a
lawsuit
against
some
guy
that
hates
you
and
you're
fighting
and
you're
fighting
or
something.
by
the
way
you
do
"that,"
you've
got
problems
in
"court,"
big
problems.
but
she
gets
a
subpoena
from
congress.
u.s.
"subpoena,"
the
most
important
subpoena
you
can
get.
they
get
the
subpoena.
and
after
she
gets
the
"subpoena,"
by
a
few
days
everything
is
deleted.
her
phones
are
busted
up
and
cleaned
and
wiped.
and
everything's
gone.
and
nothing
happens
to
her.
forget
about
what
was
on.
now
think
of
how
angry
it
makes
me
when
i
see
it.
now
how
angry?
could
you
imagine
if
i'd
do
that
it's
a
whole
different
ball
game.
know
how
angry
it
makes
me
when
i
see
it.
and
we
had
an
attorney
general
that
didn't
have
a
clue.
that
was
my
fault.
i
was
loyal
to
somebody.
endorsed
me
early.
you
know
whey
he
endorsed
me?
because
i
went
to
"mobile,"
alabama.
we
had
"55,000"
people
show
up
at
a
stadium.
he
"said,"
"\"i'd"
like
to
endorse
"you.\""
then
after
we
"won,"
he
"said,"
"\"i'd"
love
to
be
attorney
"general.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
don't
think
"so.\""
but
after
four
or
five
times
"asking,"
i'm
a
loyal
person
and
i
did
it.
the
mistakes
sometimes
you
make
is
because
of
"loyalty,"
but
that's
okay.
but
allowed
her
to
get
away
with
that
is
a
disgrace.
maybe
there's
something
they
can
do.
so
forget
about
looking
for
the
emails.
and
they
are
available.
and
i
guarantee
they're
in
the
state
department.
i
guarantee
you
they're
in
the
state
department
that
ought
to
damn
well
find
them.
they're
being
protected
in
the
state
department.
but
forget
about
that.
almost
as
good
is
the
fact
that
you're
not
allowed
to
do
what
she
did
and
her
lawyers
should
"pay,"
kendall
should
"pay,"
equal
consequence.
equal
consequence.
equal.
but
that's
the
way
it
is.
but
we
are
making
a
lot
of
progress
if
you
see
what's
going
on.
i
said
to
"myself,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
stay
uninvolved.
i
don't
have
to.
chief
law
enforcement
"officer,"
can
you
believe
it?
but
i
think
it's
better
if
i
stay
"uninvolved.\""
and
i
have
stayed
uninvolved
and
we
do
have
an
excellent
attorney
general.
bill
barr.
and
i'll
be
"honest,"
he's
a
smart
guy.
i
think
he's
getting
tougher
and
tougher
and
tougher
every
day.
i
think
he's
not
going
to
put
up
with
this
stuff.
i
don't
think.
and
you
know
he's
got
a
lot
of
people
that
are
deep
"staters,"
whatever
you
want
to
call
them.
they
fight
him
at
every
turn.
they
fight
"him,"
fight
"him,"
fight
him.
but
he's
getting
tougher
and
tougher.
i
watched
over
the
last
three
"days,"
i'm
"saying,"
"\"wow,"
that's
sort
of
what
we're
all
waiting
for.
"right?\""
but
she
deletes
her
emails.
aoc
gets
rid
of
"$2,000,"
000.
gets
rid
of
it.
nothing
happens.
nothing
happens.
and
then
she
goes
around
and
calls
us
all
like
what
the
hell
are
we?
and
she
controls
nancy
pelosi.
actually
nancy
pelosi
would
love
to
get
rid
of
her
i
think.
how
about
pelosi?
pelosi
goes
out
and
"says,"
"\"you"
know.
i
think
i
have
my
hair
"done.\""
so
she
goes
out
and
she
goes
into
this
beauty
parlor.
i
told
the
story
in
wisconsin
last
night.
by
the
"way,"
we
had
that
great
crowd
in
wisconsin.
you
have
a
feeling
about
places.
you
know
the
problem
with
minnesota
is
that
i
think
since
"1972,"
this
hasn't
been
won
by
a
republican.
"so,"
you're
a
little
behind
the
eight
ball
when
you
hear
that.
right?
i
"mean,"
i
can
understand.
and
wisconsin
rarely.
but
i
won
wisconsin.
unlike
minnesota
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
very
"much,"
tom.
thank
you.
unlike
minnesota.
but
it's
my
fault.
so
i
had
one
speech
left.
it
started
at
one
in
the
morning.
i
went
to
"michigan,"
we
won
michigan.
that
was
another
one.
great
state.
we
brought
back
so
many
auto
companies
into
michigan.
we
brought
them
back.
but
i
had
one.
it
was
already
voting
day.
it
was
election
day.
because
by
the
time
i
got
there
it
was
just
scheduled.
had
i
made
that
one
damn
stop
to
your
state
we
would
have
won
minnesota.
i
lost
by
what?
a
half
a
point.
half
a
point.
but
i
get
off
the
plane
and
they
"said,"
"\"he's"
in
minnesota.
he's
down
"nine.\""
the
recent
poll.
down
nine.
i
believe
it's
a
suppression
poll.
and
you
"know,"
i
have
an
instinct
about
things
pretty
much.
somebody
said
"\"trump"
has
the
greatest
political
instincts
of
the
last
100
"years.\""
one
of
my
enemies
said
that.
and
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
"don't.\""
i
don't
believe
i
do.
i
think
i
have
lousy
political
"instincts.\""
but
what
am
i
going
to
tell
you?
let
me
just
say
they
said
that.
and
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
statement.
in
"fact,"
i
went
to
my
wife
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
they
say
i
have
the
greatest
political
instincts
in
over
a
hundred
"years.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"but"
i
don't
believe
it.
i
"don't.\""
i
don't
want
to
be
beto.
remember
beto?
"\"i"
was
born
to
run
for
"president.\""
that
was
the
end
of
his
career.
beto
o'rourke
who's
in
charge
of
guns.
by
the
"way,"
he's
going
to
take
your
guns
away.
you
know
"that,"
right?
biden.
sleepy
joe.
sleepy
joe
is
going
to
take
your
guns
away.
remember
beto
on
the
cover
of
a
really
crummy
magazine.
i
won't
mention
the
name.
they've
got
a
lot
of
bad
magazines
out
there.
the
good
news
is
most
of
them
are
dying.
if
not
all
of
them.
but
beto
"o'rourke,"
he
did
the
story
and
he
was
going
to
defeat
ted
cruz.
he
was
going
to
do
all
these
things.
ted
beat
him.
and
i
helped
a
lot
too.
i
was
with
ted
all
the
way.
and
i
think
ted's
appreciated
it.
but
i
even
"said,"
"\"i'm"
putting
ted
cruz
as
one
of
the
people
for
the
supreme
"court.\""
right?
and
you
know
why
i
did
it?
you
know
why
i
did
it?
because
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
had
somebody
on
a
list
we
had
about
45
unbelievable
"people,"
unbelievable.
the
"smartest,"
the
best.
the
absolute
creme
de
la
"creme,"
right?
the
best
minds
in
the
country.
conservative.
they
believe
in
the
constitution.
little
things
like
that.
but
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know.
i
have
to
have
somebody
that
we're
going
to
make
sure
we
get
"approved.\""
and
the
only
one
i
could
think
of
is
"ted,"
because
he's
going
to
get
50
republican
votes
and
he's
going
to
get
50
democrat
votes.
they'll
do
anything
to
get
them
out
of
the
senate.
right?
so
"anyway,"
but
just
to
"finish,"
there's
no
way
that
i'm
nine
points
down.
i
look
at
a
crowd.
so
they
say
"instinct,"
right?
so
i
look
at
a
crowd
and
whether
i
have
good
instinct
or
"not,"
this
is
not
the
crowd
of
somebody
that's
going
to
finish
second
in
the
state
to
a
sleepy
joe.
finish
second
to
a
guy
that
cannot
put
two
sentences
together.
now
it
is
an
ideology.
it
doesn't
matter.
i
could
put
that
broken
piece
of
wood
right
there.
i
could
put
that
out.
and
it's
the
same
thing
as
joe.
it's
just
an
ideology.
it's
just
an
idea.
"now,"
"historically,"
we
have
the
biggest
gap
in
enthusiasm
of
any
campaign
that
they've
ever
opposed.
you
heard
that.
like
36
points.
in
other
"words,"
they've
got
no
enthusiasm
for
him.
i
have
tremendous
enthusiasm
as
we
can
tell.
but
he
does
have
enthusiasm
to
beat
trump.
his
only
enthusiasm
is
put
anybody
in
there.
right?
put
anybody
in
there.
he
does
have
enthusiasm
to
beat
trump.
nothing
for
"him,"
but
to
beat
trump.
okay.
but
historically
that
never
wins.
when
somebody
has
to
rely
on
winning
because
of
somebody
as
opposed
to
winning
because
people
love
"you,"
people
respect
you
…
and
sean
hannity
did
something
the
other
night.
he
said
to
this
"man,"
"\"if"
you
owned
a
mcdonald's
hamburger
stand
in
a
reasonably
busy
"area,"
would
you
have
joe
biden
running
that
"stand?\""
the
answer
is
no.
he
doesn't
have
the
energy.
he
doesn't.
so
he
can't
run
the
country.
"no,"
seriously.
i
thought
it
was
good.
i
never
thought
of
it.
you
wouldn't
have
him
running
your
business.
you
wouldn't
have
him
running
a
mcdonald's.
i
have
to
say
or
a
wendy's.
i
have
a
friend
he
owns
wendy's.
he
always
gets
up.
"ken,"
you
haven't
mentioned
wendy's?
okay.
but
you
know
you
wouldn't
do
it
because
he
couldn't
do
it.
and
yet
he's
running
for
the
presidency.
he's
got
no
energy.
i
made
a
comment
that
somebody
had
low
energy.
that
was
the
end
of
his
political
career.
but
joe's
energy
is
far
lower.
it's
far
lower.
"no,"
it's
far
lower
than
jeb.
jeb
was
on
the
low
side.
but
"joe,"
he's
off
the
scale.
right?
joe's
got
nothing
going.
today
biden
delivered
"remarks,"
"barely,"
to
a
union
after
spending
47
years
giving
their
jobs
to
china
and
foreign
countries
in
exchange
for
campaign
cash.
how
about
his
statement?
"hey,"
we
talk
about
aoc
being
crooked.
she's
a
hundred
percent
crooked.
okay.
but
were
talking
about
that.
look
at
omar.
she
came
in
here.
did
she
marry
her
brother?
where's
that
writer?
that
writer
should
be
given
the
pulitzer
prize.
he
never
will
be.
he
should
be
though.
you
know
the
amazing
"thing,"
all
of
these
"writers,"
new
york
"times,"
washington
"post,"
right?
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
trump.
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
i
had
19
people.
all
brilliant.
all
radical
left.
all
hillary
people.
actually
not
even
a
never
trumper
from
bush.
okay.
all
hillary
clinton
people
"mostly,"
almost
everyone.
they
were
all
democrats.
how
about
this?
you're
being
investigated
by
19
democrats
that
are
smart
people.
okay?
smart
people.
so
my
friend
"says,"
"\"you"
"know,"
you
are
the
most
honest
person
in
the
world.
and
you've
taken
three
years
of
total
"investigation.\""
you
don't
think
they've
gone
over
my
taxes.
they
went
over
at
the
biggest
tax
firm
in
the
country.
the
most
prestigious.
they
went
over
everything.
they
spend
48
million
as
it
comes
out
now.
it's
about
"$48,000,000"
investigating
me
before
i
won
and
after
i
won.
and
we
caught
them
spying
on
my
campaign.
that's
what
they
were
really
doing.
and
now
with
the
"phones,"
i
think
there's
like
22
or
24
people.
you
heard
this
one?
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
no.
we
made
a
mistake
when
we
deleted
our
"phone.\""
you
know
what
they
had
to
do
to
make
that
mistake?
like
19
different
formulas.
right?
i
don't
even
know
how
you
delete
a
phone.
i
didn't
know
you
could
do
it.
but
they
all
made
the
exact
same
mistake.
that's
not
good.
that's
not
good.
so
let's
see
what
happens
to
them.
it's
a
criminal
act
you
know
"that,"
right?
it's
a
criminal
act.
it's
criminal.
weissman's
a
bad
guy.
put
a
lot
of
people
in
jail
that
shouldn't
be
in
"jail,"
weissman.
he's
a
bad
guy.
he's
on
cnn
all
the
time
or
msnbc
which
i
call
it
msdnc.
because
it's
the
same
thing.
owned
by
a
company
called
concast.
did
anyone
ever
hear
…
with
an
"n,"
not
an
m.
con
like
a
con
job.
concast.
they
a
fortune
on
public
relations.
comcast
has
delivered
you
the
"news,"
all
the
news.
and
they
spend
a
fortune.
and
then
i
go
up
and
make
one
speech
and
i
call
them
concast
and
that's
the
end
of
the
pr
for
the
year.
they
are
a
bad
group
of
people.
they're
sick.
i
"mean,"
they're
sick
people.
they're
sick
and
evil
people
and
they
want
bad
things
for
our
country
and
they
don't
report
the
news.
you
"know,"
in
the
old
"days,"
when
you
used
public
airways
"free,"
you
had
to
get
a
license.
i
keep
"saying,"
"\"if"
they're
reporting
fake
"news,"
how
come
they
can
keep
getting
a
"license?\""
whether
it's
"abc,"
whether
it's
"nbc,"
"cbs,"
or
of
"course,"
cnn.
which
is
i
mean
one
of
the
great
jokes
of
all
"time,"
cnn.
or
msdnc.
but
they're
cable
so
i
guess
there's
a
different
standard.
but
when
you're
using
the
public
airwaves
free.
okay?
free.
aren't
you
supposed
to
get
licensed?
so
i
asked
my
people
that.
i
ask
a
couple
of
guys
and
i
never
really
get
an
answer.
i
just
want
to
know
a
simple
question.
do
you
have
to
report
the
truth
when
you
using
free
airwaves
and
making
a
fortune
with
commercials
and
everything
else.
and
i
never
get
the
right
answer
because
there
are
people
down
deep.
it's
crazy.
but
we're
getting
down
to
all
of
it.
a
lot
of
progress
has
been
made.
i
think
you're
starting
to
see
it.
we're
trying
to
beat
a
terrible
group
of
deep
state
people.
you
know
i
came
to
washington
…
think
of
"it,"
think
of
it.
i
came
to
washington
and
i
had
24
years
of
putting
people
in
office.
and
then
you
can
probably
add
another
four
to
that.
and
another
four
to
that.
i
had
"many,"
many
"years,"
decades
of
people
putting
…
so
i
came.
been
to
washington
i
guess
17
times
i
never
stayed
over.
right?
never
slept
over.
i
was
there
17
times.
but
we're
riding
down
the
beautiful
pennsylvania
avenue.
and
i
look
outside
at
those
police.
i
love
our
police.
we've
got
to
treat
our
police
better.
i
had
everything.
i
had
police.
i
had
military.
i
had
soldiers.
i
had
everything
you
could
possibly
have.
you
never
saw
so
much
how
power
and
strength
and
beauty.
the
beauty.
and
they
were
so
proud.
they're
all
"saluting,"
they're
so
proud.
they're
happy
to
have
gotten
rid
of
that
crowd
that
was
there
before
us.
they're
proud.
they're
great.
the
police.
you
"know,"
every
single
police
force
i
think
endorsed
me.
i
got
the
one
yesterday
from
chicago.
that's
not
easy.
chicago
endorsed
me.
new
york's
finest
endorsed
me.
florida.
ohio.
i
"mean,"
everybody.
i
don't
know
that
he's
gotten
one
vote.
then
he
says
he
can't
mention
the
words
law
and
order.
can
you
believe
it?
and
then
i
get
to
the
most
beautiful
house
in
the
world.
i
can
have
mar-a-largo
and
all
of
them.
but
i'll
tell
you
the
white
house
is
still
the
white
"house,"
no
matter
how
you
do
it.
and
i
get
to
this
"gorgeous,"
beautiful
place.
and
i'm
up
at
the
incredible
suite
level
and
there's
abraham
lincoln's
suite.
it's
called
the
lincoln
bedroom.
remember
clinton
used
to
lease
it
out
to
people
for
money.
they
never
change
do
they.
remember
when
barbara
"streisand,"
she's
another
"beauty,"
by
the
way.
but
remember
barbara
streisand
used
to
stay
in
that
suite?
which
was
the
only
problem
i
had
with
it.
but
tell
me
…
"no,"
but
i
do
like
her
voice.
i
do.
i
really
do.
some
of
them
i
don't
like
even
their
voices.
but
she
used
to
stay
there.
and
i'm
standing
in
the
lincoln
bedroom.
the
history
of
the
whole
thing.
the
"bed,"
the
"desk,"
the
gettysburg
"address,"
the
beautiful
four
score
and
seven
years
ago.
this
beautiful
gettysburg
address.
he
wrote
it
there.
and
also
on
his
carriage
ride
up
to
gettysburg.
he
delivered
the
gettysburg
address
and
they
say
the
only
one
that
got
worse
press
than
i
did
was
abraham
lincoln.
did
anyone
ever
hear
that?
and
i
"said,"
"\"no"
way
they
got
worse.
maybe
he
got
bad.
but
no
way
he
gets
"worse.\""
now
people
are
starting
to
"say,"
"\"it's"
probably
true.
i
think
you've
got
the
"worst.\""
now
they
used
to
"say,"
"\"no,"
"no.\""
newt
"gingrich,"
great
guy.
he
"said,"
"\"nope,"
abraham
lincoln
got
the
worst
press.
they
were
worse
to
him
than
anybody.
he
was
a
very
depressed
person.
his
wife
was
very
"depressed.\""
it
was
a
depressed
kind
of
a
thing.
he's
in
a
"war,"
he's
in
a
revolution.
and
he
was
getting
beaten
a
lot
by
robert
e.
lee.
they
want
to
rip
his
statue
down
all
over
the
place.
but
robert
e.
lee
whether
you
like
statues
or
"not,"
they
don't
rip
statues
down
anymore.
i
signed
a
law.
10
years
in
jail
if
they
rip
them
down.
but
robert
e.
lee
won
"many,"
many
battles
in
a
row
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
over
in
one
day.
it
was
supposed
to
end
immediately
because
the
north
was
too
powerful
for
the
south.
but
it
just
shows
when
you
have
"leaders,"
when
you
have
a
great
general.
and
robert
e.
"lee,"
he
would
have
won
except
for
gettysburg.
and
that
was
because
his
general
was
killed
who's
going
to
lead
gettysburg.
never
fight
"uphill,"
me
boys.
never
fight
uphill.
he
heard
they
were
going
up
hill.
stop
"them,"
stop
them.
but
we
had
no
cell
phones
in
that
"day,"
right?
congressmen?
no
cell
phones.
so
they
sent
the
horses
to
stop
him.
stop
him.
but
it
was
too
late.
they
fought
uphill
and
they
got
slaughtered.
that's
what
happened.
but
robert
e.
lee
these
were
incredible
things.
but
i
hope
you
appreciate
that
we
had
a
period
of
time
when
they
were
ripping
down
all
of
the
statues
and
monuments.
and
i
said
to
my
people
four
months
"ago,"
i
"said,"
"\"this"
is
crazy.
these
"people.\""
and
they
don't
even
know.
they
started
ripping
down
abraham
lincoln.
when
they
hit
lincoln
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
this
is
the
man.
and
you
can't
do
"…\""
then
they
hit
george
"washington,"
thomas
jefferson.
they
hit
everybody.
they
even
had
gandhi.
all
gandhi
wanted
was
one
thing.
peace.
may
we
have
peace.
rip
down
the
statue
we
don't
like
it.
i
don't
think
they
have
any
idea
what
they're
doing.
i
think
they're
just
a
bunch
of
thugs.
okay?
you
want
to
know
that?
i
think
they
are
a
bunch
of
thugs.
they
were
going
to
march
on
washington
and
they
were
going
to
rip
down
a
statue
of
abraham
lincoln.
you
know
the
exact
statute.
its
up
very
nicely.
up
now.
and
by
the
"way,"
they
can
take
them
down
legally.
they
go
through
congress
as
a
way
of
doing
it.
but
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
that
way.
and
they
were
marching
on
washington.
and
i
"said,"
"\"do"
we
have
any
laws
about
"this?\""
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
"sir.\""
now
in
"congress,"
the
way
it
is
"now,"
the
most
you
get
is
about
a
$10
fine.
you
rip
down
a
$5
million
statue
and
you
got
a
$10
fine.
right?
it's
different
world.
that's
when
it
was
strong
and
they
had
laws.
but
we
told
and
found
this
old
act.
and
the
old
act
"said,"
if
you
rip
down
a
monument
or
a
"statue,"
you
get
10
years
in
prison.
they
call
it
"prison,"
not
"jail,"
which
sounds
even
worse.
i
"said,"
"\"bring"
that
sucker
up
immediately
to
the
oval
office
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
coming
to
"washington.\""
they
were
going
to
march
on
the
jefferson
memorial.
do
you
believe
that?
the
jefferson
memorial.
we
grow
up
…
the
jefferson
memorial.
they
were
going
to
march
on
the
jefferson
memorial.
they
were
going
to
do
damage
to
our
beautiful
jefferson
memorial
after
thomas
jefferson.
and
i
did
predict
that.
a
friend
of
mine
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
two
years
ago
you
"said,"
next
will
be
robert
e.
lee
and
then
comes
washington.
and
jefferson
and
lincoln.
they'd
never
stop.
the
only
thing
they
understand
is
strength.
remember
"that.\""
they
don't
understand
weakness.
there's
nothing
you
can
do.
these
really
stupid
heads
of
these
corporations
that
give
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars.
it's
like
blackmail
"money,"
right?
but
these
stupid
people
that
"run,"
they
get
"$40,000,000"
a
year
and
they're
weak.
"okay,"
they're
weak.
but
these
"people,"
they're
anarchists
and
the
only
thing
they
understand
is
strength.
so
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
see
this
"document.\""
i
"said,"
"\"wow,"
this
is
a
very
strong
"document.\""
and
derek
is
here.
one
of
my
"attorneys,"
he
did
a
great
job.
i
don't
know
where
the
hell
derek
is.
he's
around
here.
actually
he's
heard
this
before
though.
not
quite.
you're
getting
a
very
unique
speech
tonight.
you
know?
i
mean
unlike
"joe,"
i
haven't
even
looked
at
the
teleprompter.
this
guy
will
"\"move"
it
up.
move
it
up.
i
can't
see.
move
it
"up.\""
i
haven't
looked
at
it.
the
poor
teleprompter
guy
he's
sitting
there
"\"what"
do
we
do?
we're
on
line
two
of
the
"teleprompter.\""
he
"said,"
"\"what"
do
we
"do?\""
"no,"
unlike
"joe,"
i
have
not
looked
at
the
teleprompter.
"oh,"
that
poor
joe.
you
know
what's
the
worst
part
about
him
looking
at
the
teleprompter?
the
worst
part
is
that
means
that
the
fake
news
media
is
giving
him
the
questions.
right?
like
donna
"brazil,"
who
was
brilliantly
hired
by
fox.
fox
has
changed
a
little
bit.
ladies
and
"gentlemen,"
donna
"brazil,"
who
was
fired
by
cnn
because
she
cheated
and
she
gave
crooked
hillary
the
questions
to
the
debate.
how
would
you
like
to
be
me?
they
give
her
questions
to
the
debate.
and
i
still
won
the
debate
and
she
had
all
the
questions.
think
of
it.
how
do
you
do
that?
donna
brazil
"is,"
ladies
and
"gentlemen,"
she's
going
to
work
for
fox.
"oh,"
that's
great.
that's
big
difference.
big
difference
between
four
years
ago
and
now.
a
lot
of
things
have
changed.
but
i'll
tell
you
what's
changed
is
the
fact
that
we
have
more
enthusiasm
now
than
we
did
four
years
ago.
it's
amazing
right?
but
just
to
get
back
to
the
others.
so
i
signed
that
wonderful
executive
order
instituting
this
really
tough
law.
and
it
says
10
years.
it
doesn't
"say,"
you
get
10
"years,"
but
you
can
take
it
down
to
three
weeks.
it
says
10
years.
so
these
guys
had
just
gotten
there.
i
had
a
news
conference
because
i
had
to
let
them
know
about
it.
right?
we've
got
many
people
in
jail
right
now
from
before
nobody
even
talked
about
taking
statues
down.
"no,"
but
i
looked
at
the
andrew
jackson
right?
with
the
ropes.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
the
police
did
a
great
job.
and
mark
meadows
did
a
great
job.
he
"said,"
"\"charge.\""
they
charged.
and
they
took
these
guys
out
and
they
were
fairly
tough.
but
the
police
were
much
tougher.
dc
police.
they
did
a
great
job.
they
were
watching
and
they
weren't
able
to
do
anything.
mark
meadows
said
"\"charge.\""
it
was
like
from
200
years
ago
it
was
crazy.
they
charged
and
they'd
beat
the
hell
out
of
these
guys.
or
you
wouldn't
have
that
great
statue
on
the
horse
of
a
great
general.
he
was
a
great
general.
and
he
was
a
very
good
president.
at
least
a
good
president.
but
he
was
a
great
general.
the
battle
of
new
orleans.
right?
he
went
to
jail
too.
we
had
all
the
evidence
we
needed.
thank
you
for
that.
i
want
to
thank
you
fake
news.
we
called
the
fake
news.
we
said
"\"can"
we
just
have
that
"please?\""
when
they
"said,"
"no,"
we
just
"said,"
"\"we'll"
take
it
off
tivo.
that's
okay.
don't
worry
about
"it.\""
one
of
the
greatest
inventions
in
history.
tivo
better
than
television
because
television
is
useless
without
it.
"so,"
we
signed
it.
and
all
of
a
sudden
these
same
guys
who
were
watching
"it,"
they
left.
nobody
showed
up
the
next
day.
they're
going
to
have
"25,000"
people.
they
had
24
"people,"
5
of
them
were
brought
to
prison.
okay.
and
the
next
day
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
we
were
going
to
save
it
for
saturday
"night.\""
and
saturday
night
nobody
showed
up.
and
nobody
has
showed
up
in
four
months
to
take
down
a
statue.
it's
true.
because
you
know
why?
they
look
and
they
"say,"
"\"i"
want
to
take
down
that
statue.
i'm
going
to
take
down
that
statue.
that
statue's
coming
"down.\""
and
then
somebody
"says,"
"\"you"
know
it's
10
years
in
"jail.\""
they
"go,"
"\"that's"
too
much.
i'm
getting
out
of
"here.\""
it's
true.
ten
years
is
not
"acceptable,"
mike.
right?
ten
years
is
a
lot
to
rip
down
a
"statue,"
have
a
little
"fun,"
especially
when
they
have
no
idea
what
they're
ripping
down.
but
we
have
an
idea
what
they're
ripping
down.
they're
ripping
down
in
many
"cases,"
greatness.
they're
ripping
down
our
past.
they're
ripping
down
our
history.
and
that's
where
these
guys
begin.
they
take
away
your
history.
you
look
at
the
middle
"east,"
you
look
all
over.
look
what
isis
did.
look
what
all
of
them
do.
they
go
down
and
they
rip.
they
go
into
museums
and
they
break
everything
and
they
rip
everything.
they
want
to
take
away
your
past.
they're
not
taking
away
the
past
of
the
united
states
of
america.
not
as
long
as
i'm
here.
what
do
you
want?
do
you
want
me
to
go
back
on
teleprompter
anybody?
okay.
here's
the
question.
my
poor
guy
must
be
having
a
fit.
he's
over
there.
he's
so
good
at
this
stuff.
he's
on
line
three.
…
good
at
this
stuff.
he's
on
line
three.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
should
i
use
turn
the
sucker
off?
would
you
rather
go
teleprompter
or
"freelance?\""
isn't
it
nice
when
you
have
the
option
because
you
have
this
and
you
have
the
option
to
go
either?
"see,"
joe
doesn't
have
the
option.
he
doesn't
have
the
option.
but
if
biden
"wins,"
china
"wins,"
and
it's
very
simple.
it's
very
simple.
by
"contrast,"
i
rescued
the
minnesota
iron
"range,"
i
did
that.
just
so
you
"know,"
o-biden.
i
call
him
"o-biden,"
it's
too
long
to
say
obama
and
"biden,"
so
i
just
"go,"
"o-biden,"
because
i
don't
care
about…
everyone
"said,"
"\"oh"
"no,"
he's
in
trouble.
obama's
now
"campaigning.\""
"hey,"
he
campaigned
last
time
harder
than
hillary.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
want
him
to
campaign
because
he
brings
out
the
"base.\""
he
brings
out
our
base.
and
i'm
only
here
because
of
him
and
joe.
i'm
only
here
because
of
him.
i
could
right
now
be
having
a
very
beautiful
life
of
"luxury,"
and
here
i
am
at
the
hangar
in
minnesota
with
15
or
20
or
"25,000"
people.
and
thousands
of
people
that
couldn't
get
"in,"
and
i'm
working
my
ass
off.
i
could
be
at
home
having
a
good
"time,"
wonderful
time.
but
the
one
thing
i
said
is-
we
want
trump.
we
want
trump.
we
want
trump.
but
i
say
this.
i
say
this
"look,"
i
could
be
home.
so
home
was
new
york.
i
had
to
bail
out
because
it
was
too
"crazy,"
everything
has
fallen
apart.
but
"home,"
it's
so
sad
what
the
democrats
have
done
to
our
great
new
york.
between
a
governor
and
a
"mayor,"
the
crime
is
through
the
"roof,"
the
corruption
is
"incredible,"
it's
a
sad
thing
that's
happened
to
new
york.
hopefully
it'll
come
back
by
somebody.
somebody
will
go
in
there
and
do
like
a
rudy.
you
know
when
rudy
took
"over,"
it
was
so
bad
and
they
were
looking
for
somebody
and
they
thought
he
was
the
guy
because
he
was
a
tough
guy.
but
somebody
has
to
go
in
and
clean
it
up.
this
"mayor,"
he
let
go
of
a
billion
dollars
worth
of
police.
he
actually
believed
the
nonsense
about
defunding
the
police.
and
they're
all
going
to
do
it.
they're
all
going
to
do
it.
and
new
york
people
are
going
to
do
it.
i'm
being
totally
serious
now.
you've
got
to
go
out
and
you've
got
to
vote
for
trump.
you
got
to
break
this
spell
from
1972.
you
saw
kenosha.
what
we
did
for
other
"places,"
you
saw
the
"kenosha,"
and
that
was
gone.
that
was
all
gone.
that
place
was
gone.
we
sent
in
the
"troops,"
it
was
incredible
what
we
"did,"
and
they
did
it
on
day
three.
day
three
is
better
than
two
weeks
"later,"
like
in
minneapolis.
but
they
did
"it,"
and
we've
done
a
great
job
and
the
people
of
that
great
"state,"
they
understand
"it,"
and
i
just
hope
the
people
of
your
state
of
minnesota
understand
it
because
we
don't
have
too
many
more
chances
with
this
stuff.
we
really
don't.
we
don't
have
the
luxury
of
sitting
back
and
"saying,"
"\"let's"
have
four
years
of
this
"maniac,"
vice
president
that
he
picked
who
treated
him
worse
than
any
other
person.
that's
why
i
say
the
one
person
that
he
won't
pick…
my
great
"instincts,"
right?
the
one
person
he
won't
pick
is
kamala
because
she
called
him
a
"racist,"
she
tried
to
me-too
him.
he
was
me-too'd.
"\"i've"
just
been
me-too'd
"darling,"
what
does
that
"mean?\""
but
they
tried
to
me-too
him.
and
she
was
the
one
that
brought
it
up.
remember
tara?
she
was
the
one
that
brought
it
"up,"
and
then
he
"goes,"
"\"ladies"
and
"gentlemen,"
i'd
like
to
pick…
wait
a
"minute,"
let
me
get
her
name
here.
how
do
you
pronounce
it?
it's
with
a
"comma,"
like
a
"comma,"
right?
like
a
"comma.\""
remember
he
couldn't
pronounce
her
name?
he
was
saying
her
name
"wrong,"
and
she
had
to
interrupt
him.
"no,"
my
name
is
kamala.
like
comma.
i
remember
that.
like
a
comma.
"h1n1,"
that's
"right,"
joe.
remember
that
"joe,"
h1n1.
and
how
bad
did
he
do
in
that
though?
how
about
that?
how
bad
did
he
do?
so
come
to
think
of
"it,"
he's
out
there
now
today.
it
was
pathetic.
by
the
"way,"
did
you
see
the
anderson
cooper
thing
last
night?
you
have
to
watch.
i
don't
want
to
"watch,"
but
i
have
an
obligation.
i'm
competing
against
somebody.
you
don't
want
to
compete
and
"say,"
"\"i'm"
not
going
to
watch
my
"competition,"
who
"wouldn't?\""
it's
"boring,"
but
i
got
to
watch.
and
he
got
through
it.
he
met
a
couple
of
really…
the
chicken
thing
was
bad.
he
said
chicken
"many,"
many
"times,"
and
it
was
a
little
strange
that
i
thought
it
was
over
and
he
pulled
it
back.
he
was
able
to
pull
it
back.
but
anderson
is
a…
and
he
interviewed
"me,"
he's
tough.
you
"know,"
he
can
be
"tough,"
nothing
against
him.
he
could
be
very
"tough,"
but
last
night
he
was
in
rare
form.
he
"was,"
"\"thank"
you
very
much
for
being
"here,"
mr.
vice
"president,"
are
you
enjoying
the
"run?\""
and
compare
that
with
my
"shot,"
where
they
asked
me
about
doing
abc
with
george
stephanopoulos.
i
think
it
was
great.
i
think
it
worked
out
great.
you
know
what
i
call
it?
debate
prep.
i
call
that
free
debate
prep.
but
you
know
it's
"nasty,"
it's
a
little
nasty
that
people…
and
i
didn't
"say,"
"\"no,"
you
got
to
change
the
rules.
"no,"
give
me
the
questions.
i
want
to
use
a
teleprompter
to
"answer.\""
how
about
that
though?
mr.
vice
"president,"
i'd
like
to
know
your
feeling
on
nuclear
warfare
and
how
does
that
relate
to
china
and
russia
and
where
are
they
in
the
race?
"well,"
you
can't
have
this
as
your
president.
i
don't
care.
forget
about
me.
you
can't
do
this.
the
importance
and
the
power
of
this
position
are
too
great.
you
can't
do
it.
i've
learned
a
lot
as
president.
but
one
thing
i
learned
is
that
president
xi
of
china
is
sharp.
you
ever
see
him
standing
with
the
two
million
men
walking
in
"front,"
everybody's
the
same
"height,"
they're
wearing
"hats,"
everyone's
like
a
pool
"table,"
right?
and
he's
standing
there
by
"himself,"
and
he's
looking
like
he's
not
playing
games.
there's
no
"games,"
he's
sharp
as
you
can
be.
and
i
had
a
great
"relationship,"
but
now
i
feel
differently.
we
made
a
great
trade
"deal,"
and
now
i
feel
differently.
but
he's
a
sharp
as
you
can
be.
putin
as
sharp
as
you
can
be.
kim
jong
"un,"
we
would
have
been
in
a
war
with
north
korea
100%.
i
asked
"obama,"
"\"did"
you
ever
call
"him?\""
he
said
that
was
the
toughest
problem
we
had.
and
we
get
along.
remember
about
a
month
"ago,"
two
months
"ago,"
they
broke
into
the
demilitarized
zone
and
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
he's
going
to
"attack.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
he's
not.
don't
worry
about
"it.\""
i
got
to
know
him
very
well.
we
have
a
good
relationship.
people
"said,"
"\"he"
has
a
good
relationship
with
kim
jong
"un,"
that's
"terrible.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
that's
"good.\""
but
you
remember
it
was
going
to
be
a
nuclear
"war,"
and
i
got
along
with
him.
then
they
"said,"
"\"trump"
made
a
terrible
deal.
he's
given
so
much
to
north
"korea.\""
what
did
i
give?
i
was
at
like
a
semi
debate
with
his
"idiot,"
a
reporter.
"\"he's"
given
a
lot
to
north
"korea.\""
"\"what"
did
i
"give?\""
"\"i"
don't
"know.\""
"sanctions,"
sanctions.
you
took
away.
"no,"
i
didn't.
"actually,"
i
increased
the
sanctions
very
substantially.
what
did
you
give?
what
did
i
give?
tell
me.
so
after
about
four
days
they
couldn't
ask
because
i
gave
nothing
except
i
gave
heart
because
i
don't
want
to
see
people
killed
on
their
side
either.
i
don't
want
to
see
people
killed.
we'd
win
that.
we'd
win
them
all.
we
have
the
greatest
weapons
right
now
ever
conceived
by
man.
we've
rebuilt
our
military
to
a
level
that
nobody
ever
thought
possible.
and
then
the
fake
news.
and
i
said
that
a
couple
of
weeks
"ago,"
remember
i
"said,"
"\"we"
have
created
the
most
powerful
weapons
known
to
"man.\""
it's
true.
we
have
weapons
that
are
so
advanced
that
president
"xi,"
"putin,"
"everybody,"
we're
the
envy
of
the
world.
but
they
don't
know
quite
what
we
"have,"
but
they
know
we
have
stuff
that
they
never
even
heard
of
before.
and
some
schmuck
back
there
"said,"
"\"i"
think
he's
given
away
classified
"information.\""
"now,"
all
i'm
doing
is
telling
the
"world,"
we
have
the
most
powerful
weapons
in
the
world.
i'm
not
even
saying
what
kind.
you
don't
even
want
to
know
about
it.
and
god
help
us
if
we
ever
have
to
use
them.
but
we
have
the
most
powerful
weapons
ever
conceived
by
man.
they
have
the
"missile,"
the
"super-duper,"
hydro
"sonic,"
i
call
it
the
"super-duper,"
it
goes
five
times
faster
than
a
normal
"missile,"
right?
we
have
one
goes
much
faster
than
that.
but
russia
got
that
information
from
the
obama
administration.
russia
stole
that
information.
you
knew
that.
russia
got
the
information
and
they
built
it.
but
we
have
now
one
that's
much
faster
than
that.
that's
like
a
slow
missile.
that's
like
considered
a
slow
missile.
but
i
said
it
was
incredible.
two
weeks
ago
i
"said,"
"\"we"
have
the
"finest,"
the
"best,"
the
most
"incredible,"
"sadly,"
the
most
"deadly,"
and
we
never
want
to
use
"it,"
but
we
have
the
greatest
weapons
ever
in
history
by
a
factor
of
"10,"
by
a
factor
of
"10.\""
and
they
went
crazy.
"\"he's"
given
away
"classified.\""
these
people
are
sick.
all
i'm
doing
is
saying
that
we
rebuilt
our
military
$2.5
trillion
all
built
in
the
"usa,"
every
single
ounce
of
it.
we
have
fighter
"jet,"
f-35
that
are
so
"good,"
you
can't
see
it.
and
i
went
to
see
the
"program,"
and
i
met
some
of
the
pilots
and
these
guys
are
better
looking
than
tom
cruise.
they're
tougher.
they're
stronger.
they're
bigger.
they're
more
powerful.
they're
smarter.
and
i
like
tom
cruise
by
the
"way,"
because
you
can't
get
much
better
than
top
"gun,"
right?
great
movie.
you
can't
get
better.
i
like
tom
cruise.
but
these
guys
are
better
looking
than
tom.
they
got
that
crew
"cut,"
they
got
the
crap
under
their
"eyes,"
they
got
the
whole
deal.
they're
smart
as
hell.
so
i
"said,"
"\"so"
"captain,"
let
me
ask
"you,"
how
good
is
the
"f-35?\""
"\"they're"
really
good
"sir,"
best
plane
we've
ever
had
all
"great.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
do
you
compare
that
with
what
russia
"has?\""
"\"well,"
ours
is
better
for
a
specific
"reason,"
sir.
you
can't
see
"it.\""
"\"what"
does
that
"mean?\""
"\"well,"
when
we
"fight,"
they
cannot
see
"us,"
that
we
are
so
"stealth.\""
now
that
doesn't
mean
in
three
years
that
it
won't
be
obsolete
because
that's
what
happens.
that's
the
problem
with
that
business.
you
come
up
with
a
new
computer
and
two
weeks
later
it's
obsolete.
that's
why
i
always
like
real
"estate,"
and
grab
a
piece
of
real
estate.
but
"no,"
it's
true.
i
wouldn't
be
good
in
that
business.
you
get
to
"work,"
"work,"
"work,"
and
then
you're
starting
the
next
one
because
the
last
one
is
gone.
that's
why
i
always
talk
about
walls
and
wheels.
when
the
democrats
were
"saying,"
"\"walls"
are
old
"fashioned.\""
"well,"
they're
right
about
that.
but
they
work.
remember
that?
all
we
had
to
go
through
in
congress?
and
that
wall
is
going
"up,"
think
of
that.
we're
building
10
miles
a
"week,"
10
miles
a
week
of
the
top.
and
our
numbers
on
the
border
are
the
best
they've
ever
been.
the
best
they've
ever
been.
"well,"
we're
building
10
miles
of
wall
a
week.
we're
up
to
about
330
"miles,"
and
we'll
have
it
finished
very
"soon,"
and
it's
having
a
tremendous
impact
on
drugs.
it's
having
a
tremendous
impact
on
all
of
the
different
things.
human
trafficking
in
women.
it's
not
even
children.
they're
trafficking
"women,"
it's
because
of
the
internet.
you
think
of
that
as
almost
an
ancient
kind
of
a
"crime,"
right?
but
it's
not.
it's
a
very
modern
crime
and
it's
an
unbelievably
profitable
crime.
they're
trafficking
"women,"
little
bit
"children,"
but
mostly
women.
where
they'll
put
three
or
four
women
in
the
back
in
the
trunk
of
a
car
and
they'll
go
through
the
border.
they
can't
do
it
anymore.
and
we're
catching
them.
we
have
people
that
do
nothing
but
look
for
the
traffickers.
to
"me,"
the
traffickers
are
the
biggest
scum
of
the
world.
and
thank
heavens
for
"ice,"
and
thank
heavens
for
border
patrol
because
these
people
do
a
job
that
you
don't
want.
i
know
mike
doesn't
want
it.
you
wouldn't
even
be
good
at
"it,"
"mike,"
he'll
do
a
commercial
about
it.
that's
what
he'll
do.
does
he
have
the
longest
commercials
in
history?
i
"say,"
mike
lindell.
i
"say,"
"mike,"
the
pillow
man.
i
"say,"
mike
is
the
single
greatest
purchaser
of
commercials
in
history.
i
want
him
to
buy
my
commercials.
i
"say,"
"\"you"
"know,"
we
spent
$20
"million,"
i
sell
like
two
"commercials.\""
he
spends
$2
and
he's
got
the
whole
day
on
fox.
i
"said,"
let
mike
buy
our
commercials.
will
you?
i
don't
know
what
the
hell
you
"do,"
but
whatever
it
"is,"
you
better
tell
me
the
secret.
greatest
purchaser
of
commercials.
but
we
have
done
some
job
with
that.
and
the
traffickers
and
drugs
are
way
down.
now
we
got
upset
with
the
"pandemic,"
but
i
watched
biden
today
talking
"about,"
"\"if"
only
trump
moved
one
week
sooner.
one
"week.\""
so
let's
"go,"
ready?
"so,"
you
know
he
was
against
the
"ban,"
right?
because
he
didn't
think
we
had
a
problem.
so
he
was
against
the
ban.
he
didn't
know
that
china
was
heavily
infected.
he
doesn't
even
know
where
china
"is,"
in
my
opinion.
but
he
was
against
the
ban.
these
guys
write
stuff
out
for
"him,"
and
he
tries
to
read
it.
doesn't
do
well
with
it.
so
he
was
against
"it,"
but
now
his
new
thing
"is,"
if
only
i
moved
one
week
"earlier,"
but
i
was
earlier
than
everybody.
if
you
think
about
it.
i
had
nice
"guy,"
dr.
"fauci,"
i
had
another
"nice,"
got
a
lot
of
doctors.
they
were
all
telling
"me,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
you
don't
have
to
do
"that.\""
tom
knows
that
very
well.
"\"you"
don't
have
to
do
"that,"
sir.
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
you
don't
have
to
do
that
at
"all.\""
and
one
of
those
"things,"
i
was
very
early
and
i
banned
and
everybody
admits
that
had
i
not
banned
highly
infected
wuhan
"province,"
right?
highly
"infected,"
we
would
have
had
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
deaths.
and
then
you
had
the
chart.
i
put
it
up
"yesterday,"
i'm
doing
these
news
conferences.
we're
finally
getting
the
word
across
that
we
did
a
great
"job,"
but
i'm
doing
news
conferences
now
every
day.
i
call
them
the
highly
rated
news
conferences.
and
i
go
before
these
crazy
"people,"
they're
screaming
like
maniacs.
it's
not
the
way
they
treat
sleepy
joe.
he'd
melt.
if
they
ever
did
a
number
"on,"
this
guy
would
be
there
he'd
be
laying
on
the
floor
"crying,"
"\"get"
me
out
of
"here,"
darling.
where
is
my
wife?
get
me
out
of
"here,"
"please,"
darling.
they're
so
nasty
to
me
today.
what
"happened?\""
we
go
through
it
every
single
day.
but
you
think
about
"it,"
and
he
"said,"
"\"if"
only
trump
moved
"faster,\""
but
he's
the
one
that
two
months
later
called
me
"xenophobic,"
and
he
called
me
a
racist
because
i
was
banning
"china,"
which
was
heavily
infected.
and
then
he
"said,"
"\"don't"
ban
"europe.\""
"well,"
i
looked
at
"italy,"
big
problem.
i
love
italy.
i
love
the
people
of
"italy,"
but
they
were
heavily
infected.
"france,"
i
looked
at
"france,"
i
looked
at
"spain,"
they
even
had
spikes
recently.
did
you
see?
and
we're
doing
great.
we're
rounding
it
with
or
"without,"
but
we're
going
to
have
"with,"
but
you
"know,"
with
his
"better,"
but
with
or
"without,"
we're
rounding
that
"corner,"
and
we're
rounding
it
fast
and
they
don't
want
to
give
us
any
credit
because
they
want
to
keep
this
up
'til
november
4th.
and
on
november
"4th,"
the
press
will
probably
"say,"
let's
say
something
stupid
happened.
the
press
will
"say,"
"\"i"
got
to
admit
he
did
a
damn
good
"job.\""
and
the
other
clown
will
be
in
office.
we
did
a
thing
called
price
transparency.
i
signed
it.
it's
"effective,"
also
very
complicated.
it's
on
your
medical.
and
we
did
price
transparency.
it's
the
biggest
thing.
it's
bigger
than
healthcare.
where
you
see
your
prices.
you
can
go
now
to
"hospitals,"
you
can
price
"operations,"
you
can
price
everything.
it's
a
massive
thing.
the
man
who
did
it…
and
i
took
a
lot
of
"heat,"
and
i'm
doing
favorite
nations
"drugs,"
meaning
whatever
the
lowest
in
the
world
"is,"
we
have
to
pay
the
same.
that's
the
good
news.
the
bad
news
is
the
drug
"companies,"
the
doctors
everybody's
angry
at
me.
actually
under
price
"transparency,"
the
good
hospitals
and
the
good
doctors
benefit
"tremendously,"
but
the
bad
ones
"don't,"
and
you
have
price
transparency.
and
it
goes
into
effect
on
january
1st.
could
you
imagine
if
this
sleepy
guy
gets
in
and
they
say
"like,"
"february,"
"march,"
april
something.
they
say
unbelievable
what
happened
to
"prices,"
it's
dropping
like
crazy.
and
they'll
"say,"
what
a
job
he's
doing
this
president?
and
i'm
the
one
that
signed
it.
i
"said,"
could
you
put
it
into
effect
but
statutorily?
it
has
to
"mature,"
"mature,"
mature.
so
the
earliest
i
could
get
is
january
1st.
it's
like
crazy.
you
know
another
one?
i'll
give
you
another
one.
i'll
give
you
another
one.
so
air
force
"one,"
so
that's
the
"757,"
but
they
have
a
"747,"
which
is
the
big
air
force
one.
i
think
that
just
disrespected
the
people
of
minnesota
"today,"
they
gave
us
the
little
one.
"no,"
actually
it's
because
of
the
runway.
in
"fact,"
when
we
"landed,"
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
a
very
short
"runway,"
could
you
please
hold
on?
i
"said,"
"\"i"
trust
these
"pilots.\""
by
the
"way,"
these
pilots
are
the
best
pilots.
when
you
fly
the
president
of
the
united
states.
wait
a
"minute,"
he's
waving
from
the
window.
when
you
fly
the
president
of
the
united
"states,"
you
are
the
best
flyer.
they
take
the
best
air
force
"guys,"
they
take
the
best
marines
in
the
"helicopters,"
marine
one.
but
when
you're
flying
these
"planes,"
you
can
land
that
"sucker,"
you
have
no
problem.
there's
"no,"
mishits.
there's
"no,"
"\"let's"
go
around.
i
can't
quite
make
"it,"
"sir.\""
these
guys
are
phenomenal.
you've
got
to
see
what
they
look
like.
everyone's
in
perfect
shape.
i
look
at
"him,"
central
"casting,"
every
one
of
them
they're
great.
thank
you
fellas.
thank
you.
but
i'll
tell
you
a
little
story.
so
air
force
one
is
a
very
old
plane.
it's
"beautiful,"
but
it's
an
old
"747,"
right?
it's
31
years
old
and
other
people
didn't
want
to
do
"it,"
but
it
was
time
to
get
a
new
one.
it
was
time.
you
got
to
get
a
new
plane.
and
actually
air
force
"one,"
i'll
give
you
a
little
"secret,"
it's
actually
two
planes.
they
get
two.
it's
a
hell
of
a
way
to
travel.
if
one's
not
working
"perfect,"
you
use
the
other
one.
but
they
get
two.
so
air
force
"one,"
they
negotiated
a
price
and
they
had
it
down
for
$5.7
"billion,"
that
was
not
sounds
"expensive,"
and
it's
"ridiculous,"
but
that
was
done
by
the
obama
administration.
it
was
done
by
the
obama
administration.
and
that's
okay.
but
no
administration
"obama,"
"bush,"
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
because
it
sounds
luxury.
but
at
some
point
you
got
to
buy
a
plane
for
the
country.
and
these
arab
countries
would
have
their
beautiful
"747,"
"800s,"
900s
pour
"in,"
and
they
were
gorgeous.
and
believe
it
or
"not,"
the
new
plane
is
a
much
bigger
plane.
much
bigger
"wingspan,"
it's
a
much
more
beautiful
"plane,"
it's
modern.
i
think
of
a
31
years
"old,"
air
force
one
is
31
years
"old,"
the
main
air
force
"one,"
not
this.
this
is
a
great
"plane,"
but
the
big
one
31
years
old.
so
you're
representing
the
"country,"
but
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
because
it
shows
luxury
for
two
"planes,"
in
all
fairness.
now
it's
very
"technical,"
there's
a
lot
of
stuff.
i
won't
talk
about
it
because
i
don't
want
to
give
away
any
classified
information.
just
trust
"me,"
some
more
sophisticated
sucker
you've
ever
seen
in
your
life.
i
think
you're
getting
into
a
plane
that
cost
5.7
billion.
right?
but
it's
the
most
"sophisticated,"
two
planes.
so
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
is
it?
a
general
"came,"
and
an
air
force
"general,"
great
"guy,"
handsome
guy.
they're
all
so
good
looking
these
people.
i
"said,"
"\"so"
"general,"
what
are
we
paying?
what's
the
"price?\""
"\""
"sir,"
it's
$5.7
million
and
we're
ready
to
"go,"
"sir,"
could
you
sign
"it?\""
it
sounds
like
a
lot
of
money
to
"me,"
"general,"
5.7
million
for
two
airplanes.
can
we
get
a
better
"price?\""
"\"no,"
sir.
this
was
negotiated
by
the
obama
administration.
the
obama
administration.
this
was
"negotiated,"
"sir,"
by
barack
hussein
"obama.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
good.
it
sounds
very
high.
so
here's
what
i'm
going
to
do.
tell
boeing
we're
not
taking
the
plane.
we
have
no
interest
"in,"
it's
too
"much.\""
this
is
what
i
did.
by
the
"way,"
this
is
one
of
many
stories.
isn't
this
better
than
going
and
"saying,"
"\"i"
saved
your
iron
"range?\""
and
i
"say,"
"\"but"
please
remember
i
did
this
"too.\""
and
i
can
do
away
with
this
"stuff,"
but
i
did
this
too.
please
remember
that
because
i
have
all
this
list
of
incredible
things
i've
done
for
"minnesota,"
i
won't
even
touch
it
because
frankly
i'm
tired
of
repeating
what
i've
done
for
all
these
different
states.
i
"mean,"
i
did
all
this
stuff
and
then
i
hear
i'm
nine
down.
i
don't
believe
it
by
the
"way,"
suppression.
so
i
said
to
the
"general,"
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
5.7
"billion,"
not
"million,"
billion.
that
sounds
very
high
to
me
general.
i
bought
a
lot
of
planes
in
my
life
and
a
lot
of
helicopters.
i
know
a
lot
about
it.
how
could
it
be
"five?\""
"\"sir,"
that's
the
best
price
they
could
get.
we
only
have
one
day
to
do
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"cancel"
it
general.
cancel
the
"order.\""
it
was
signed
actually.
"\"yes,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"do"
you
have
the
right
to
cancel
"it?\""
"\"yes,"
sir.
i
"do.\""
we
negotiated
a
great
deal.
i
"said,"
"\"oh"
good.
cancel
"it.\""
"\"yes,"
sir.
i'm
pleased
to
tell
you
"something,"
sir.
we
have
a
breakup
fee.
we
made
a
great
"deal,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
did?
"oh,"
you
have
a
breakup
fee.
you
mean
you
can't
just
cancel
it
for
nothing?
then
cancel
it.
you
don't
have
to
pay
a
breakup
fee.
i
know
about
breakup
"fees.\""
"\"no,"
"sir,"
we
have
a
breakup
"fee.\""
"\"okay."
how
much
is
"it?\""
"\"sir,"
we
can
break
it
up
for
$250
"million.\""
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
so
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
to
cancel
the
order
costs
$250
"million?\""
in
other
"words,"
we
give
them
$250
"million,"
we
get
nothing.
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
don't
cancel
the
order.
just
tell
him
i'm
very
"unhappy.\""
this
is
what
these
guys.
they're
good
"businessmen,"
by
the
way.
these
"guys,"
right
"here,"
"mike,"
they
might
be
better
than
you.
i
don't
even
know.
he
may
be
the
next
governor.
mike
"landell,"
maybe
you
should
run.
you
should
run.
he
is
my
complete
and
total
investment.
you
should
run.
he'd
be
a
hell
of
a
governor.
at
"least,"
you
know
one
thing.
minnesota
would
be
well
promoted.
"mike,"
run
for
"governor,"
please.
so
he
"says,"
"\"it's"
$250
million.
it's
"250,"
"sir,"
i'm
so
proud
of
"that.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
may
be
"proud,"
but
i'm
"not.\""
so
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
don't
give
them
notice
because
i
don't
want
to
write
a
check
for
250
and
getting
nothing.
i
don't
think
i
could
explain
that
to
the
american
public.
so
tell
them
you're
really
"unhappy,"
we're
not
going
to
make
the
"deal,"
but
just
do
it
"verbally.\""
"and,"
"\"yes,"
"sir.\""
and
then
i
spoke
to
the
head
of
"boeing,"
a
very
nice
guy.
they
had
some
rough
times
since
then.
they
had
a
couple
of
really
bad
things
happen.
"terrible,"
really
terrible.
this
was
early
on
before
the
problems
that
they
had.
but
he
"is,"
he's
a
high
quality
guy.
and
i
said
to
"him,"
"\"dennis,"
we
have
to
start
it
with
a…
it's
got
to
have
a
three
on
the
front
of
"it.\""
what
do
i
know?
i
just
know
that
if
they're
"5.7,"
and
if
i
do
something
with
a
three.
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
can
bring
it
down
to
5.5
"billion.\""
so
i
"say,"
"\"well,"
that's
not
bad.
i
save
$200
million
in
about
a
minute
and
a
half
phone
call.
so
so
far
i'm
not
"good,"
but
it's
not
good
enough.
i'm
not
"happy.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
got
to
really
think
about
canceling
"it.\""
and
i
can't
go
to
"airbus,"
which
is
made
in
europe.
it's
a
little
"hard,"
i
got
to
go
to
their
competitor.
i
can't
say
i'm
going
to
buy
the
air
force
one
from
a
european
company
that
doesn't
work
too
well.
my
only
option
was
to
"say,"
"\"look,"
i
just
don't
want
to
just
put
it
"aside.\""
he
calls
me
up
a
few
days
later.
"\"well,"
we
can
do
a
little
bit
better
than
"that.\""
i
"said,"
"\"dennis,"
has
to
have
a
three
in
front
of
"it,"
"dennis.\""
got
to
have
a
three.
like
a
"three,"
three
"anything,"
but
got
to
have
a
three
in
front
of
it.
so
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"no.\""
after
one
"month,"
we
signed
a
contract
for
$3.9
billion.
same
exact
one.
actually
slightly
"better,"
we
got
an
extra
generator.
and
then
boeing
came
to
"me,"
and
i
love
to
negotiate.
i
do.
got
that
from
my
father.
my
father
was
a
good
negotiator
and
i
love
to
negotiate.
so
they
came
to
"me,"
"\"sir,"
we
can
put
an
extra
"stairway.\""
this
is
the
big
747.
and
remember
this
is
a
"big,"
much
bigger
than
the
old
747.
"\"sir,"
it
gets
very
windy
up
there.
i
noticed
that
your
hair's
blown
all
over
the
place.
but
we
can
buy
a
stairwell
for
the
plane.
and
it
comes
"under,"
it's
like
a
corkscrew
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
"plane.\""
you're
very
high
off
the
"ground,"
"big,"
big
thing.
"\"and"
it
opens
"up,"
and
if
it's
raining
or
"windy,"
you're
"covered,"
"sir,"
because
it's
under
the
plane.
you're
totally
"sheltered.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that"
sounds
great.
so
it's
a
corkscrew
"stairwell.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
is
that
"general?\""
"\"50.\""
i
"said,"
"\"50,"
what
a
"deal,"
so
for
"$50,000"
i
can
get
a
"stairway?\""
"\"no,"
sir.
$50
"million.\""
i
"said,"
"\"forget"
about
the
stairwell.
forget
"it.\""
he
said
50.
i
really
thought
he
meant
"$50,000."
so
these
are
just
some
little
stories.
i
guess
i
must
like
minnesota
to
go
on
one
of
these
deals.
but
"boy,"
did
you
get
your
money's
worth
tonight?
is
anybody
having
a
bad
time?
did
you
get
your
money's
worth?
because
you've
heard
the
other
one.
we've
done
"this,"
and
we've
cut
your
"taxes,"
and
we
built
up
the
military
bigger
and
better.
and
we're
the
number
one
in
history
in
regulation
"cuts,"
which
is
the
biggest
thing.
and
the
"judges,"
which
we've
done
at
a
level
like
nobody's
ever
"done,"
everything
we've
done.
nobody
has
done
more
in
three
and
a
half
"years,"
no
administration
three
and
a
half.
those
first
three
and
a
half
"years,"
nobody
even
comes
close.
and
you
"know,"
it's
a
funny
thing.
i
say
it
all
the
time.
i've
been
saying
it
for
a
long
time
and
the
fake
"news,"
nobody
even
questions
me
about
it.
and
you
know
if
i
was
"wrong,"
they
"would,"
but
they
can't
question
me
because
when
you
see
right
to
"try,"
we
took
care
of
our
vets.
we
just
got
a
91%
approval
rating
from
the
vets
91.
it's
never
happened
before.
we
got
choice
"approved,"
we
got
accountability
"approved,"
drugs
are
way
down.
we've
got
a
little
setback
with
this
whole
situation
where
these
shutdowns
cause
a
lot
of
problems
with
"drugs,"
a
lot
of
"everything,"
but
drugs
were
way
down.
we
had
our
best
year
in
the
history
of
our
country
last
year.
and
we're
going
to
have
a
better
year
coming
up.
that's
why
you
have
an
obligation
to
vote
for
the
guy
that
got
you
there.
and
remember
"this,"
and
i
really
appreciate
"this,"
thank
you.
but
i
appreciate
this
because
nine
democrat
mayors
of
cities
in
the
iron
range
have
endorsed
me
over
sleepy
joe.
what
do
you
like
better?
sleepy
joe
or
slow
joe?
what's
better?
let's
do
a
poll.
we
do
a
poll.
we
do
a
poll.
i
do
free
falls.
you
"know,"
these
"polls,"
they
charge
you
a
fortune
for
this
stuff.
they
interviewed
three
people
and
then
they
charge
you
a
million
dollars.
we
interviewed
233
"people,"
i
got
thousands
of
people
at
least
for
free.
what
do
you
like
better
as
nickname?
slow
joe
or
sleepy
joe?
so
let's
go.
"wait,"
slow
joe
first.
okay?
so
just
scream
if
you
like
it.
so
you
have
a
"choice,"
slow
"joe,"
they're
both
very
appropriate.
slow
joe
or
sleepy
"joe,"
ready?
slow
joe.
i
think
we're
going
to
have
a
winner
here.
sleepy
joe
based
"steel,"
real
crap.
it
wasn't
"that,"
but
when
you
think
of
"it,"
they
wrote
it
out.
you
didn't
have
environmentally
the
right.
somebody
"said,"
"\"oh,"
well
he
got
a
bit
because
he
was
good
with
negotiating
with
these
other
"countries.\""
it
wasn't
that.
i
opened
it
up.
i
signed
an
order.
i
signed
an
executive
order
because
obama
took
your
iron
range
and
biden
took
your
iron
range
away.
and
i'll
never
forget.
the
day
i
did
"it,"
and
tom
was
"there,"
a
"man,"
i
don't
know
who
he
"is,"
he's
probably
in
this
massive
"audience,"
but
he
came
up
to
me
and
he
was
a
rough
guy
and
he
never
cried
in
his
"life,"
including
at
childbirth.
he
didn't
cry
at
"childbirth,"
but
he
was
crying.
and
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
you
gave
our
life
back
to
us
because
obama
took
our
heart
out
when
he
closed
up
the
iron
"range.\""
he
said
you
gave
our
heart
back.
it's
true.
so
i
just
want
to
thank
those
cities.
when
a
democrat
"mayor,"
and
we
have
now
a
lot
of…
now
we
have
additional.
so
these
are
democrat
politicians
and
two
weeks
ago
they
endorsed
"us,"
and
it's
a
great
thing.
we're
finding
that
all
over
the
country.
democrats
for
trump.
politicians
that
got
elected
as
"democrats,"
i
don't
think
they
changed
their
party
"affiliation,"
but
they
endorsed
trump.
they're
all
in
the
iron
range
area.
and
larry
cuffe
is
here.
larry
cuffe.
where's
larry?
where
is
he?
"larry,"
how
are
you?
why
did
you
do
"that,"
larry?
that's
so
nice.
i
appreciate
it.
"boy,"
are
you
good.
i
wish
you
had
a
mic.
he
"said,"
"\"because"
you're
the
best
candidate
we
could
"ever…\""
i
love
this
guy.
said
you're
the
best
candidate
we
could
ever
hope
for.
thank
you
"larry,"
that's
beautiful.
i
appreciate
it.
we'll
do
a
good
job.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
down.
and
they're
doing
a
good
job
over
there.
so
dig
"in,"
dig
"in,"
dig
we
"must,"
right?
it's
all
going
because
of
me.
that's
"cool,"
man.
thank
you.
"no,"
he
signed
an
executive
order
shutting
it
down.
just
shutting
it
down.
and
i
hear
it's
got
the
best
iron
ore
anywhere
in
the
world.
that's
what
i
hear.
the
quality
is
the
best.
…
or
anywhere
in
the
world.
that's
what
i
hear.
the
quality
is
the
best.
and
it's
like
an
unlimited
amount.
i'm
talking
about
a
"little,"
this
is
a
massive
operation
with
thousands
of
people
and
everything
else.
and
for
"me,"
it
was
very
easy.
andrea
"zupancich,"
where
is
she?
where's
andrea?
thank
you
very
much.
that's
really
nice.
i'm
glad
that
at
least
you
got
a
good
"location,"
right?
that's
great.
i
appreciate
it
very
much.
you're
all
friends
i
guess.
chris
"vreeland,"
where's
chris?
chris
vreeland.
chris?
where's
chris?
the
mayor?
thank
"you,"
chris.
thank
"you,"
chris.
thank
you
very
much.
kathy
brandau.
kathy
brandau.
thank
"you,"
kathy.
i
hope
you're
having
a
good
time
tonight.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
down.
you
know
that.
we're
open.
that
sucker
is
open.
we're
not
closing
it.
"well,"
think
of
this
though.
if
biden
gets
"in,"
it's
closed.
he
said
he's
going
to
close
it.
how
about
this
guy?
no
fracking.
you're
not
going
to
frack.
onstage
with
all
these
crazy
people
and
they
don't
want
any
energy.
they
think
everything's
going
to
run
by
"wind,"
which
costs
you
a
"fortune,"
about
20
times
more
than
what
we
have
and
doesn't
work.
but
think
of
"it,"
all
of
these
people…
and
they
"say,"
"\"what"
about
fracking?
fracking
is
the
modern
technology.
and
so
they
all
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
we're
all
against…
everyone's
against
fracking.
what
about
"you?\""
"yes,"
i'm
against
it
too.
now
he's
against
it
for
months.
he
gets
"it,"
now
he's
in
favor
of
it.
but
he's
sort
of
grandfathering
it.
you
"know,"
it's
a
very
weak…
"well,"
i
like
to
grandfather
fracking.
if
i'm
a
"fracker,"
i
don't
want
to
be
grandfather.
i
want
to
have
it
or
not
have
"it,"
right?
he
wants
to
grandfather
fracking.
always
go
with
their
first
"statement,"
okay?
so
i
was
in
texas
two
weeks
"ago,"
we
had
crowds.
"mike,"
we
had
crowds
that
went
from
the
airplane
to
the
"well,"
to
the
drilling
"well,"
where
we
went
to
see
a
well.
and
we
saved
the
industry
because
i
got
russia
and
saudi
arabia
to
cut
back
10
million
barrels.
it
actually
was
probably
18.
ended
up
"being,"
i
"think,"
18.5
million
barrels.
and
it
saved
the
industry.
and
yet
you're
still
paying
very
low
gasoline
prices
at
the
"pump,"
but
we
saved
10
million
jobs.
but
i'm
in
"texas,"
and
let
me
tell
"you,"
texas
appreciated
it
because
that
industry
was
in
deep
trouble
because
all
of
a
sudden
with
the
"pandemic,"
there
was
no
demand.
there
was
nobody
"driving,"
there
was
no
demand.
nobody
ever
saw
anything
like
it.
so
i'm
in
texas
and
i
said
to
the
"crowd,"
it
was
a
great
"crowd,"
and
we
must
have
had
a
hundred
thousand
people
on
the
"road,"
on
the
highways
and
roadways
waving.
and
they
had
the
most
beautiful
trump
flags.
i
wanted
to
"stop,"
"\"where"
did
you
buy
that
"flag?\""
the
most
beautiful
flags
of
me
and
our
great
vice
president.
is
mike
pence
doing
a
good
job
by
the
way?
he
did
such
a
great…
he
worked
29
hours
a
day.
i
"mean,"
this
guy
works
day
and
night.
he
worked
not
the
24.
he
worked
24
plus
least
"five,"
okay.
this
man
is
a
worker
and
he's
a
wonderful
human
being.
and
when
they
try
"it,"
a
guy
like
biden
that
can't
carry
his
jockstrap.
when
biden
"goes,"
"\"oh,"
they
should
have
closed
one
week
"earlier\","
and
here's
the
guy
that
said
i
made
a
mistake
when
i
banned
china
that
nothing's
going
to
happen.
it's
so
phony.
this
politics
is
a
very
phony
business.
i
haven't
been
doing
it
long.
i
told
one
of
the
senators
that
came
"in,"
he
came
into
my
office
"there,"
"\""
i've
been
doing
this
for
30
years.
i've
won
many
"elections,"
i've
only
lost
twice
in
my
life.
i've
been
a
senator
for
a
long
time.
i
know
what
i'm
"doing,"
"sir\"."
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
and
i've
done
it
for
four
years.
and
i've
only
won
one
"election,"
but
it's
for
the
president
of
the
united
"states.\""
i
remember
a
certain
man
on
television
that
didn't
like
me
too
much.
he
"said,"
"\"they"
put
together
the
greatest
field
ever
"assembled,"
the
"republicans,"
remember?
17
plus
me.
they
put
together
the
greatest
field
of
talent
ever
assembled.
i
hear
trump
wants
to
come
in.
he's
not
going
to
do
it
number
one.
number
"two,"
if
he
"does,"
he's
just
doing
it
for
fun
and
he'll
be
out
by
september
and
then
he'll
go
about
leading
his
"life,"
but
he's
not
going
to
do
it.
but
we
don't
really
need
him
because
this
is
the
greatest
single
assemblage
of
talent
ever
assembled
for
one
"party.\""
the
greatest
talent
he's
ever
seen.
and
then
i
did
it
and
just
week
after
"week,"
one
"out,"
two
"out,"
three
"out,"
four
out.
and
then
we've
done
changes.
"oh,"
he
"said,"
"\"he"
can't
do
it
because
he
doesn't
have
any
"experience.\""
but
i
actually
do
on
the
other
side.
i
contributed
to
politics.
i
always
found
it
very
interesting.
so
in
a
certain
"way,"
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
probably.
maybe
i
had
too
much
experience.
that's
why
i
can
tell
you
about
aoc.
check
out
the
$2
million
"please,"
check
it
"out,"
check
it
out.
check
out
"omar,"
check
out
"omar,"
get
to
that
great
"writer,"
he
should
get…
"oh,"
so
the
new
york
times
won
all
these
pulitzer
"prizes,"
right?
i
was
going
to
tell
you
before.
all
these
pulitzer
"prizes,"
these
"people,"
and
they
all
got
it
"wrong,"
right?
they
got
for
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
we
give
the
pulitzer
prize.
i
won't
use
names.
i
won't
use
"names,"
but
we
give
the
pulitzer
prize
to
the
new
york
times.
they
got
it
wrong.
we
give
the
pulitzer
prize
to
the
washington
post
and
all
of
these
real
sleazebags.
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you.
very
dishonest
"people,"
very
dishonest.
i
call
it
the
amazon
washington
post.
he
uses
that
as
his
lobbyist
because
he
owns
the
washington
post.
he
gets
crap
that
other
people
wouldn't
"get,"
okay.
that
means
it's
a
lobby.
it's
a
lobbyist
deal.
but
they
got
the
"prize,"
right?
they
got
the
pulitzer
prize.
all
the
guys
that
got
it
"right,"
that
really
got
it
"right,"
they
all
got
it
"wrong,"
totally
wrong.
and
they
should
return
the
pulitzer
prize.
and
pulitzer
"association,"
the
committee
should
ask
for
those
prizes
back.
they
got
it
all
wrong.
they
were
a
hundred
percent
wrong.
there
was
no
collusion.
they
couldn't
believe.
remember
the
day
when
it
was
announced
after
three
"years,"
there
is
no
collusion.
i
could
have
told
them
that
a
day
"one,"
they
could
have
saved
48
million
dollars.
they
got
the
pulitzer.
and
then
you
take
guys
so
"many,"
so
many.
"solomon,"
sara
"carter,"
bongino.
how
about
dan
bongino?
so
"many,"
so
talented
guys.
how
about
that
great
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
witch
hunt?
remember
that?
that
was
the
"first,"
right?
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
he's
fantastic.
all
great.
these
people
should
have
won
the
pulitzer
prize.
now
i
would
say
sean
hannity
and
lou
dobbs
and
laura
and
tucker.
in
all
"fairness,"
tucker
was
very
good.
tucker
was
"great,"
but
these
are
all
people
that
got
it
right.
now
they
don't
do
i
guess
the
pulitzer
prize
for
that
"stuff,"
but
they
probably
should.
but
these
guys
all
got
it
right.
and
all
they
did
was
get
a
lot
of
money
because
they're
very
"successful,"
and
that's
okay
i
guess.
but
they
should
give
the
pulitzer
prize
to
the
people
that
got
it
right
and
they
should
withdraw
from
all
of
those
"writers,"
many
of
whom
are
back
there
right
"now,"
all
of
those
"writers,"
they
should
do
that.
and
a
candidate
for
"congress,"
michelle
"fischbach,"
who's
supposed
to
be
fantastic.
and
michelle
has
my
complete
and
total
endorsement.
but
"jason,"
you're
in
good
"shape,"
wow.
you're
in
better
shape
than
these
congressman
jase.
by
the
"way,"
jason
is
fantastic
and
he's
doing
a
fantastic…
where's
michelle?
is
she
there?
be
careful.
it's
not
worth
the
broken
legs.
look
at
her.
"oh,"
she's
a
"warrior,"
i
can
tell.
come
on
up.
but
"thanks,"
michelle.
and
they
have
my
complete
endorsement.
they're
great
people.
they
love
your
state.
they
love
our
country.
so
just
in
"conclusion,"
i
want
to
say
that
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world.
and
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we
will
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
states.
and
you
probably
heard
me
today.
it
used
to
be
puerto
rico
did
tremendous
dollars
in
medical
supplies.
and
then
what
happened?
they
made
a
"lot,"
they
did
a
good
"job,"
and
obama
biden
destroyed
it.
they
took
away
the
"incentive,"
all
of
the
taxes.
and
they
took
away
the
incentive
and
puerto
rico
went
down
a
long
way.
we'll
get
some
of
that
back
to
puerto
rico
and
we'll
get
it
back
for
us.
take
it
away
from
china.
you
heard
"that,"
yes?
they
took
it
away.
and
then
people
automatically
vote.
it's
like
a
habit.
will
i
vote
for
the
democrat?
the
democrat
was
so
bad
to
you.
and
how
bad
were
the
democrats
to
israel?
we
did
"jerusalem,"
right?
we
broke
up
the
iran
"deal,"
right?
and
then
they
vote
for
a
democrat.
it's
out
of
"habit,"
but
i
think
the
"habits,"
we're
breaking
those
habits
very
quickly.
but
we've
helped
puerto
rico
and
we've
really
helped…
if
you
look
at
what
we've
done
for
"israel,"
it's
been
incredible.
they
say
nobody's
done
more.
and
it's
my
honor.
but
we'll
hire
more
"police,"
increase
penalties
for
assaults
on
law
"enforcement,"
and
we
will
ban
deadly
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
are
a
disaster.
we'll
appoint
tough
on
crime
prosecutors.
we
will
nominate
judges
and
justices
who
interpret
the
constitution
as
written.
we
will
ensure
equal
justice
for
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
and
that's
why
the
supreme
court
is
so
important.
the
next
president
will
get
"one,"
"two,"
"three,"
or
four
supreme
court
justices.
i
had
two.
many
presidents
have
had
none.
they've
had
none
because
they're
there
for
a
long
time.
they
tend
to
be
appointed
young.
they're
there
for
a
long
time.
but
the
next
one
we'll
have
anywhere
from
one
to
four.
think
of
that.
that
will
totally
change
when
you
talk
about
"life,"
when
you
talk
about
second
"amendment,"
when
you
talk
about
things
that
are
so
important
to
you.
you're
going
to
be
stuck
for
40
"years,"
35
"years,"
a
long
time.
so
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
important
"election,"
in
my
"opinion,"
in
the
history
of
our
country.
you
got
to
get
it
right.
because
if
you
don't
get
it
"right,"
we
will
not
have
a
country
anymore.
you're
not
going
to
have
a
country.
not
as
we
know
it.
you
won't
have
a
country
anymore.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
"speech,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
citizens
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
these
"ridiculous,"
"horrible,"
endless
foreign
wars.
countries
you've
never
heard
of.
coming
home.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military
"mind,"
and
we
will
ensure
peace
through
strength.
this
is
what
we
have
now.
peace
through
strength.
remember
what
i
told
you
about
those
"weapons,"
we
don't
want
to
use
"ever,"
we
don't
want
to
use
those
weapons.
we
will
end
surprise
medical
"billing,"
require
price
"transparency,"
january
1st.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
do
anything
now.
i'll
be
so
angry
if
he…
they'll
"say,"
"\"what"
a
job
he's
done
on
"transparency,"
can
you
believe
"it?\""
and
he
won't
even
know
what
transparency
is.
and
it's
complex.
and
further
reduce
health
insurance
premiums
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs.
we've
done
that
already.
we
will
strongly
protect
medicare
and
social
"security,"
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on
mars.
and
we
brought
nasa
back.
"nasa,"
when
i
got
in
three
and
a
half
years
"ago,"
grass
was
growing
through
the
cracks
of
the
runway.
it
was
"over,"
it
was
closed.
it
was
nothing.
now
it's
the

we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students
and
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools.
we
will.
we
will
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
will
live
by
the
timeless
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
trust.
you
know
that
the
democrat
national
convention
and
the
pledge
of
allegiance
at
a
"caucus,"
two
of
"them,"
not
one.
i
heard
the
first
"one,"
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
they
must've
made
a
"mistake.\""
they
left
under
god
out
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
now
they
then
"said,"
"\"oh,"
well
we
didn't
mean
"that.\""
they
meant
it.
that's
what
they're
going
to
do.
they're
going
to
take
god
out
of
it.
just
like
i
was
saying
"before,"
"texas,"
they
don't
want
"god,"
they
don't
want
"oil,"
they
don't
want
guns.
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
do
too
well
in
texas.
do
you
agree
with
that?
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
do
too
well
in
minnesota
either.
"no,"
but
could
you
imagine
you're
"campaigning,"
and
it
doesn't
play
too
well
"here,"
but
could
you
imagine
you're
in
texas
and
you
have
a
guy
"say,"
"\"no"
"oil,"
no
"god,"
no
guns.
"oh,"
i
think
i'm
going
to
vote
for
joe
"biden,"
"everybody.\""
and
then
they
"say,"
"\"texas"
is
in
"play,"
it's
a
very
"close…\""
i
have
a
friend
in
texas.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
think
you're
winning
by
15
"points.\""
these
people
are
crazy.
texas
is
in
play.
they
don't
want
to
let
you
have
oil.
think
of
it.
it's
unbelievable.
texas
is
in
play.
that's
the
fake
news
back
there.
they
said
it
last
time
too.
remember?
"texas,"
when
they
say
in
"play,"
that
means
it's
too
close
to
call.
it's
in
play.
too
close.
we've
heard
that
for
a
long
"time,"
in
"play,"
right?
too
close
to
call.
and
they
said
it
four
years
"ago,"
"\"texas"
is
in
play.
this
could
be
a
terrible
"defeat,"
losing
texas.
big
"state,"
great
state.
this
would
be
a
tremendous
"defeat.\""
and
they
said
it
about
ohio
too.
i
think
we
won
by
like
nine
points.
right?
they
said
ohio
is
in
play.
utah's
in
play.
we
won
by
a
lot.
remember
we
beat
a
guy
named
mcmuffin.
remember
the
guy?
he
was
going
to
take
the
state
of
utah.
and
then
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
negotiate.
but
that
didn't
work
out.
he
came
in
third.
even
hillary
beat
him.
but
they
said
texas
is
in
play.
and
i'd
go
around
telling
my
"people,"
"\"damn"
"it,"
texas
is
in
"play,"
how
the
hell?
every
time
i
go
"there,"
i
have
"35,000"
people
at
the
"stadium,"
how
could
it
possibly
be
in
"play?\""
they
said
it's
in
play.
my
people
would
"say,"
"\"i"
don't
think
"so.\""
and
we
had
a
big
texas
rancher.
he
was
on
one
of
the
shows.
he
was
wearing
a
"big,"
beautiful
hat.
i
wish
i
could
wear
those
hots.
it
wouldn't
work
for
me
too
well.
i
don't
think
it
works
for
"me,"
right?
but
it
worked
for
him.
and
he
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know
too
much
about
a
"lot,"
but
i
know
one
thing.
texas
is
not
in
play.
and
this
guy
is
going
to
win
texas
by
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
"votes.\""
and
that's
what
happened
that
"night,"
the
night
of
the
election.
the
night
of
the
"election,"
they
called
the
results.
i've
been
listening
for
six
"months,"
"\"texas"
is
so
"close,"
we
can't
even
imagine
it
it's
so
close.
this
is
"big.\""
and
they
only
call
the
election
immediately
if
you
win
in
a
"landslide,"
it's
got
to
be
tremendous.
and
they
"said,"
"\"texas"
has
closed
its
doors.
ladies
and
"gentlemen,"
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
"texas.\""
they
didn't
even
say
the
polls
were
closed.
they
forgot
to
say
the
polls
were
closed.
i
wanted
to
say.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
come
i
"won?\""
i
called
my
"people,"
"\"how"
could
i
have
won?
it
was
so
close
they
called
it
before
they
even
said
the
doors
"closed.\""
and
i
heard
from
the
governor
of
"texas,"
great
"guy,"
greg
abbott.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
are
we
doing
compared
to
four
years
"ago?\""
we
did
great
four
years
"ago,"
"big,"
big
win.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
you're
doing
much
"better.\""
but
these
guys
keep
saying
it's
in
play.
it's
the
same
way
that
i'm
down
nine
points
in
minnesota.
if
i
lose
"minnesota,"
if
i
lose
"minnesota,"
"jason,"
i'm
going
to
blame
jason
if
i
lose.
"boy,"
we
almost
had
it
last
time.
but
we
did
the
right
thing.
we
went
to
"michigan,"
we
won
"michigan,"
first
time
in
"many,"
many
"years,"
that
michigan
was
won.
it's
a
great
state.
for
years
you
had
a
president
who
apologized
for
america.
and
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
standing
up
for
minnesota.
so
get
your
"friends,"
get
your
"family,"
get
your
"neighbors,"
get
your
"coworkers,"
and
get
out
and
vote.
and
you
know
it's
starting
today
in
minnesota.
that's
why
i'm
here.
it
started
today.
go
out
of
here.
you
know
what?
if
they're
"closed,"
what
the
hell
time
is
it
now?
if
they're
"closed,"
just
stand
in
line
like
you
do.
people
were
here
two
days
ago
trying
to
get
in
here.
it's
crazy.
so
do
the
same
thing
at
the
voting
"booth,"
please.
from
st.
paul
to
st.
"cloud,"
from
rochester
to
"duluth,"
and
from
"minneapolis,"
thank
god
we
still
have
"minneapolis,"
to
right
"here,"
right
here
with
all
of
you
great
"people,"
this
state
was
pioneered
by
men
and
women
who
braved
the
wilderness
and
the
winters
to
build
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
for
their
families.
they
were
tough
and
they
were
strong.
you
have
good
genes.
you
know
"that,"
right?
you
have
good
genes.
a
lot
of
it's
about
the
"genes,"
isn't
it?
don't
you
believe?
the
resource
theory
you
think
was
so
different?
you
have
good
genes
in
minnesota.
they
didn't
have
a
lot
of
money.
they
didn't
have
a
lot
of
"luxury,"
but
they
had
"grit,"
they
had
"faith,"
and
they
had
each
other.
that's
what
you
have
now.
you
have
each
other.
they
were
miners
and
"lumberjacks,"
fishermen
and
"farmers,"
shipbuilders
and
shopkeepers.
but
they
all
had
one
thing
in
common.
they
loved
their
"families,"
they
loved
their
"countries,"
and
they
loved
their
god.
proud
citizens
like
you
helped
build
this
country.
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
with
your
"help,"
your
devotion
and
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"working,"
we're
going
to
keep
on
"fighting,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
and
don't
"forget,"
you
went
through
years
where
you
weren't
"winning,"
right?
years
and
"years,"
they
closed
down.
even
with
"obama,"
he
closed
that
iron.
i
think
he
just
wanted
to
get
even
with
"you,"
i
don't
know.
he
wasn't
good.
not
a
good…
we've
knocked
out
about
84%
of
the
things
he
did.
then
you
"say,"
"\"i"
wonder
if
he
likes
"me?\""
but
you're
getting
used
to
winning
and
you're
going
to
see
winning
like
you've
never
seen
before.
you
had
your
best
year
and
you're
going
to
win
so
much.
you've
heard
"this,"
right?
i
haven't
said
it
in
a
long
time
because
we've
been
doing
a
lot
of
"winning,"
but
you're
going
to
win
so
much.
and
you're
going
to
send
jason
to
the
us
senate.
and
you're
going
to
keep
winning
and
winning
and
winning.
you're
going
to
win
on
"trade,"
you're
going
to
win
on
the
military.
you're
going
to
win
on
everything
you
touch.
minnesota
is
going
to
keep
on
winning
and
you're
going
to
get
tired
of
winning
because
minnesota
doesn't
want
to
win
all
the
time.
your
football
team
is
going
to
win
in
the
big
10
they
"say,"
right?
"no,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
winning
in
minnesota.
and
you're
going
to
get
so
tired
you're
going
to
"say,"
"\"jason,"
"jason,"
"please,"

"jason,"
go
to
the

him
in

can't
stand
it.
"jason,"
"please,"

jason.
stop
him
from
winning
so
much
for
minnesota.
we
can't
take
it.
we're
not
used
to
it
because
we
went
through
years
and
years
and
years
where
it
was
"tough\","
right?
the
mayors
know
that.
that's
why
they
all
endorsed
the
president.
and
i'm
going
to
look
at
"jason,"
i'm
going
to
"say,"
"\"no,"
"jason,"
i'm
sorry.
the
people
of
minnesota
want
to
"win,"
you're
"wrong,"
jason.
they
want
to

we're
going

keep
on
winning.
and
they're
going
to
be
happy
as
"hell,"
"jason.\""
get
jason
"in,"
he's
a
great
guy.
by
the
"way,"
you
have
a
senator
that
he's
running
against.
i
won't
even
mention
names.
she
does
"nothing,"
nothing.
nobody
even
knows
who
the
hell
she
is.
she
goes
to
a
meeting
the
other
"day,"
everyone's
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
she?
this
guy…
he
even
looks
the
role.
central
"casting,"
right?
if
you
can
get
the
look
for
"free,"
that's
good
too.
right?
but
he's
going
to
be
fantastic.
tremendous
"guy,"
really
successful.
and
he
loves
your
state
and
he
loves
our
country.
so
"jason,"
please
knock
them
out.
knock
them
out.
but
you're
going
to
win.
we're
one
movement.
we're
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
and
together
with
the
incredible
people
of
"minnesota,"
and
you
know
what's
going
to
be
operating
at
strength?
because
i
owe
it
to
these
incredible
mayors
that
were
so
nice
to
me.
that
was
such
a
nice
thing.
and
i
didn't
politick
you
at
all.
i
never
politicked
you.
i
said
how
nice.
and
it's
happening
with
so
many
other
things.
we
have
other
endorsements
from
police
forces
that
i
never
asked
and
all
of
a
sudden
they're
coming
from
very
hostile
territory.
so
i
just
appreciate
your
being
here.

i'm
saying
this
for
you

[what
a
"crowd,"
what
a
crowd.
get
those
people
over
here.
see
me.
let
them
come
over.
what
is
a
big
"crowd,"
it's
always
big.
we
want
to
win.
we
got
to
win.
we
want
to
save
our
country
from
the
radical
"left,"
the
radical
left
crazies.
thank
you
very
much.
and
"hello,"
north
"carolina,"
"hello,"
north
carolina.
we
love
"you,"
north
carolina.
i'm
thrilled
to
be
in
fayetteville
with
thousands
of
"loyal,"
hard
working
american
patriots.
and
you
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
45
days
from
"now,"
and
you're
watching
those
polls.
they
go
"up,"
"up,"
up
up.
45
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
north
carolina.
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
as
we
meet
"tonight,"
our
nation
mourns
the
loss
of
a
legal
giant
supreme
court
"justice,"
ruth
bader
ginsburg.
her
landmark
"rulings,"
fierce
devotion
to
justice
and
her
courageous
battle
against
cancer
inspire
all
americans.
you
may
agree.
you
may
not
disagree
with
"her,"
but
she
was
an
inspiration
to
a
tremendous
number
of
people.
i
"say,"
all
americans
justice
ginsburg's
close
relationship
with
a
friend
of
"ours,"
a
friend
of
"mine,"
justice
"scalia,"
is
also
a
powerful
reminder
that
we
can
disagree
on
fundamental
issues
while
treating
each
other
with
"decency,"
"dignity,"
and
respect.
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
her
family.
thank
you
very
much.
so
article
ii
of
our
constitution
says
the
president
shall
nominate
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
any
more
"clear,"
can
it?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
what
do
you
"think,"
thom?
thom
"tillis,"
i
don't
think
it
can
be
any
more
clear.
this
can
only
happen
in
north
carolina.
i
hope
you
hear
that
back
home.
look
at
all
that
press.
that's
a
lot
of
press.
that's
a
lot
of
fake
news.
"well,"
i
hope
they
hear.
so
the
"chant,"
this
is
a
new
one.
fill
that
seat.
this
is
the
chant.
this
can
only
happen
to
me.
fill
that
seat.
now
it
says
the
president
is
supposed
to
fill
the
"seat,"
right?
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
do.
we're
going
to
fill
the
seat.
with
a
great
hat.
i
want
to
try
one
of
those
hats.
i
love
that.
"no,"
think
of
it.
29
"times,"
every
single
time
nobody
"said,"
"\"oh,"
let's
not
fill
the
"seat.\""
we
won
the
election.
now
then
we
have
some
senators
"that,"
forget
it.
think
of
"it,"
i
won't
say
it.
i
won't
say
"it,"
susan.
i
won't
say
"it,"
susan.
but
thom
tillis
is
with
us.
i
can
tell
you
that.
great.
we
have
great
republican
senators.
we
have
great
people
and
we
have
a
great
country.
that's
"really,"
we
have
a
great
country.
and
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
so
we
win
an
election
and
those
are
the
consequences.
it's
called
fill
that
seat
and
that's
what
we're
doing.
the
supreme
court
was
a
very
central
issue
in
both
the
2016
presidential
election
and
then
the
2018
midterm
elections
"where,"
by
the
"way,"
i
didn't
run.
we
had
a
lot
of
"people,"
a
lot
of
people
"said,"
"\"oh,"
he
really
took
a
little
bit
of
a
"shellacking.\""
not
nearly
as
bad
as
others.
in
"fact,"
we
gained
seats
in
the
"senate,"
but
they
never
talk
about
that.
they
don't
talk
about
that.
we
gained
two
seats.
nobody
talked
about
it.
but
we
didn't
run.
and
i
had
a
lot
of
people
"that,"
"\"sir,"
we'll
never
vote
in
"2018.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
no
"vote,"
everybody
vote.
they
just
didn't.
i
think
we
were
like
9
million
people
decided
they
wanted
to
wait
and
they've
waited
and
you
see
what's
going
on.
you
see
what's
happening.
you
see
the
enthusiasm
that
we
have.
"which,"
by
the
"way,"
we
set
a
record
in
2016.
the
bad
news
for
the
democrats
is
we
are
more
enthusiastic
now.
not
even
"close,"
than
we
were
in
2016.
we
are
getting
crowds
and
this
is
pandemic
and
we're
rounding
the
turn.
we're
rounding
the
corner
of
the
pandemic.
but
we're
having
them
outside.
and
we
shouldn't
say
this
is
some
kind
of
a
rally
from
now
on.
it's
called
a
protest.
we
are
protesters.
we're
going
to
call
on
our
rallies
that
because
you
see
a
lot
of
"these,"
let's
call
them
blue
"states,"
we
want
to
be
nice.
we're
going
to
call
it
a
protest
against
stupidity.
so
we
are
going
to
have
protests
against
stupidity.
and
pennsylvania.
look
what
they're
doing
in
pennsylvania.
a
great
"state,"
that's
actually
something
very
special
is
going
to
happen
"here,"
in
pennsylvania.
that's
a
commonwealth.
we
always
have
to
remember
"pennsylvania,"
commonwealth.
got
two
of
them
and
you
better
remember
you
get
in
trouble.
but
we
love
pennsylvania.
and
it's
a
shut
down.
the
governor's
got
it
just
shut
down
nice
and
tight.
and
you
know
what?
on
november
"4th,"
it's
going
to
be
opened
up.
because
they're
trying
to
hurt
our
numbers.
but
our
economic
numbers
are
so
good.
they're
staggering.
they're
the
best
we've
ever
had.
"jobs,"
"retail,"
"stock,"
"market,"
everything.
and
this
is
with
a
lot
of
shutdowns
by
democrats.
that's
all
they're
doing.
on
november
"4th,"
they'll
"announce,"
"\"we've"
decided
to
open
"up.\""
one
of
the
teachers
groups
"said,"
"actually,"
one
of
the
unions
and
one
of
the
politicians
in
california
"said,"
"\"no,"
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
we
need
to
do
it.
we
should
be
open
by
november
"4th.\""
that
was
not
a
good
thing
for
them
to
say.
that
person
i
think
was
"fired,"
i
think
was
fired.
in
both
the
2016
and
the
2018
"elections,"
the
american
people
chose
a
president
and
a
senate
majority
united
in
their
commitment
to
selecting
nominees
who
believe
in
applying
the
constitution
as
written.
both
the
white
house
and
the
senate
majority
have
a
moral
duty
to
fulfill
the
promises
they
made
to
the
voters.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we're
going
to
do.
we
said
that
if
for
any
"reason,"
we
have
a
vacancy
on
the
united
states
supreme
"court,"
we
will
fill
that
vacancy.
we're
not
going
to
"say,"
and
by
the
"way,"
we
have
plenty
of
time.
there's
a
lot
of
time.
you're
talking
about
january
20th.
so
we
will
uphold
equal
justice
under
the
law
for
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
i
won't
be
putting
forth
a
nominee
next
week.
it
will
be
a
woman.
it
will
be
a
woman
"unless,"
"wait,"
"okay,"
let's
do
a
poll.
"oh,"
there
they
are.
how
many
of
these
have
you
come
to?
speaking
of
"women,"
how
many
"of,"
what
is
this
number
one?
like
"90,"
they're
great.
north
"carolina,"
though.
i
see
them
all
over
the
"place,"
they're
great.
"anyway,"
i
hope
your
husbands
are
okay
with
it.
are
they
okay?
they're
okay.
you
have
good
husbands.
but
we're
going
to
do
a
vote.
so
i
"said,"
i
love
these
free
polls
because
pollsters
and
most
of
the
pollsters
are
corrupt
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
if
we
believed
in
pollsters
we
wouldn't
be
here
right
now.
but
we're
actually
getting
very
good.
we
just
had
a
53
from
"rasmussen,"
which
is
very
good.
considering
we
won
four
years
ago
with
a
lot
lower
than
53.
history
has
shown
that
when
you're
at
53
you
can't
lose
an
election.
has
anyone
ever
lost
an
election
with
a
53?
the
answer
is
"yes,"
when
the
other
side
cheats.
that
could
"happen,"
that
could
happen.
that
could
happen.
you
saw
what
happened
in
pennsylvania.
some
state
supreme
court
justice
just
ruled
that
they
can
take
as
long
as
they
want
to
count
the
ballots.
that
means
i'll
be
leading
and
winning
pennsylvania
like
we
did
last
time.
"yeah,"
yeah.
we'll
be
"leading,"
we'll
be
winning
pennsylvania.
we're
going
to
win
it
easy.
we're
going
to
win
your
state
easily.
and
"deb,"
what
a
"great,"
she's
doing
such
a
good
job.
but
"mark,"
just
a
few
months
"ago,"
i've
been
trying
to
get
him
for
three
years
to
leave
and
we
have
a
great
person
running
as
you
know.
"really,"
i
mean
really
great.
does
everyone
know
madison?
yes?
you're
going
to
vote
for
madison?
he's
great.
he's
a
great
guy.
but
mark
had
a
beautiful
head
of
black
hair
and
i
just
noticed
that
hair's
turning
white
very
fast.
but
we're
doing
a
job.
we're
very
close
to
a
great
deal
with
"tiktok,"
tiktok
but
nobody
cares
about
that
anymore.
all
they
care
about
is
fill
that
"seat,"
right?
until
about
24
hours
"ago,"
that's
all
they
talked
about
is
"tiktok,"
tiktok.
we
have
a
deal
worked
"out,"
i
think
with
walmart
is
going
to
buy
it
along
with
oracle.
larry
"ellison,"
it's
going
to
be
an
incredible
combination.
and
i
"said,"
"\"do"
me
a
favor.
could
you
put
up
$5
billion
into
a
fund
for
education
so
we
can
educate
people
as
to
real
history
of
our
"country,"
the
real
"history,"
not
the
fake
"history.\""
because
we're
getting
very
close
to
that
deal.
and
all
of
the
technology
will
be
maintained
here.
they're
going
to
move
probably
to
the
great
state
of
texas.
"sorry,"
we
got
you
a
lot
of
business
when
it
came…
but
they're
going
to
move
into
the
united
"states,"
which
is
what's
important.
they're
moving
to
the
united
"states,"
unbelievable
company.
they're
going
to
have
"25,000"
jobs.
if
it
all
"goes,"
i
gave
them
the
preliminary
approval.
but
they're
putting
up
$5
billion.
and
my
only
problem
is
they
did
it
so
fast.
i
should
have
asked
for
more.
what
happened
is
when
i
suggested
they
should
put
up
a
lot
of
money
everybody
"said,"
"senators,"
"congressmen,"
"women,"
everybody.
they
"said,"
"\"you"
can't
do
that.
that's
never
been
"done.\""
that's
the
"problem,"
nothing's
ever
been
done.
and
we
had
other
"companies,"
a
lot
of
people
wanted
it.
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
put
up
$5
million
either
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
maybe
or
into
some
education
fund
or
do
"something.\""
and
they
were
sort
of
agreeing
with
me.
they
thought
it
was
okay.
and
then
i
went
to
the
legal
legals
here
and
i
"said,"
"\"they're"
going
to
put
up
$5
"million,"
give
it
to
the
united
"states.\""
"\"sir.,you"
can't
do
that.
there's
no
"provision.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
the
hell
can
there
be
no
provision.
we're
making
the
deal
possible.
why
can't
they
give
us
$5
billion
"dollars?\""
that's
"b,"
that's
a
lot
of
money.
"now,"
watch
the
crazy
democrats.
they'll
"go,"
"\"they"
should
have
gotten
more
"money.\""
it's
never
been
done
before.
they
should
"have,"
no
matter
what
you
do.
they
should
have
gotten
more.
schumer
and
nancy
"pelosi,"
crazy
nancy.
but
i'll
tell
you.
and
i
said
it
last
"night,"
we
had
a
great
rally.
last
"night,"
you
saw
that
in
a
place
that
we're
going
to
win.
we're
going
to
win
minnesota.
hasn't
been
won
since
1972.
and
they're
all
"saying,"
"\"well,"
we
did
give
them
back
the
big
iron
ore
"range.\""
it
"was,"
obama
took
it
away
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen.
he
put
everybody
out
of
work.
we
gave
it
back.
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
we're
going
to
have
a
victory
on
november
"3rd,"
the
likes
of
which
you've
never
seen.
now
we're
counting
on
the
federal
court
system
to
make
it
so
that
we
can
actually
have
an
evening
where
we
know
who
wins.
not
where
the
votes
are
going
to
be
counted
a
week
later
or
two
weeks
later.
but
in
just
three
and
a
half
years
under
my
"administration,"
we've
secured
america's
borders
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
u.s
"military,"
think
of
that.
and
i
shouldn't
say
this
and
the
fake
news
keeps
"going,"
"\"oh,"
he's
given
away
classified
"information.\""
no
i'm
not.
we
are
building
and
we
have
built
weapons
the
likes
of
which
this
world
has
never
seen
before.
and
i
said
that
a
week
ago
and
it
was
a
headline
and
one
of
these
fake
newspapers
"where,"
"\"he's"
giving
away
confidential
"information,\""
these
people
are
crazy.
"no,"
no.
i'm
just
telling
you
that-
crazy.
"no,"
no.
i'm
just
telling
you
that
president
putin
and
president
xi
of
"china,"
"russia,"
"china,"
north
"korea,"
everybody.
they
are
so
envious
of
what
we're
doing.
they
can't
even
believe
it.
if
they
"know,"
they
perhaps
don't
know.
under
"obama,"
they
knew
"immediately,"
okay.
under
"us,"
but
we
are
building
"weapons,"
all
made
in
the
usa.
the
likes
of
which
no
country
has
ever
seen
before.
and
hope
to
"god,"
we
never
have
to
use
them.
that's
the
"key,"
i
don't
ever
want
to
use
them.
"remember,"
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
guy
that
was
going
to
get
us
into
a
war
in
the
first
week.
remember
that?
where's
the
war?
we're
taking
them
out
of
afghanistan.
we're
almost
finished
with
that.
working
along
well.
we're
taking
them
out
of
"syria,"
other
than
i
left
some
behind
for
the
"oil,"
we
kept
the
"oil,"
is
it
okay
that
we
kept
the
oil?
is
it
okay
we
kept
the
oil?
let's
go
back
to
my
poll.
ready?
so
we're
"putting,"
i
think
it
should
be
a
"woman,"
because
i
actually
like
women
much
more
than
i
like
"men,"
i
have
to
say.
"no,"
i
do.
i
"do,"
i
like
women
more.
so
i
have
to
make
a
"decision,"
to
fill
the
"seat,"
as
we
"say,"
we
should
have
a
new
campaign.
let's
make
a
"t-shirt,"
fill
the
seat.
okay?
my
people
are
so
"good,"
"tomorrow,"
it'll
be
all
over
the
place.
that's
a
good
idea.
that's
a
good
idea.
fill
the
seat.
okay
watch
"this,"
so
good
tomorrow
you'll
see
them
all
over
the
"place,"
fill
the
seat.
i
don't
know
how
the
hell
they
do
"it,"
but
they
get
it
done
fast.
you
remember
i
"said,"
where's
hunter?
where's
hunter?
the
next
"day,"
it
was
like
one
of
the
biggest
selling
t-
shirts
where
is
hunter?
what
the
hell
ever
happened?
he
took
the
money
and
he
ran
i
think.
where's
hunter?
he
took
the
"money,"
he
went
to
"china,"
he
took
1.5
billion.
he
had
no
experience.
he
didn't
have
a
job
until
this
guy
became
vice
president.
then
he
went
to
"china,"
he
got
$1.5
billion.
i
asked
the
head
of
a
great
"company,"
blackstone.
one
of
the
biggest
in
the
world.
i
"said,"
"\"steve,"
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
is
that
"possible?\""
"\"no,"
that's
never
"done.\""
china
doesn't
do
that.
"well,"
how
did
a
guy
with
no
experience
do
this?
he
"said,"
"\"very"
simple.
his
father's
vice
"president.\""
is
that
what
you
want?
and
then
"ukraine,"
"$183,000"
a
"month,"
and
a
$3
million
upfront
payment
for
him
and
his
"friends,"
think
of
"this,"
with
no
experience
and
no
"job,"
and
they
"said,"
do
you
know
energy?
it's
an
energy
company
that
paid
it.
do
you
know
energy?
"no,"
i
don't.
i've
not
familiar
with
the
subject.
our
great
congressman.
right?
how
the
hell
does
this
happen?
i
think
it
will
be
brought
up
into
debate.
i
think
it
will
be
brought
up
in
the
"debate,"
i
think.
where
is
hunter?
where
is
hunter?
you
know
where
hunter
is?
he's
probably
on
the
riviera
having
a
very
good
time.
he's
giving
some
great
energy
advice.
he's
learning.
he's
taking
a
night
class
on
energy
for
180
grand.
where
is
hunter?
they're
corrupt.
remember
joe
with
a
prosecutor?
$
1
"billion,"
i'm
not
giving
it
to
them
until
they
get
those
prosecutors
away
from
my
son
or
whatever
the
hell
he
"said,"
that
crazy
company
over
in
ukraine.
$1
billion.
i'm
not
giving
it.
you
get
them
out.
and
guess
what?
they
got
them
out.
here's
your
billion
dollars.
now
that's
called
quid
pro
quo.
right?
that's
the
real
deal.
with
"us,"
there
was
none.
they
made
it
up.
remember
when
shift
made
the
phony
speech?
eight
times
he
said
the
same
"thing,"
except
that's
not
what
happened.
"fortunately,"
we
had
those
wonderful
people
that
write
every
perfect
"word,"
every
word.
i'm
glad
we
had
them
because
we're
dealing
with
a
bunch
of
thieving
bad
people.
so
women
and
"men,"
ready?
would
you
rather
have
a
woman
on
the
supreme
court
or
would
you
rather
have
a
man?
ready?
a
woman
or
a
man.
"so,"
would
you
rather
have
me
"choose,"
this
is
a
very
scientific
poll.
"actually,"
it's
a
lot
more
accurate
than
these
polls
that
interview
like
97
people
have
been
"interviewed,"
then
they
charge
you
a
million
dollars
and
they
probably
don't
interview
the
people.
they
sit
behind
their
desk.
would
you
rather
have
a
woman
on
the
supreme
court?
"yes,"
woman.
yes?
tom
tiller
says
yes.
or
would
you
rather
have
a
man
on
the
supreme
court?
what's
going
on?
let's
give
it
one
more
quick
chance.
this
is
a
free
poll.
and
this
is
a
lot
of
people.
this
is
tens
of
thousands
of
people.
this
is
a
lot
of
people.
you
"know,"
the
fake
"news,"
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"
had
a
smattering
of
"people.\""
if
bernie
sanders
had
a
crowd.
"oh,"
he
had
a
massive
crowd.
it
was
so
big.
with
"me,"
my
crowds
are
five
times
bigger
than
bernie's.
and
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"
had
a
smattering
of
"people.\""
they
were
in
the
middle
of
an
airport
that
nobody
ever
heard
of.
thousands.
if
those
"people,"
come
"on,"
bring
them
over.
what
the
"hell,"
at
this
"point,"
might
as
"well,"
let
them
come
on
over.
come
on
over.
you
got
thousands
of
people
behind
these
people.
i
would
imagine
the
sight
lines
aren't
too
good.
you
have
stands
in
front.
okay.
so
one
more
time.
who
would
rather
have
a
man
on
the
supreme
court?
who
would
have
a
woman
on
the
supreme.
now
"tomorrow,"
like
fake
"news,"
"cnn,"
he
was
playing
games
with
the
united
states.
it
is
a
terrible
thing
he's
done.
"no,"
i'm
just
taking
a
"poll,"
please.
and
by
the
"way,"
that's
a
very
accurate
"poll,"
because
that's
the
way
i
feel.
it
will
be
a
"woman,"
a
very
"talented,"
very
brilliant
woman.
who
i
haven't
chosen
"yet,"
but
we
have
numerous
women
on
the
list.
i
built
this
incredible
list
of
brilliant
people.
and
we're
asking
for
biden's
list.
he
can't
give
it.
you
know
why?
because
if
he
ever
gave
a
"list,"
he'd
either
put
somebody
in
the
left
"middle,"
which
would
be
okay.
you
could
get
"votes,"
or
he'd
put
"one,"
"somebody,"
which
is
what
he's
going
to
"choose,"
so
far
"left,"
"now,"
if
he
did
the
left
"middle,"
he
loses
his
entire
left
coast.
right?
and
if
he
loses
the
left
"coast,"
that's
the
end
of
his
election.
and
last
"time,"
remember
how
many
people
i
got
from
"bernie,"
because
of
trade.
a
lot
of
the
bernie
people
vote
for
us
because
bernie
is
right
about
one
"thing,"
trade.
but
bernie
took
a
bad
"defeat,"
didn't
he?
it
was
a
bad
loss.
he's
one
of
the
most
gracious
losers
i've
ever
"seen,"
he
is.
all
elizabeth
"warren,"
pocahontas
had
to
do
is
leave.
if
she
left
before
super
"tuesday,"
bernie
would
have
won
every
one
of
those
"states,"
but
they
split
up
that
vote.
that's
too
"bad,"
but
we
have
sleepy
"joe,"
we'll
see
how
that
works
out.
i
think
it's
working
out
pretty
good.
we
were
winning
so
"much,"
we
didn't
even
"have,"
we
could
have
called
off
the
election.
we
were
winning
by
so
"much,"
and
then
the
plane
came
in
from
china.
and
in
many
"ways,"
i
had
to
go
back
to
"work,"
but
i
had
to
go
back
to
work
on
this
one
too.
and
now
we're
going
up
and
up
and
up
and
we're
winning
and
we're
winning
all
over
the
place.
because
i
happen
to
"think,"
i
just
say
what
i
want.
and
you
"know,"
they
make
up
a
lot
of
false
stories.
they
will
make
up
a
lie.
like
what
i
said
about
military.
can
you
imagine?
no
animal
would
say
that.
they
make
it
up
and
then
they
put
it
in
ads.
so
once
they
did
"that,"
the
only
good
thing
is
i
can
"say,"
i
"said,"
"\"now"
i
can
say
"anything.\""
he
is
the
worst
"candidate,"
the
dumbest
of
all
"candidates,"
but
he
was
dumb
in
prime
"time,"
as
told
to
me
by
a
senator
from
long
"ago,"
he
"said,"
"\"who's"
the
dumbest
in
the
"senate,"
who's
the
smartest
in
the
"senate?\""
the
smartest
"is,"
i
won't
tell
you.
but
the
dumbest
is
joe.
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
"joe.\""
he
"said,"
"\"joe"
"biden.\""
that
was
25
years
ago.
that
was
in
prime
time.
he
is
the
worst
candidate
in
the
history
of
presidential
politics.
if
i
lose
to
"him,"
i
don't
know
what
i'm
going
to
do.
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again.
you'll
never
see
me
again.
"no,"
how
do
you
lose?
he
is
"honestly,"
i
go
up
and
these
guys
are
grilling
me
all
the
time.
stephanopoulos
"grill,"
grill.
okay.
it's
all
right.
it's
okay.
i
think
it
came
out
"very,"
well
it's
"always,"
it
comes
out
well.
you
have
to
be
able
to
answer.
they're
very
weak
compared
to
some
of
the
foreign
people
that
we
deal
with
from
foreign
"countries,"
leaders
of
foreign
countries.
but
i
say
he's
always
using
a
teleprompter.
i
don't
care
if
he
uses
a
"teleprompter,"
you
know
what
bothers
me?
that
means
the
fake
news
is
giving
him
the
questions.
so
that's
what
really…
they
never
gave
me
the
questions.
if
i
ever
"said,"
in
"fact,"
i'm
going
to
say
it
now.
i
want
from
now
on
you
to
give
me
the
questions
before
you
ask
me.
and
i'm
going
to
read
the
questions
off
the
"teleprompter,"
and
the
questions
are
so
easy.
did
you
see
anderson
cooper?
he's
a
nice
guy.
he's
interviewed
me
over
the
"years,"
a
"lot,"
but
he's
a
tough
interviewer.
did
you
see
those
softballs?
what
do
you
think
donald
trump
is
a
very
bad
human
being.
do
you
agree
with
that?
"yes,"
i
"do,"
anderson.
i've
never
seen
"softballs,"
and
actually
they're
getting
hit
by
it.
they're
getting
hit
by
it.
it's
just
a
terrible
thing.
i
"mean,"
this
is
a
"guy,"
i
used
to
call
him
1%
"joe,"
because
he
ran
numerous
times
and
he
could
only
get
1%.
in
"fact,"
he
actually
had
1%
with
an
arrow
pointing
left.
that
means
less
than
one.
now
he's
"shot,"
he's
got
half
of
his
head
"left,"
and
he's
"out,"
think
of
it.
he's
totally
shot.
and
he
ends
up
getting
the
nomination.
he
couldn't
get
it
in
prime
time.
what
the
hell
is
going
on
with
the
world
today?
what's
going
on?
what's
going
on
with
the
"world,"
mark
meadows?
unbelievable
"meadows,"
oh
boy.
he's
a
smart
"guy,"
"meadows,"
"great,"
great
"guy,"
north
"carolina,"
in
just
three
and
a
half
"years,"
we
obliterated
the
isis
caliphate.
remember
when
i
had
it
down
to
"99%,"
they
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
finish
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let"
somebody
else
finish
"it.\""
and
we
"went,"
and
we
finished
it.
we
fixed
our
disastrous
trade
"deals,"
which
we
have.
china's
now
paying
us
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
but
you
"know,"
i
view
it
differently
"now,"
i
view
china
much
differently
"now,"
after
the
plague
came
"in,"
i
view
it
differently.
and
we
brought
your
jobs
back
home
to
north
carolina
and
our
contract.
in
three
years
of
president
"trump,"
real
median
household
income
rose
by
almost
"$7,000."
now
think
of
"that,"
three
"years,"
three
"years,"
right?
achieving
the
highest
median
income
in
the
history
of
our
country.
this
is
in
three
years.
under
16
years
of
"presidents,"
barack
hussein
"obama,"
ladies
and
"gentlemen,"
is
president
barack
hussein
"obama,"
or
as
rush
"limbaugh,"
the
"great,"
how
great
is
rush?
do
we
love
rush?
as
rush
limbaugh
would
"say,"
barack
hussein
obama.
you
ever
hear
rush?
barack
hussein
obama.
rush
is
great.
he's
doing
well
too.
he's
great.
he's
a
tough
guy.
we
love
rush.
we
love
you
rush.
he
watches
every
one
of
these
rallies.
you
"know,"
he
supported
me
when
i
came
down
with
our
great
first
"lady,"
i
came
down
the
escalator.
i
made
a
speech.
i
didn't
even
have
a
speech
"writer,"
i
had
to
wing
it.
the
winging
speeches
are
the
best
ones
like
last
night.
but
rush
"said,"
"\"i"
like
that
guy.
i'd
never
heard
that
before.
i'd
never
heard
we're
going
to
build
a
"wall.\""
we're
going
to
have
secure
borders.
we're
going
to
make
new
trade
deals
that
are
like
sane.
we're
going
to
do
all
the
things
we're
going
to
rebuild
our
military.
we're
going
to
have
a
strong
country
again.
we
did
so
many
"things,"
and
rush
heard
this.
i
didn't
know
rush.
i
"mean,"
maybe
i
met
him
"once,"
"twice,"
for
two
seconds.
and
he
became
an
instant
fan
of
trump.
and
he
was
for
a
long
time
before
i
even
got
to
know
him.
and
he's
been
so
"important,"
he's
the
"king,"
39
million
listeners.
there's
nobody
like
him.
try
sitting
down
for
what
is
it?
three
hours?
and
"talking,"
just
talking
with
everyone.
39
million
"people,"
often.
try
sitting.
we
love
rush.
i
love
rush.
but
"listen,"
try
sitting
down
with
a
radio
show
with
millions
and
millions
of
people
"listening,"
and
talk
for
three
hours
without
phone
calls.
phone
calls
are
easy.
"hey,"
what
do
you
think
of
this?
what
do
you
think.
just
talk.
talk.
and
everybody
finds
it
fascinating.
and
it
is
fascinating.
i
wish
i
had
time
to
listen
more
often.
it's
a
little
tough
as
"president,"
but
everybody
finds
it
fascinating.
and
we
gave
"rush,"
because
he's
such
an
important
person
and
done
such
an
incredible
job
the
presidential
medal
of
freedom.
and
"catherine,"
his
wife
is
great.
what
a
couple.
but
rush
has
been
unbelievable.
he's
so
on
our
side.
and
he
was
from
literally
day
"one,"
right
from
the
beginning.
and
we
don't
have
to
mention
"sean,"
and
"laura,"
and
so
many
others.
we
don't
have
to
mention
"lou,"
the
great
lou
"dobbs,"
right?
i
"mean,"
lou
dobbs
"said,"
lou
started
years
"ago,"
and
he
liked
us
from
the
beginning.
he
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
going
to
be
a
very
good
"president.\""
okay.
that
was
the
first
little
time.
then
he
"went,"
"\"donald"
trump.
i
love
donald
"trump,"
but
he's
the
best
since
ronald
"reagan.\""
then
he
"went,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
an
even
better
president
than
ronald
"reagan.\""
so
that
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
into
it.
then
the
great
lou
dobbs
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
may
be
the
greatest
of
all
time.
greatest
of
all
"time.\""
and
then
somebody
"said,"
"\"can"
i
ask
you
"lou,"
when
you
say
the
"greatest,"
does
that
include
abraham
lincoln
and
george
"washington?\""
he
"said,"
"\"absolutely."
he's
now
the
greatest
of
all
"time.\""
so
we
love
lou
dobbs.
lou
dobbs
is
great.
go
out
and
buy
his
book.
his
book
is
great.
but
we
have
great
support.
we
have
great
support.
tucker's
been
very
good
"lately,"
i
have
to
tell
you.
tucker
has
been
very
good.
tucker
"carlson,"
he's
come
a
long
"way,"
actually
the
whole
thing
with
faking
around
with
our
whole
history.
he's
very
strong
in
"that,"
we
took
care
of
that
very
"powerfully,"
very
powerfully.
we
signed
an
executive
order.
we
fired
a
lot
of
people
that
were
talking
about
cancel
culture
and
a
lot
of
fake
"stuff,"
that
were
getting
paid
a
lot
of
money
that
we're
here
for
a
long
time.
under
16
years
of
presidents
obama
and
"bush,"
the
median
income
only
rose
"$2,900."
now
think
of
that.
so
three
"years,"
it
went
up
"$7,000,"
16
"years,"
it
went
up
less
than
"$3,000."
i'd
say
that's
a
big
difference.
and
that's
not
including
"energy,"
because
look
what
you're
paying
for
your
gasoline
now.
right?
remember
those
days?
remember
those
days
of
"$5,"
you
"said,"
"\"let's"
get
rid
of
that
big
"truck.\""
now
you're
all
buying
bigger
trucks
than
they
ever
thought
possible.
you
know
why?
because
gasoline
is
so
damn
"cheap,"
right?
remember
the
$5
days?
now
you're
below
$2
a
"lot,"
right?
below
two.
i
"mean,"
they're
seeing
numbers
that
nobody
believes.
it's
all
good
stuff.
and
we're
energy
independent.
so
many
things
have
happened.
if
you
add
four
or
"$5,000,"
so
you're
talking
about
by
"$11,000,"
you
got
to
add
the
energy.
i
said
to
my
"people,"
"\"put"
the
energy
"in.\""
"\"well,"
i
don't
know
if
it's
"right.\""
i
"said,"
"\"do"
me
a
"favor,"
just
put
it
"in.\""
in
my
first
three
"years,"
we
lifted
6.6
million
people
out
of
"poverty,"
the
largest
poverty
reduction
of
any
president
in
american
history.
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
now
we're
doing
it
"again,"
and
we're
doing
it
very
rapidly.
this
is
a
super
v.
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
i
don't
"know,"
v
is
going
to
be
very
"hard.\""
"no,"
this
is
a
super
v.
we
will
deliver
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
this
year.
it's
already
in
very
good
shape.
"very,"
very
good
shape.
in
a
matter
of
weeks.
we
will
end
the
pandemic
from
china.
we
will
end
our
plague
from
china.
next
year
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
years
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
it's
heading
that
way.
if
you
take
a
"look,"
automobile
"manufacturing,"
"housing,"
"retailing,"
they're
all
setting
"records,"
they're
through
the
"roof,"
hard
to
"believe,"
"actually,"
during
the
rounding
the
"corner,"
when
i
say
rounding
the
"corner,"
they
go
crazy.
they
want
to
keep
it
going
as
long
as
possible.
if
you
say
anything
"positive,"
they
"say,"
"\"he's"
not
telling
the
truth
to
the
american
"public.\""
i
am
actually
telling
the
truth.
you
know
these
"people,"
they
talked
"about,"
because
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
winston
churchill
was
a
great
"leader.\""
they
said
the
other
"night,"
"\"you"
said
winston
churchill
was
a
great
"leader,"
but
he
didn't
"lie.\""
because
this
"guy,"
woodward.
he
writes
a
book.
he's
had
it.
he's
another
one
shot.
i
compare
him
sort
of
to
biden.
he's
sharper
than
"biden,"
i
have
to
say
"that,"
but
he's
shot.
he's
tired.
he's
exhausted.
i
never
saw
a
guy
be
able
to
do
so
much
"television,"
try
doing
a
book
on
somebody
else.
see
how
much
television
time
they
give
"you,"
like
none.
but
they
said
the
other
"night,"
and
it
was
amazing.
winston
churchill.
they
"said,"
"\"he"
didn't
lie
to
the
"people,"
to
britain.
he
didn't
"lie.\""
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
let
me
ask
you
this.
he
stood
on
buildings
when
the
"nazis,"
"hitler,"
were
bombing
"london.\""
that's
pretty
"brave,"
because
he
may
have
been
doing
a
little
"drinking,"
but
he
was
known
for
"that,"
right?
he's
got
a
right
"to,"
but
it's
true.
he
stood
in
the
buildings
in
"london,"
as
they
were
bombing
"london,"
and
made
"speeches,"
and
made
"statements,"
and
had
everything.
and
he'd
sometimes
have
press
conferences.
and
the
fake
news
wouldn't
show
up.
he
was
standing
"there,"
nobody
was
in
front
of
him.
but
he
would
stand
"there,"
and
he
would
"say,"
"\"you"
are
safe.
you
are
safe.
everything
is
okay.
you
are
"safe.\""
"well,"
that's
a
"lie,"
i
"guess,"
right?
so
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
i
guess
he
"lied.\""
"no,"
he's
a
great
"leader,"
and
he
was
"leading,"
and
he
was
a
"great,"
great
prime
minister.
he
did
a
fantastic
job.
not
lying.
no.
we
love
our
"country,"
we
want
to
lead
our
"country,"
and
we
can't
let
a
thing
like
"this,"
this
is
a
"horrible,"
horrible
thing
that
happened
to
the
world
it
"happened,"
should
have
been
stopped
in
china.
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
the
rest
of
"china,"
should
have
been
stopped
in
china.
to
defeat
the
china
"virus,"
we
launched
the
largest
industrial
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
somebody
"said,"
"\"what"
grade
would
you
give
"yourself?\""
i
"said,"
"\"a+.\""
but
i
would
give
myself
a
"d,"
i
would
say
i
would
give
"myself,"
and
my
whole
"group,"
because
mike
pence
is
"great,"
mike
pence
really
was.
he
worked
so
hard.
and
it's
"unfair,"
he
worked
so
hard.
the
"ventilators,"
the
"vaccines,"
the
therapeutics
now
we
"have,"
look
at
what's
happening.
when
somebody
gets
very
"sick,"
look
how
we
bring
them
back
so
"often,"
compared
to
what
it
was
originally.
i
"mean,"
the
work
that's
been
"done,"
and
wait
until
you
see
what
happens
over
the
next
few
weeks
with
what's
going
on.
but
the
democrats
don't
want
the
vaccine.
they
don't
want
it.
at
"first,"
they
wanted
a
"vaccine,"
because
they
didn't
think
it
could
happen.
now
that
we
have
"it,"
they're
going
"like,"
"\"well,"
we
don't
want
"it.\""
it's
the
craziest
thing.
think
of
"it,"
you
want
to
get
a
"vaccine,"
and
they're
willing
to
hurt
"people,"
let
people
die
for
political
reasons.
think
of
it.
i
"think,"
"honestly,"
i
think
it's
a
disgrace.
but
we
surged
rapid
testing
kits.
we
have
more
testing
than
all
"other,"
i
"mean,"
practically
everybody.
you
look
at
number
two
is
india.
they
have
1.5
billion
people.
we
are
up
50
million
tests
more
than
india.
in
"fact,"
we're
about
to
crack
100
million
tests.
and
when
you
"test,"
then
you
"have,"
does
this
make
sense?
then
you
have
cases.
so
we
do
all
this
"testing,"
and
i
come
home
and
i
turn
on
nbc
news.
it
is
so
bad.
i
think
"nbc,"
that's
not
only
msdnc.
i
think
nbc
with
lester
holt.
there's
another
beauty.
hi
lester.
how
do
you
feel
big
in
second
place
lester?
he
surged
from
first
place
to
second
place.
but
nbc
news
is
"so,"
i
"mean,"
it's
just
terrible.
they
use
free
"airwaves,"
and
then
they
give
you
fake
news.
free
airwaves.
they
should
pay
a
lot
of
money
for
this.
this
is
not
right.
nbc.
it's
owned
by
a
company
called
"concast,"
"c-o-n,"
"concast,"
they're
"con,"
they're
con
men.
it's
a
disgrace.
they
spend
fortunes
on
public
relations
and
then
i
get
up
and
make
a
speech
like
this
with
television
blazing
all
over
the
"world,"
i
guess.
"yeah,"
the
"world,"
it's
all
over
the
world.
and
i
say
"concast,"
and
"immediately,"
there
goes
their
"public,"
how's
your
public
relations
doing
nbc?
not
too
good.
but
they're
just…
they
don't
tell
the
truth.
our
country
would
be
so
much
better
off
if
we
had
honest
"media,"
really.
really
would.
and
do
you
see
what
their
approval
rating
has
gone
to?
i
think
it's
one
of
my
greatest
achievements.
hey
look-
it's
a
saturday
night.
we
have
all
night.
this
happened
last
night
in
minnesota.
i
have
these
teleprompter
"people,"
they're
"great,"
they're
genius.
and
i
was
about
45
minutes
into
the
"speech,"
and
i
realized
i
was
only
on
line
two.
and
he
was
"like,"
"\"what"
do
i
"do?\""
but
we
have
more
fun.
"hey,"
you
now
have
a
president
that
doesn't
have
to
use
a
"teleprompter,"
isn't
that
nice?
and
i
said
last
"night,"
i
"said,"
and
"yeah,"
your
friends
were
there.
the
congressmen.
by
the
"way,"
is
the
media
"now,"
and
i'm
pretty
sure
it's
getting
close.
i
think
they
have
a
lower
approval
rating
than
congress.
congratulations.
"no,"
but
it's
hard.
when
you're
sitting
"there,"
you're
in
"businesses,"
you're
in
"construction,"
you
drive
"trucks,"
you
do
a
lot
of
things.
you're
in
offices.
you
don't
"realize,"
because
you
don't
know
what's
happening.
i
know
exactly
a
true
story.
and
then
it's
written
to
totally
bend
the
"truth,"
to
make
a
good
thing
into
a
bad
thing.
"like,"
can
you
believe
"it,"
in
one
week
they
nominated
"me,"
not
for
"one,"
but
for
two
nobel
prizes.
"no,"
but
think
of
it.
no
but
think.
and
they
didn't
cover
the
story.
now
obama
got
his
the
first
week.
very
liberal
"group,"
and
nobody
knew
what
the
hell
he
got
it
"for,"
and
he
didn't
know.
why
did
you
get
it?
i
don't
know.
remember?
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
idea.
but
you
"know,"
you
have
a
"president,"
you
love
your
"president,"
and
your
president
gets
"honored,"
because
i'm
not
being
"honored,"
you're
being
honored
with
the
nobel
peace
"prize,"
for
"israel,"
what
we
did
with
israel.
i
went
home
and
i
said
to
the
first
"lady,"
"\"darling,\""
she's
very
popular.
she
made
a
great
"speech,"
right?
and
ivanka
made
a
great
"speech,"
right?
but
i
went
home.
i
"said,"
"\"darling,"
i
have
big
news
tonight.
let's
turn
on
the
"television.\""
you
"know,"
we
don't
use
wind.
we
use
"actually,"
we
actually
use
petroleum.
we
use
petro.
because
we
like
it
to
be
on
like
a
lot.
we
don't
like
to
have
lots
of
open
gaps
when
the
wind's
not
blowing.
we
can't
watch
president
trump.
i
go
home.
i
"say,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
a
great
thing
happened
today.
i
was
"honored,"
nobel
peace
"prize,"
nominated.
this
is
a
big
thing
first
"lady.\""
and
then
i
went
home
two
days
later.
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
you're
not
going
to
believe
it.
i
was
honored
again.
nobel
"prize,"
that's
"kosovo.\""
"israel,"
kosovo.
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
this
is
great
news.
let's
turn
on
the
television.
this
is
going
to
be
big.
this
is
going
to
be
big
tonight.
we
just
got
"honored,"
this
is
"big.\""
nobel
"peace,"
can
you
imagine?
you
grow
up
in
"brooklyn,"
"queens,"
and
now
you're
getting
the…
"\"first"
"lady,"
let's
turn
on
the
television.
let's
turn
onto
that
fake
nbc
"news.\""
and
i
see
we
have
a
storm.
"\"okay,"
first
"lady,"
don't
worry
about
it.
the
storm
is
big.
we
have
it
taken
care
"of,"
fema's
down
"there,"
"florida,"
"alabama,"
georgia.
we
got
fema
down
there.
it's
being
taken
care
of.
we
always
take
care
of
it.
we
take
good
care
of
"it.\""
"texas,"
louisiana.
we
took
good
care
of
him
two
weeks
ago.
"\"all"
right
first
"lady,"
don't
worry
about
it.
it's
the
next
"story,"
i'm
"sure,"
it's
the
nobel
prize
for
"peace.\""
we're
stopping
mass
killings
between
kosovo
and
serbia.
they've
been
killing
each
other
for
so
"many,"
they're
going
to
stop
killing.
i
"said,"
"fellas,"
let's
get
together.
they'd
been
doing
it
for
hundreds
of
"years,"
"frankly,"
under
different
names.
i
"said,"
that's
great.
and
with
"israel,"
uae
and
bahrain
signed
a
deal
with
israel.
everybody
said
it
couldn't
be
done.
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
first
"lady,"
that's
the
first
story
on
"nbc,"
but
don't
worry.
that's
a
big
story.
the
floods
are
big.
i
see
"it.\""
and
then
there
was
a
second
story
about
something.
and
then
their
third
story
is
about
something
with
"me,"
i
don't
"know,"
something
bad
they
found
out.
then
there
was
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
and
a
sixth.
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
i'm
a
little
embarrassed.
i
thought
we'd
do
a
little
"better.\""
and
then
they
looked
at
the
"screen,"
and
"said,"
"\"good"
"night.\""
and
i
wasn't
covered.
i
got
the
nobel
peace
prize
"nomination,"
a
peace
"prize,"
nobel
nomination.
and
they
didn't
cover
it.
and
then
the
following
day
i
watched
a
certain
show
that
does
like
"us,"
and
they
"said,"
"\"would"
you
"believe,"
that
they
"covered,"
and
they
mentioned
like
five
subjects
that
were
nothing.
that
was
18
minutes.
and
the
peace
prize
nobel
"version,"
zero
time
for
president
trump.
thank
you
very
much
fake
news
"media,"
we
appreciate
it.
and
when
obama
got
"it,"
here
are
the
headlines.
president
obama
gets
the
nobel
prize.
we
need
an
honest
media.
the
free
"airwaves,"
they
lie
over
the
free
airwaves.
they
use
them
and
they
lie.
i
don't
know.
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
it.
they're
a
bunch
of
scoundrels.
they
hate
it
when
i
say
"it,"
but
you
"know,"
"honestly,"
they
are
the
enemy
of
the
people.
when
they
"lie,"
they
are
the
enemy
of
the
people.
you
are
the
enemy
of
the
people.
"oh,"
damn
it.
the
red
lights
just
went
off.
"one,"
"two,"
"three,"
there's
one
back
"there,"
there's
one
back
"there,"
"probably,"
oh
it's
"oan,"
thank
you
oan.
every
time
i
get
on
this
"subject,"
they
cover
me
not
because
they
want
"to,"
but
we
get
great
ratings.
we
get
ratings.
these
little
deals
that
we
have
"here,"
come
on
in
"folks,"
come
on
in.
look
at
these
people.
but
you
know
what?
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
it's
true.
they
cover
it
because…
but
anytime
i
start
talking
about
the
fake
news
"media,"
you
see
them
getting
a
little
tentative.
the
camera
starts
to
shake
a
little
"bit,"
and
you
"know,"
there's
another
thing.
look
at
this
crowd.
it's
as
far
as
the
eye
can
"see,"
it's
a
big
"crowd,"
right?
they
never
cover
it.
i
said
to
my
wife
last
"night,"
we
had
this
incredible
crowd.
a
lot
of
"people,"
thousands
and
thousands.
i
mean
like
"25,"
"30,000,"
many
people
outside
couldn't
get
it.
it
was
like
a
sea
of
people.
my
wife
"said,"
"\"was"
it
a
large
"crowd?\""
i
"said,"
"\"did"
you
"watch?\""
"\"yes."
but
they
only
show
your
"face.\""
and
i
saw
people
they
never
show.
and
that
includes
"fox,"
which
has
changed
a
"lot,"
changed
a
"lot,"
sad.
somebody
"said,"
"\"what's"
the
biggest
difference
between
2016
and
"now?\""
you
know
what
i
"said,"
"\"fox.\""
biggest
difference.
biggest
difference.
i
don't
know
what's
going
on
with
them.
but
we
have
some
great
ones
too
on
fox.
we
surged
rapid
testing
kits
to
every
nursing
home
in
america.
we
learned
a
"lot,"
through
pioneering
"therapies,"
we
reduced
the
fatality
rate
by
85%
since
april.
think
of
that?
85%.
we've
come
up
with
things.
they're
waiting
to
see
what's
coming
over
the
next
few
months
in
terms
of
"therapeutics,"
which
to
me
is
even
more
important
than
the
vaccine.
you
go
into
the
"hospital,"
you
make
people
better.
you
give
them
a
"shot,"
you
do
a
transfusion.
you
make
people
better.
they
walk
"out,"
that's
to
me
even
"better,"
but
ultimately
"long-term,"
those
vaccines
are
going
to
be
"great,"
and
they're
really
working
out
well
and
it's
going
to
be
really
soon.
the
people
in
certain
groups
are
trying
to
hold
them
up
as
long
as
"possible,"
as
long
as
possible.
they're
going
to
try
and
give
sleepy
joe
the
credit.
he
doesn't
even
know
what
a…
it's
possible.
they're
going
to
try
and
get
sleepy
joe
the
credit.
he
doesn't
even
know
what
a
vaccine
is.
europe
is
almost
30%
higher
excess
mortality
than
the
united
states.
does
anyone
know
that?
they
don't
report
"that,"
right?
europe?
europe's
had
a
hard
time.
i'm
not
looking
to
hurt
"them,"
but
they
have
30%
higher.
our
bold
and
early
action
saved
millions
of
lives
and
our
decisive
economic
response
saved
tens
of
millions
of
"jobs,"
including
1.3
million
"jobs,"
and
a
wonderful
place
called
north
"carolina,"
right?
when
i
banned
travel
from
china
in
"january,"
sleepy
joe
biden
called
"it,"
"\"that's"
hysterical.
that's
"xenophobic.\""
what
does
that
mean?
tell
me
what
xenophobic
"means,"
sleepy
joe.
who
said
that?
i
"mean,"
you're
my
friend.
who
said
it?
all
"right,"
what
a
voice.
have
you
ever
tried
opera?
what
a
"voice,"
did
everybody
hear
that?
that's
true.
i
wouldn't
say
it.
she
"said,"
"\"he"
has
no
idea
where
he
"is.\""
but
i
would
never
say
it.
i
won't
say
it.
i
won't
say
it.
i
refuse
this.
"no,"
but
don't
underestimate
him.
"look,"
he's
been
doing
this
for
47
"years,"
and
i
got
a
debate
coming
up
with
this
guy.
"no,"
it's
true.
you
never
"know,"
you
never
know.
they
give
him
a
big
fat
shot
in
the
"ass,"
and
he
comes
"out,"
and
for
two
"hours,"
he's
better
than
ever
before.
problem
is
what
happens
after
the
…
"no,"
we're
going
to
ask
for
a
drug
"test,"
we
are.
i'd
like
to
have
a
drug
test.
both
of
us.
i'll
take
"it,"
he'll
take.
because
i
watched
him
into
debates
with
all
those
"people,"
those
democrats.
the
one
who
treated
him
worst
was
kamala.
"actually,"
"also,"
she
was
the
one
that
"treated,"
you
know
"that,"
she
was
the
one
that
treated
him
so
badly.
and
she
treated
kavanaugh
very
badly
too.
nobody
was
ever
"ruder,"
nobody
ever
"suffered,"
like
justice
kavanaugh
suffered
in
the
hands
and
the
mouths
of
those
horrible
people.
the
way
he
was
tortured
was
disgraced.
and
they
had
nothing.
those
"women,"
that
was
all
made
up.
most
of
them
have
already
"admitted,"
it
was
all
made
up
"lies,"
false
"accusations,"
and
they
made
him
suffer.
and
the
leader
of
the
pack
i
would
say
"was,"
kamala
was
the
"worst,"
and
pocahontas
was
a
close
second.
how's
pocahontas
"doing,"
since
she
destroyed
bloomberg?
how
about
bloomberg?
did
he
get
killed?
now
he's
trying
to
come
back.
he's
trying
to
buy
his
way
back
into
the
democratic
party.
"\"i'm"
going
to
put
up
$100
million
in
"florida,"
we're
going
to
"go,\""
he
wants
to
be
back
so
badly.
here's
a
guy
who
spent
$2
"billion,"
it's
almost
two
billion
"now,"
they're
finding
out.
he
had
some
of
the
dumbest
"advisers,"
people
i
"know,"
some
of
the
dumbest
people.
if
he
would
have
just
kept
spending
a
couple
of
hundred
million
dollars
a
week
on
"ads,"
he
could
have
won.
he
could
have
won.
"unfortunately,"
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
want
to
"debate.\""
he
went
and
sued
to
get
into
the
debates.
that
was
not
a
good
lawsuit.
they
settled
by
"saying,"
"\"we'll"
let
you
in
the
"debate.\""
the
first
"question,"
he
was
destroyed.
you
would
think
"that,"
the
way
the
democrats
treated
"him,"
he
would
really
come
to
"me,"
and
he'd
"say,"
"\"i"
want
"you,\""
but
his
hatred
and
jealousy
…
he
wanted
to
be
"president,"
but
he
doesn't
have
the
capability
of
being
president.
but
he's
going
down
now
to
"florida,"
he's
going
to
spend
$100
million.
how
good
…
i
have
to
say
"this,"
i'm
not
a
fan
of
elizabeth
warren.
i
gave
her
the
name
"pocahontas,"
i
thought
that
was
the
end.
remember
what
i
used
to
say
about
her?
she
has
…
"oh,"
"well,"
you
know
it.
you
know.
i
would
"just,"
"look,"
i
"said,"
"\"this"
is
not
an
"indian.\""
she
"said,"
"\"i'm"
an
"indian.\""
you
remember
what
i
said?
"\"i"
have
more
indian
blood
than
"me,"
i
have
more
in
me
than
she
"has,"
and
i
have
"none.\""
"unfortunately,"
i'd
like
to
have
some.
i
would
like
to
have
some.
i
think
it
could
"help,"
it
might
make
me
"better,"
but
i
have
none.
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
have
more
than
she
"does.\""
and
then
she
went
out
"to,"
and
she
"choked,"
remember
that?
she
went
"out,"
and
she
took
a
test.
and
it
found
out
that
about
700
years
"ago,"
there
was
a
possible
"event,"
"1,024th,"
right?
wasn't
that
it?
good
"memory,"
very
good
memory.

has
a
good

good
moment.
not
for
"that,"
but
for
a
lot
of
things.
"now,"
"1024th,"
which
meant
"many,"
"many,"
many
centuries
"ago,"
there
could
have
been
a
hookup
somewhere
along
the
line.
but
she
choked.
we
forced
her
into
a
choke.
she
went
down
like
a
"rock,"
and
then
she
started
coming
"up,"
"up,"
"up,"
"up,"
up.
then
she
totally
destroyed
mike
bloomberg.
we
call
him
mini
mike.
remember?
mini
mikey
wants
that
platform.
"\"i"
want
a
"platform,"
damn
"it.\""
i
don't
mind.
"oh,"
"boy,"
he
was
"pathetic,"
but
now
he's
going
to
try
and
buy
his
way
back
into
the
democrat
party.
you
remember
that
guy?
great
environmentalist.
except
he
made
his
money
with
"coal,"
which
is
"okay,"
i
think
coal
is
good.
clean
"coal,"
i
like
clean
coal.
if
we
had
listened
to
joe
"biden,"
hundreds
of
thousands
more
americans
would
have
died.
you
know
that.
he
was
way
behind.
this
was
months
later.
and
then
i
watch
him
last
"night,"
reading
something
saying
"that,"
i
"opened,"
i
closed
it
"up,"
one
week
"later,"
one
week.
two
months
"later,"
he
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
i
shouldn't
be
doing
that
to
china.
i
shouldn't
be
banning
china
because
i
was
xenophobic.
and
it's
just
unbelievable.
and
now
they
will
say
anything.
it's
called
disinformation.
they
will
make
up
a
"lie,"
they
will
make
up
a
"story,"
and
they
go
with
"it,"
it
makes
no
difference
whether
or
not
it's
"show,"
and
they'll
take
ads.
it's
the
worst
group
of
people.
he's
surrounded
by
bad
"people,"
dishonest
"people,"
but
they're
very
smart.
he's
not
smart.
they
keep
him
from
talking.
it's
"actually,"
if
he
"wins,"
it's
the
single
most
brilliant
campaign
in
the
history
of
the
world.
because
they
took
a
man
who's
got
nothing.
he
didn't
have
"it,"
but
he's
got
"nothing,"
and
i
will
give
them
credit.
the
single
greatest
campaign
in
"history,"
if
he
"wins,"
but
you
know
what?
if
he
"wins,"
north
carolina
is
"screwed,"
and
so
is
every
place
else.
and
you
can
forget
your
tobacco
"industry,"
you
can
forget
your
farmers.
i
gave
the
farmers
$28
billion.
thank
you
very
"much,"
presidency.
$28
billion.
because
you
were
"targeted,"
right?
you
were
targeted
by
china.
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
were
the
"farmers,\""
"iowa,"
"nebraska,"
"you,"
all
of
them?
you
were
targeted.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
"much?\""
sonny
"perdue,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
"much,"
"secretary?\""
12
"billion,"
then
16
"billion,"
you
were
targeted.
i
took
it
out
of
the
tariffs
we
charge.
we
never
took
25
cents
in
from
"china,"
now
we're
getting
billions
and
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
sleepy
"joe,"
that
never
"gave,"
never
took
"anything,"
or
"trump,"
misjudging
him?
so
"mexico,"
we're
driving
them
a
little
crazy.
they
don't
like
trump
too
much.
but
now
biden
is
recklessly
campaigning
against
his
vaccine.
his
campaign
campaign's
really
reckless.
and
all
it
is
is
for
political
reasons.
it's
political
reasons.
"biden,"
his
whole
deal
is
catastrophic
shutdown.
we're
getting
"better,"
we're
really
coming
"along,"
and
he's
talking
about
shutting
down.
we're
not
doing
any
shutdowns.
we
don't
need
shutdowns.
maybe
a
little
"area,"
if
it's
such
a
"spike,"
we
"understand,"
we
have
to
take
care
of
our
senior
citizens.
this
guy
"talked,"
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
i'll
do
whatever
my
medical
people
want.
i
believe
in
"science.\""
he
doesn't
know
what
science
is.
"\"i"
believe
in
"science.\""
"no,"
we're
not
doing
any
shutdowns.
we
don't
"need,"
we're
rounding
the
turn.
without
the
"vaccine,"
we're
rounding
the
turn.
with
the
"vaccine,"
it'll
just
speed
it
up.
that's
another
one
that
will
be
controversial.
they'll
"say,"
"\"he's"
saying
that
it's
"happened.\""
"yeah,"
without
the
"care,"
without
the
"vaccine,"
it's
going
along.
with
a
"vaccine,"
even
better.
it'll
be
faster.
biden's
own
chief
of
staff
"said,"
when
they
manage
the
h1n1
that
he
calls
the
"n1h1,"
right?
he
"goes,"
"\"the"
"n1h1,\""
and
that's
an
easy
"one,"
because
h
comes
"before,"
but
he
always
gets
it
wrong.
it's
"like,"
seven
"times,"
"\"it's"
great
to
be
with
the
great
people
of
"iowa.\""
they'll
"say,"
"\"sir,"
you're
in
"idaho.\""
"\"oh.\""
i've
never
made
that
mistake
so
far.
but
i
always
"say,"
"\"if"
you
"do,"
just
leave
the
"stage,"
because
you
can
never
"recover.\""
you
can
speak
as
well
"as,"
i
"mentioned,"
winston
"churchill,"
even
though
he
was
a
great
"speaker,"
he
was
a
"stutterer,"
and
he
became
one
of
the
greatest
speakers
ever.
you
could
be
winston
"churchill,"
if
you
make
that
"mistake,"
just
leave
the
stage.
you
can't
recover.
but
he's
made
it
"oftentimes,"
"right,"
in
new
"hampshire,"
and
it
was
vermont.
the
"worst,"
i
"think,"
i
think
there
was
"one,"
he
was
in
"ohio,"
and
he
said
he
was
in
"florida,"
right?
but
he
couldn't
find
any
palm
trees.
we
just
got
a
poll
from
ohio.
through
the
roof.
great
state
of
"ohio,"
good
"governor,"
great
state
of
ohio.
but
when
they
managed
the
h1n1
swine
"flu,"
this
was
from
his
top
person
that
ran
it.
"\"we"
did
every
possible
thing
wrong.
60
million
americans
got
h1n1
in
that
period
of
time.
and
it
was
just
a
total
"disaster.\""
he
basically
"said,"
"\"we"
didn't
know
what
the
hell
we
were
"doing.\""
and
this
is
the
guy
that's
going
to
tell
us
what
to
do
with
something
that's
much
more
"lethal,"
much
more
lethal.
this
is
much
more
lethal
than
the
swine
flu.
if
h1n1
had
the
same
fatality
rate
as
the
china
"virus,"
over
two
million
people
would
have
already
perished.
they
didn't
know
what
the
hell
they
were
doing.
and
the
guy
admitted
it.
that
guy
can
not
be
very
popular
in
democrat
politics
right
there.
but
just
to
"remember,"
and
he's
telling
us
how
to
do
things.
we're
building
"ventilators,"
we're
the
ventilator
capital
of
the
world
"now,"
think
of
it.
we're
sending
them
to
other
"countries,"
we
have
so
many.
and
we
have
made
a
lot
of
governors
look
very
good.
and
they
all
admit
"it,"
until
the
press
comes
in
"front,"
where
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
he
was
"okay,\""
but
we
took
care
of
them.
we
took
care
of
"governors,"
we
took
care
of
the
states.
on
november
"3rd,"
north
carolina
will
decide
whether
we
will
quickly
return
to
record
"prosperity,"
or
whether
we
allow
joe
biden
to
impose
a
$4
trillion
tax
"hike,"
ban
american
"energy,"
confiscate
your
guns.
these
are
all
things
that
he
said.

down

they
were
saying
that

in
the
"suburbs,"
they're
not

they're
starting

"no,"
it's

i
don't

but
i
heard
the
same
thing
four
years
"ago,"
remember?
"\""
women
will
not
vote

then
we
win
the
"election,"

all
in

"well,"
what
took
place?
"\"well,"
he
did
very
well
with
"women,\""
what
the
hell
was
that
all
"about,"
right?
did
very
well.

"now,"
if

…
there
a

wants
to
give

"now,"
what
that's
going

is
destroy

we
can't

done.
biden's
running
mate
urged
supporters
to
help
bail
rioters
out
of
"jail,"
including
one
who
attempted
murder.
that's
right.
one
who
attempted
to
murder
a
police
"officer,"
and
a
man
accused
of
sexually
assaulting
an
eight-year-old
"girl,"
13
members
of
biden's
staff
donated
to
the
same
fund.
"look,"
that's
where
they're
coming
"from,"
just
so
you
know.
he's
trying
to
go
a
little
bit
more
"right,"
like
the
fracking.
"\"oh,"
well
of
"course,"
we're
going
to
have
"…\""
for
six
"months,"
he's
"saying,"
there'll
be
no
"fracking,"
which
i
don't
think
the
people
in
pennsylvania
thrilled
"with,"
do
you
"agree,"
considering
that
your
taxes
could
quadruple.
i
tell
it
all
the
"time,"
"texas,"
right?
"texas,"
they
like
oil.
they
like
"guns,"

right?
and
they
like

so
he
comes
out
with

no

we
don't

this
is
during

deal.
there'll
be
no
"oil,"
there'll
be
no
"god,"
there'll
be
no
guns.
this
is
not
a
good
campaign.
and
then
the
fake
news
"says,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
tied
in

i'm
tied.
last
time
i
was
tied
in

what

everything's
"closed,"

that's
why
i
say
everything

is
a
protest.

at

those

back
"there,"
look
at

look
"it,"

i
"say,"
"\"turn"
the

right
from
the
"beginning,"
they
never
did.
they
don't
want
to
give
us
the
credit
for
these
big
"crowds,"
because
you
know
what?
when
you
see
crowds
like
"this,"
or
in
"wisconsin,"
that
i
had
a
few
nights
"ago,"
or
last
night
was
so
incredible.
what
we
had
last

was
just
"incredible,"

"\"why?"

no
nothing.
they
called
it
a

right?
right
off
their
shore.
"maine,"
i
"mean,"
if
i
don't
win
maine
…
maine
traditionally
is
not
really
very
"republican,"
but
i
won
maine
too
last
"time,"
actually.
because
i
love
"maine,"
too.
i
love
"maine,"

but
think
of
what
i
did.
i
opened
the
waters
up
for
fishermen
and
for
lobster
men
and
women.
now
they
go
lobster
fishing
and
fishing.
but
"5,"
"000,"
i
"said,"
"\"why"
did
they
close
"it?\""
nobody
was
able
to
tell
"me,"
but
i
opened
it
"up,"
an
executive
order.
i
totally
opened
it
up.
i
did
many
other
things.
then
i
got
the
tariffs.
they
couldn't
do
business
in
european
"union,"
they
couldn't
do
business
in
"china,"
because
they
were
charging
tariffs
to
maine.
so
canada
would
take
our
fish
and
lobster.
we'd
sell
it
to
canada
for
"nothing,"
and
they'd
sell
it
to
china
and
"europe,"
because
they
didn't
have
to
pay
tariffs.
not
only
did
i
get
the
"5,000"
…
think
of
"what,"
"5,000"
square
miles.
so
you
take
one
"mile,"
square
"mile,"
multiply
times
"5,000."
that's
a
big
"area,"
even
in
an
"ocean,"
right?
it's
massive.
and
it
was
the
best
"area,"
the
best.
i
got
rid
of
the
tariffs.
i
told
"them,"
"\"if"
you
tariff
our
maine
lobster
"people,"
and
fishermen
and
"women,"
if
you
want
a
tariff
on
"them,"
that's
"okay,"
but
we're
going
to
tariff
your
"cars,"
"okay?\""
which
is
a
much
bigger
deal.
it
was
amazing
how
quickly
those
tariffs
were
taken
off.
i
did
that
off
of
"maine,"
i
did
that
in
two
"weeks,"
okay?
took
me
two
weeks.
once
i
found
out
about
"it,"
it's
hard
to
believe
it
ever
happened.
so
i
did
that
for
maine.
and
somebody
"said,"
i'm
down
in
maine.
how
the
hell
can
i
be
down
in
"maine,"
after
what
i
did?
i'll
tell
you
what
if
i
do
that
from
"maine,"
and
if
maine
doesn't
vote
for
trump.
i
don't
think
i'm
going
"back,"
okay?
i
can
tell
you
one
thing.
their
senator
never
did
it
for
them.
joe
biden
and
the
democrats
want
to
gut
police
departments
nationwide.
you
know
"that,"
right?
here
in
north
"carolina,"
nearly
50
democrat
state
house
members
and
candidates
have
signed
a
pledge
to
slash
police
"funding,"
endangering
your
families.
i
was
recently
honored
to
be
endorsed
by
54
sheriffs
throughout
this
"state,"
and
we're
joined
by
many
of
them
tonight.
where
are
they?
thank
"you,"
sheriff.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
folks.
thank
you.
thank
you.
you
got
to
take
care
of
our
law
enforcement.
we
got
to
take
"care,"
nobody
can
do
the
job
like
them.
we
have
to
let
them
do
their
job.
we've
got
to
stop
this
"nonsense,"
this
child's
"play,"
we've
got
to
"stop,"
they're
great.
you
"know,"
i
was
endorsed
"by,"
think
of
"this,"
new
york's
finest.
it's
very
tough.
you
"know,"
de
blasio's
your
"mayor,"
he
doesn't
have
a
clue
what's
"happening,"
either.
i
think
sleepy
joe's
"worse,"
do
you
want
to
know
the
truth?
because
this
other
guy
has
just
an
ideology
that's
just
terrible.
but
de
blasio
is
"there,"
and
new
york's
"finest,"
first
time
they've
ever
endorsed
a
presidential
"candidate,"
they
endorsed
"me,"
three
weeks
ago.
that
takes
courage.
think
of
it.
"chicago,"
the
police
in
"chicago,"
they
could
do
their
job.
we
don't
even
have
to
bring
in
the
national
guard.
whenever
we
"do,"
it
takes
about
30
"minutes,"
it's
"over,"
right?
like
we
did
in
"minneapolis,"
30
minutes.
remember
that
beautiful
scene?
they
lined
"up,"
they
went
"down,"
there
was
no
social
distancing
in
between
these
"great,"
tough
guys.
there
was
no
social
"distancing,"
tom
tillis.
they
went
down
and
they
had
"$250,000"
outfits.
they
had
more
crap
on
that
helmet
with
night
goggles.
and
these
guys
were
sort
of
wise
"guys,"
right?
they
were
shouting
at
"them,"
screaming
at
them.
they
were
screaming
at
the
wrong
people.
they
went
"down,"
they
never
had
to
stop.
it
was
just
forward.
it
all
ended.
it
all
ended
in
minneapolis.
it
"took,"
you
also
"had,"
what?
a
half
an
hour?
"remember,"
they
hit
the
cnn
reporter
in
the
knee?
he
went
"down,"
ali
velshi.
he
"said,"
"\"this"
is
a
friendly
protest.
it's
wonderful
to
see
such
a
"…\""
behind
"him,"
it
was
all
fire
for
a
block.
it
looked
like
berlin
during
the
war.
"\"this"
is
a
friendly
"…\""
what
are
they
doing?
how
does
that
help
to
be
like
that?
how
does
that
help?
we're
joined
tonight
by
some
really
great
friends
of
mine
and
some
warriors
that
have
been
a
fantastic
help
to
me.
one
man
"who,"
especially
over
the
last
"year,"
he
has
been
so
"great,"
he
couldn't
be
better.
and
i
think
he's
doing
very
well.
i'm
looking
at
some
"numbers,"
and
you're
doing
very
well.
and
i
think
your
opponent
has
some
very
big
problems.
senator
tom
tillis.
thank
"you,"
tom.
thank
you.
he's
been
"great,"
smart
guy.
and
he's
got
a
couple
of
bills
that
he's
putting
"in,"
one
in
"particular,"
i
love
it.
you
got
to
do
it.
that
if
a
sanctuary
city
causes
"problems,"
you
can
sue
the
sanctuary
"city,"
you
can
sue.
will
you
"get,"
we
got
to
get
that
one
"moving,"
right?
that's
moving
"along,"
right?
that's
a
great
one.
a
man
"who,"
i
just
did
a
phone
call
for
the
other
"night,"
and
the
people
love
him.
he's
in
a
rough
"district,"
but
he's
now
leading.
i
see
you're
up
in
the
"polls,"
congressman
richard
"hudson,"
great
guy.
where's
richard?
great
guy.
he's
a
warrior.
and
two
people
i
really
"liked,"
because
we
fought
like
hell
for
them
a
year
"ago,"
right?
and
they
had
"guts,"
and
they
had
what
it
takes.
they
didn't
choke.
you
"know,"
a
lot
of
people
choke.
they
"choke,"
they
"gag,"
they
can't
breathe.
greg
murphy
and
dan
"bishop,"
they
didn't
"choke,"
they're
fantastic.
they
are
fantastic
people.
thank
you.
"look,"
they're
friends.
we're
friends.
those
two
guys
were
incredible.
thank
you
very
"much,"
great
job.
really
great
job.
and
a
man
that
should
be
your
"governor,"
i
don't
"know,"
he's
doing
"well,"
but
lieutenant
"governor,"
dan
"forest,"
everybody.
thank
you
very
"much,"
great
job.
handsome
"guy,"
handsome.
looks
like
cary
grant.
i
hear
you're
doing
really
well.
"look,"
i
"mean,"
this
guy's
got
this
state
totally
closed
down.
it's
ridiculous.
"it's,"
when
are
they
going
to
open?
when
are
they
going
to
open?
"dan,"
this
would
have
been
opened
up
a
long
time
ago.
and
you
would
have
done
even
better.
i
"mean,"
you
would
have
done
better.
and
north
carolina
republican
party
"chair,"
michael
whatley.
michael?
thank
"you,"
michael.
great
"job,"
michael.
how
are
we
"doing,"
michael?
how's
it
going?
are
we
up?
i
"mean,"
if
i
lose
north
"carolina,"
i'm
getting
out
of
here.
this
is
not
…
look
at
that.
this
is
"not,"
just
so
you
"know,"
the
crowd
of
a
man
that's
coming
in
second.
i
say
it
all
the
time.
i
said
it
when
i
left
michigan.
"2016,"
the
night
of
the
"election,"
we
had
"32,000"
people.
hillary
was
"there,"
just
before
"me,"
in
a
prime
location.
she
had
about
400
people.
i
got
there
at
12
in
the
"evening,"
i
started
speaking
at
one
in
the
"morning,"
it's
now
election
"day,"
and
i
left.
"32,000"
"people,"
we
had
"32,000"
people.
so
it's
now
election
day.
i
start
"speaking,"
i
started
"speaking,"
think
of
"it,"
one
o'clock
in
the
"morning,"
we
had
"30,"
you
never
saw
anything
like
it.
i
left.
i
"said,"
"\"that"
doesn't
look
like
we're
going
to
lose
"michigan.\""
and
guess
what?
we
didn't.
we
won
"michigan,"
first
time
in
decades.
and
you
know
what
we've
done?
"many,"
many
car
plants
are
now
opening
up.
a
great
"gentleman,"
who's
just
"retiring,"
prime
minister
"abe,"
of
japan.
i
"said,"
"\"shinzo,"
please
do
me
a
favor.
we
need
more
car
companies.
you're
selling
cars
into
our
"country,"
please.
we
want
to
build
"here,"
not
in
"japan,"
"please.\""
he
"said,"
"\"but"
we
cannot
do
that.
this
is
a
free
enterprise
"system.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
"know,"
"shinzo,"
please.
i
need
some
car
companies.
please
do
"it.\""
"\"i"
can't
do
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"shinzo,"
you
have
to
do
"it.\""
next
"day,"
it
was
a
"story,"
"\"five"
car
companies
to
open
up
in
"michigan,\""
right?
so
much
for
free
"enterprise,"
but
he's
a
great
"guy,"
he's
a
friend
of
mine.
he's
great.
they're
lucky
he's
a
friend
of
mine.
i
would
have
been
much
tougher.
it's
hard.
when
a
guy
is
a
"friend,"
it's
"hard,"
but
they
did
a
lot.
they
did
a
lot.
they
helped
it
a
lot.
and
what
they've
done
"here,"
by
the
"way,"
"japan,"
and
what
they've
done
in
"michigan,"
"ohio,"
what
they've
done?
by
the
"way,"
we
all
love
south
"carolina,"
"right,"
right?
i
think
we
love
it.
"now,"
south
"carolina,"
we're
winning
"here,"
but
south
"carolina,"
i
hate
to
say
this
to
"you,"
i
don't
want
to
make
you
upset.
we're
winning
by
about
400
points.
i
spoke
to
a
great
person
in
south
carolina
who
"said,"
"\"sir,"
you
don't
have
to
come
here.
this
thing's
up
by
a
"lot.\""
what
the
hell
is
the
"difference,"
right?
i
"mean,"
we
are
"up,"
and
we're
up
"good,"
but
i'd
love
you
to
tie
south
carolina.
what
do
we
have
to
do?
but
a
lot
of
activity
in
south
carolina
"also,"
they're
doing
great.
you
had
the
best
year
you've
ever
had.
they've
had
the
best
year
they
ever
had.
and
you're
going
to
go
to
a
better
"year,"
we
are
going
to
have
a
better
year.
we're
also
deeply
honored
to
be
joined
by
a
military
"spouse,"
amy
"williams,"
who
was
reunited
with
her
"husband,"
sergeant
first
class
townsend
"williams,"
at
my
state
of
the
union
address.
everybody
remembers
that.
everybody
remembers
was
there.
"good,"
you're
looking
well.
thank
you
very
much.
say
hello
to
the
whole
family.
thank
you.
thanks
to
the
incredible
sacrifices
of
our
"warriors,"
and
they
are
warriors.
we're
pursuing
peace
in
"afghanistan,"
it's
very
close.
we're
down
"to,"
we
will
soon
be
down
to
"4,000"
soldiers.
we're
taking
them
out.
they're
serving
as
policemen.
they're
serving
as
"police,"
and
they've
done
a
great
job.
we
could
win
"everything,"
but
i'm
not
looking
to
kill
three
million
people
to
"win,"
what?
to
win
what?
we
should
have
never
been
in
the
middle
"east,"
and
we're
bringing
them
back.
we're
bringing
them
"back,"
just
so
you
"know,"
we're
bringing
them
back
from
iraq.
we're
down
to
"2,000"
soldiers
in
iraq.
and
in
"syria,"
we're
all
"back,"
we're
all
"finished,"
except
for
one
thing.
if
it's
okay
with
you.
i
decided
to
keep
the
oil.
we
took
the
"oil,"
we
kept
it.
and
we'll
always
support
america's
incredible
military
families.
so
thank
you
very
much.
thank
"you,"
darling.
really
good.
okay.
in
everything
we
"do,"
we're
putting
america
"first,"
unlike
other
"administrations,"
and
not
just
obama
and
biden.
this
has
gone
on
for
many
years.
we
put
america
"first,"
and
that's
what
we're
doing.
and
you
know
what?
other
"countries,"
for
the
first
time
in
"decades,"
respect
us
again.
remember
that.
they
respect
us
again.
you
know
all
about
"data,"
28
countries.
we
had
six
countries
that
were
"current,"
and
the
amount
of
current
is
too
"low,"
okay?
six
countries.
i
went
"in,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
pay.
"sorry,"
you're
"delinquent.\""
they
"said,"
"\"really?\""
"\"yeah,\""
i
said.
"\"you're"
delinquent.
you
got
to
"pay.\""
obama
would
"go,"
and
make
a
speech
and
"leave,"
that
would
be
it.
we
were
paying
for
it.
we're
protecting
"europe,"
and
they're
screwing
us
on
trade.
so
we
protect
"them,"
and
they're
screwing
us
on
trade.
no
"good,"
no
good.
can't
do
it.
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
"unfair.\""
and
the
secretary
"general,"
"stoltenberg,"
of
"nato,"
"said,"
"\"i've"
never
"seen,\""
and
the
fake
news
can
call
him
up
and
check.
he
"said,"
"\"he's"
the
greatest
that
we've
ever
"seen.\""
for
20
"years,"
the
spending
at
nato
went
like
"this,"
right?
and
"america,"
we
pick
it
up.
every
time
it
goes
"down,"
they
didn't
pay.
and
i
"said,"
"\"we're"
supposed
to
protect
you.
you're
going
to
be
attacked
by
russia
or
"somebody,"
we're
supposed
to
protect
you.
and
yet
you're
delinquent.
you
don't
pay
your
"bills.\""
and
that
includes
germany.
they're
paying
"1%,"
they're
supposed
to
pay
"two,"
and
2%
is
way
too
low.
2%
military
spending.
so
we
"got,"
listen
to
this.
it
never
gets
reported
by
these
fakers.
we
got
$130
million
"more,"
"more,"
not
"total,"
"more,"
going
"to,"
over
three
"years,"
$400
billion.
so
we're
going
from
130
"billion,"
with
a
"b,"
not
"million,"
to
$400
billion.
and
they
said
to
"me,"
they
said
…
and
they
said
to
"me,"
they
said
to
"me,"
very
nice
"guy,"
head
of
one
of
the
"countries,"
at
a
table.
i
can't
believe
it
never
got
"released,"
but
now
we
can
talk
about
"it,"
because
it's
three
years
ago.
but
they
"said,"
"\"sir"
…
"\""
and
this
was
a
big
private
meeting
of
all
of
the
"nations,"
"\"does"
that
mean
if
we
don't
…
"\""
because
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
pay
your
bills.
we're
protecting
you.
you're
not
paying
your
"bills.\""
some
"did,"
like
poland
and
some
"others,"
but
most
didn't.
six
to
eight
were
"current,"
and
we
were
paying
much
more
than
we
should
have
been
"paying,"
much
more.
i
"mean,"
it's
europe.
we
got
to
defend
"ourself,"
and
there
was
no
guarantee
that
they'd
help
us
if
we
ever
had
a
problem.
right?
we're
never
going
to
have
a
problem.
we
got
so
much
stuff
now.
we
were
depleted.
now
we
have
great
…
but
they
said
to
"me,"
"\"does"
this
mean
…
"\""
and
i
had
to
give
this
answer.
i
can't
believe
it
didn't
get
leaked
by
some
sleazebag.
we
have
leakers
all
over
this
"place,"
but
a
lot
of
it
didn't
leak.
a
lot
of
it
is
just
made
up
by
the
newspapers.
they
make
up
phony
stories.
they
"say,"
"\"donald"
trump
woke
up
today.
he
was
in
a
very
bad
"mood,"
according
to
"sources.\""
there
is
no
source.
they
just
made
it
up.
"hey,"
i
woke
"up,"
and
i
was
in
a
bad
mood.
true.
i've
actually
had
a
…
i've
been
in
a
good
"mood,"
because
we're
doing
so
much
for
our
country.
we've
done
so
much
for
our
country.
but
at
the
nato
"meeting,"
one
of
the
presidents
of
one
of
the
good
"countries,"
all
"good,"
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
does
this
mean
that
if
we
don't
"pay,"
does
this
mean
that
you're
going
to
"leave,"
and
you're
not
going
to
protect
"us?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yes."
that's
what
it
means.
i'm
"sorry.\""
it
was
an
amazing
"effect,"
because
other
presidents
"said,"
"\"no."
we
will
always
protect
you.
we
will
always
protect
"you,"
even
if
you
don't
"pay,"
even
if
our
taxpayer
is
paying
for
"everything,"
even
though
you
take
advantage
of
us
on
"trade,"
you
don't
let
our
cars
"in,"
you
don't
let
our
stuff
"in,"
but
you
sell
us
like
"crazy,"
even
though
you
tariff
our
"product,"
even
though
you
do
"everything,"
and
then
you
take
advantage
of
us
with
the
"military.\""
they
"said,"
"\"we"
will
always
protect
"you.\""
so
they
didn't
pay.
why
the
hell
would
they
pay?
they
"said,"
"\"boy,"
these
guys
are
"stupid.\""
so
they
asked
me
the
"question,"
"\"does"
this
"mean,"
"sir,"
that
you
will
not
protect
us
anymore
if
we
don't
"pay?\""
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
sorry
to
"say,"
it
"does.\""
that's
a
big
story.
three
years
"ago,"
it's
a
big
story.
it
was
amazing
how
the
money
came
in.
so
we
took
in
130
billion
a
"year,"
going
over
a
three-year
"period,"
to
"400,"
just
because
i
asked.
right?
just
because
i
asked.
true.
they
don't
report
that
story.
then
we
got
lightweights
that
i
"fired,"
and
they
write
books
about
"me,"
that
i'm
a
bad
"guy,"
"\"oh,"
he's
a
terrible
guy.
he
treats
our
allies
so
"badly.\""
no.
our
allies
treat
us
badly.
our
allies
in
many
ways
treat
us
worse
than
our
enemies.
i
must
be
honest
with
you.
they
take
advantage
of
us.
everyone
takes
advantage
of
your
"country,"
and
we
don't
put
up
with
it.
and
you
know
what
the
funny
thing?
we
get
along
better
"now,"
because
they
respect
us
again.
"before,"
they
thought
we
were
stupid.
they
respect
us
again.
they
do.
i
"mean,"
look
at
"israel,"
look
what
we
did.
i
saw
kerry
this
other
day.
is
this
guy
the
worst
negotiator?
gave
iran
150
"billion,"
plus
1.8
billion
in
cash.
he
never
walked.
sometimes
in
a
"negotiation,"
when
you've
given
"everything,"
and
you
can't
give
"anymore,"
and
then
they
want
"more,"
you
get
up
ane
walk.
remember
the
bicycle
accident?
that
was
the
only
time
he
had
to
ride
his
bicycle
in
a
race.
73
years
old.
"\"i"
"promise,\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
will
never
ever
…
i
promise
to
"you,"
ride
a
bicycle
in
a
"race,"
or
any
other
time
"frankly.\""
i
will
never
ride
a
bicycle
during
a
negotiation.
and
he
broke
his
"leg,"
and
his
"arm,"
and
he
was
all
screwed
up.
and
that
was
actually
a
good
"thing,"
because
it
delayed
the
signing
of
that
horrible
"deal,"
which
i
terminated.
"nah,"
we
had
some
terrible
"negotiators,"
and
they
all
"said,"
i
saw
them
the
other
"day,"
this
was
him
like
a
year
"ago,"
"\"mark"
my
"words,"
you
will
never
ever
sign
deals
with
arab
"countries,"
with
israel.
it
can't
be
"done.\""
"well,"
we
just
signed
the
two
great
"ones,"
and
we
got
about
seven
more
that
want
to
come
in.
what
a
"bunch,"
what
a
bunch.
and
then
they
say
bad
things
about
your
president.
they
don't
like
my
foreign
policy.
i
like
my
foreign
policy.
you
like
it.
"no,"
we
were
taken
advantage
of
by
the
whole
world.
they're
so
"stupid,"
so
stupid.
we've
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
damage
that
biden
and
his
crew
inflicted
on
us
over
a
47-year
period.
joe
biden
is
weak.
he's
supported
every
globalist
sellout
of
north
"carolina,"
the
"workers,"
what
he's
done.
and
when
i
"say,"
"\"him\","
it's
him
and
people
in
his
little
group
that
…
you've
achieved
so
much
over
a
period
of
time.
he
sold
it
out.
look
at
nafta.
how
bad
was
nafta?
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
organization.
tpp
would
have
destroyed
our
car
industry.
and
of
"course,"
he
joined
and
wanted
to
join
the
paris
climate
accord.
that's
another
beauty.
that
would
have
cost
you
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars.
that
was
"actually,"
i
"think,"
designed
to
put
us
out
of
"business,"
literally.
biden
has
repeatedly
surrendered
your
jobs
to
china
and
other
countries.
this
state
lost
43%
of
all
manufacturing
jobs
after
the
nafta
and
china
disasters.
you
know
that.
you
lost
"43%,"
but
i
think
the
real
number
is
"61%,"
by
the
way.
biden
says
that
this
an
election
between
scranton
and
park
avenue.
by
the
"way,"
he
left
scranton.
he
likes
to
"say,"
"\"i"
was
born
in
"pennsylvania.\""
but
he
doesn't
say
he
left.
his
father
left.
not
his
"fault,"
but
they
make
it
like
he's
…
"no,"
he
went
to
delaware.
he
doesn't
leave
"delaware,"
that
i
can
tell
you.
every
time
i
see
this
guy
…
"wilmington,"
delaware.
does
he
ever
leave?
i'm
in
los
angeles.
i'm
trying
to
work
on
the
fires.
they
ought
to
do
some
forest
management
a
little
bit
maybe.
ridiculous.
the
floors
of
the
"forest,"
it's
got
20
years
of
leaves
and
trees
that
are
dry
as
a
"bone,"
matchsticks.
forest
management.
"naturally,"
this
is
an
"election,"
not
between
scranton
or
wherever
it
is.
it's
really
between
scranton
and
"china,"
you
know
"that,"
scranton
and
china.
i'm
with
america.
biden
is
with
china.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
if
we
"win,"
america
"wins,"
north
carolina
"wins,"
pennsylvania
"wins,"
and
the
american
workers
win
in
every
single
state.
to
save
our
auto
"industry,"
i
withdrew
from
this
"horrible,"
horrible
"deal,"
trans-pacific
partnership.
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
to
north
carolina
when
i
ended
the
nafta
nightmare.
you
got
hit
so
hard.
all
those
empty
buildings
all
over
the
"place,"
but
a
lot
of
them
now
are
filled
up
because
of
us.
they
filled
up.
when
did
they
fill
up?
over
the
last
three-and-a-half
years.
i
proudly
signed
a
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
agreement
into
"law,"
which
will
bring
hundreds
of
thousands
of
high
paying
jobs
back
to
the
united
"states,"
and
it's
already
doing.
we
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military.
defense
spending
in
north
carolina
has
soared
by
more
than
$1
billion
a
year.
"congratulations,"
good
job.
we
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
us
armed
forces.
this
by
itself
would
be
a
big
achievement.
this
is
one
of
so
many
different
"things,"
right
to
"try,"
the
"military,"
the
"vets,"
everything.
we've
done
so
"much,"
but
we
…
75
"years,"
right?
last
one
was
the
air
force.
the
"army,"
the
"navy,"
the
air
"force,"
the
"marines,"
the
coast
"guard,"
they're
so
good.
we
have
another
one
"now,"
for
75
"years,"
space
force.
we
need
it.
i
never
even
promised
that.
right?
one
of
them
said
recently
"that,"
"\"he's"
actually
done
more
than
he
promised
in
the
"campaign.\""
that
means
i'm
probably
the
only
politician
in
history.
they
will
tell
"you,"
these
incredible
women
up
here
from
north
carolina.
stand
up.
will
"you,"
please?
these
are
most
incredible
people.
thank
you.
stand
up.
turn
around
for
the
"cameras,"
so
they
can
see
how
incredible
you
are.
thank
you.
"man,"
"oh,"
man.
what
a
life.
but
we
took
care
of
the
va
with
veterans
choice.
you
saw
that.
what
obama
was
nothing.
it
wasn't
"working,"
the
mission
act.
that's
amazing.
and
"accountability,"
where
we
can
fire
people
in
the
va
that
aren't
taking
great
care
of
our
"vets,"
okay?
"\"you're"
fired.
get
out.
you're
fired.
"out.\""
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdad.
we
took
out
the
worlds
number-one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murder
of
american
troops
and
many
"others,"
qasem
soleimani.
he's
dead.
he's
dead.
i
withdrew
from
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capitol
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
we
got
it
built.
i
was
signing
a
sheet
of
"paper,"
you've
heard
this
"story,"
$1.1
billion.
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
this
"for?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
now
that
you've
"moved,"
we're
going
to
build
an
embassy
in
"israel,"
in
"jerusalem.\""
i
"say,"
"\"how"
much
is
"it?\""
"\"1.1"
"billion.\""
you
got
some
friends
of
mine
"here,"
they're
builders.
you
don't
spend
1.1
billion
on
a
one-story
building.
i
don't
know
what's
going
on.
so
i
"said,"
"\"so,"
does
it
have
to
cost
so
"much?\""
"\"yes,"
sir.
we're
buying
"land\""
so
i
called
david
friedman.
he's
our
"ambassador,"
he's
one
of
the
most
successful
lawyers
in
new
york.
he's
a
brilliant
guy.
he
loves
israel.
right?
love
israel.
i
call
him.
he's
the
"ambassador,"
he's
there.
i
"said,"
"\"david,"
they
want
to
spend
1.1
billion
on
a
damn
one-story
embassy.
it's
"crazy.\""
i
"said,"
"\"would"
you
take
a
look?
maybe
we
own
some
"land.\""
we
own
a
lot
of
land.
we've
been
there
a
long
time.
calls
me
back.
he
"said,"
"\"let"
me
take
a
look
at
"it,"
"sir.\""
he
calls
me
the
next
day.
"\"sir,"
we
have
a
great
piece
of
"land,"
a
much
better
location
that
we
were
going
to
way
overpay
"for,"
a
much
bigger
piece.
we
have
a
setback
building
that
we
can
renovate
and
make
it
"great.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"fantastic,"
david.
how
much
will
it
cost
to
renovate
the
"building?\""
"\"i"
think
we
can
do
it
for
"$190,000.\""
so
i
"said,"
"\"david,\""
it's
the
first
time
i've
ever
done
it.
i
"said,"
"\"david,"
it's
too
cheap.
you
got
to
spend
more
than
"that.\""
so
a
friend
of
"mine,"
ron
"baron,"
he's
got
an
office
"building,"
and
he's
got
jerusalem
stone
facing
the
elevators
in
this
high-rise
"building,"
jerusalem
stone.
and
every
time
i
go
"in,"
he
"goes,"
"\"oh,"
you
got
to
see
jerusalem
"stone.\""
and
he
paid
a
fortune
for
it.
he's
so
proud
of
it.
he
doesn't
talk
about
anything
but
his
jerusalem
stone.
i
"said,"
"\"david,"
do
me
a
favor.
you're
i
jerusalem.
"right?\""
"\"yes.\""
"\"do"
they
have
jerusalem
"stone?\""
"\"they"
got
so
"much,"
we
don't
know
what
to
do
with
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"use"
all
jerusalem
stone
when
you're
rebuilding
the
"building,"
when
you
do
your
renovation.
"everything,"
wrap
it
in
jerusalem
"stone.\""
so
i
think
we
ended
up
"spending,"
to
fix
up
the
"building,"
like
"$500,000."
can
you
believe
it?
we
were
going
to
spend
1.1
"billion,"
and
by
the
"way,"
it
would
never
get
built.
it
wouldn't
be
built
in
20
years
from
now.
and
they
like
it
so
"much,"
they
gave
up
the
plan.
they
think
this
is
better.
it's
a
better
"location,"
it's
probably
a
better
building.
but
i
could
tell
you
stories
like
that
all
night
"long,"
the
aircraft
carriers
that
cost
10
times
more
than
they
should
"cost,"
and
then
they
use
the
electric
catapults.
you've
heard
that.
right?
they
don't
want
to
use
steam.
why?
because
it's
too
"simple,"
because
it
"works,"
because
it's
better.
so
they
go
to
electric
catapults
that
they're
working
on
for
years
now.
elevators
that
are
operated
my
magnets
instead
of
hydraulic.
magnets.
it
sounds
good.
trust
"me,"
it
doesn't
work.
one
little
glass
of
water.
we're
in
the
ocean.
one
little
glass
of
"water,"
"boom,"
those
magnets
are
gone.
i
could
have
told
them
that.
i
actually
asked
the
"architect,"
"\""
have
you
ever
built
a
ship
"before?\""
it's
unbelievable.
you
heard
the
story
last
night
about
air
force
one.
it
saved
a
lot
of
money.
i
said
to
"boeing,"
"\"no."
it's
got
to
have
a
three
in
front
of
"it.\""
they
were
going
to
buy
air
force
"one,"
5.7
billion.
it's
a
lot
of
"money,"
but
"look,"
it's
a
helluva
a
deal.
it's
a
helluva
a
plane.
what
can
i
tell
you.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
is
the
new
"plane?\""
it
was
signed
by
obama.
"\"5.7"
"billion,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
lot
of
"money.\""
it's
actually
two
planes.
air
force
one
is
two
planes.
i'll
give
you
a
little.
they're
going
to
"say,"
"\"that's"
classified
"information.\""
"well,"
they've
been
flying
around
with
two
planes
for
30
"years,"
so
i
assume
somebody
knows.
and
our
air
force
one
is
31
years
old.
right?
"so,"
"look,"
it's
time.
a
lot
of
the
arab
sheiks
come
in.
i
see
their
plane.
they
have
a
brand
new
one.
i
"say,"
"\"what"
do
we
"have?\""
31
"years,"
and
we're
protecting
them.
why
the
hell
don't
we
have
a
new
one?
so
they
finally
"had,"
at
31
years
old.
the
new
one
is
totally
"different,"
747.
it's
much
"longer,"
bigger
"wingspan,"
much
more
beautiful.
it's
"modern,"
it's
beautiful.
5.7
billion.
so
i
said
to
the
head
of
"boeing,"
nice
"guy,"
"dennis,"
this
was
before
they
had
their
"difficulty,"
which
is
terrible
what
happened
to
"them,"
but
i
said
to
"him,"
"\"dennis,"
i'm
not
going
to
spend
$5.7
billion
on
a
plane.
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
i
won't
do
it.
it's
too
"much.\""
i
said
last
"night,"
i
told
this
"story,"
first
"time,"
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
got
to
have
a
three
on
"it.\""
he
"said,"
"\"we"
can't
do
it.
"no.\""
he
called
me
up
the
following
"day,"
"\"we'll"
take
200
million
"off.\""
somebody
"said,"
"\"well,"
what
are
you
"losing?\""
i
"said,"
"\"nothing."
in
"fact,"
we're
gaining
a
"generator.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
build
an
extra
"generator.\""
he
"said,"
"\"we'll"
take
200
million
"off.\""
i
"said,"
"\"nope.\""
i
said
to
the
general
in
"charge,"
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
can
we
break
the
"deal?\""
"\"yes,"
"sir,"
we
can.
we
have
a
cancellation
"clause.\""
"\"good."
"general,"
execute
your
cancellation
clause.
we're
not
going
to
buy
it.
i'm
not
going
to
pay
$5.7
billion
for
air
force
one.
i'm
not
doing
"it.\""
he
"said,"
"\"yes,"
sir.
i'm
very
proud
of
this
"clause.\""
"\"why?"
"why?\""
"\"because"
we
have
the
right
to
"cancel.\""
"\"well,"
do
we
have
to
pay
"anything?\""
"\"yes,"
"sir,"
$250
"million.\""
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
don't
cancel
it.
take
it
back.
just
tell
them
we
don't
like
the
plane.
"okay?\""
and
i
couldn't
even
"say,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
buy
it
from
"europe.\""
the
only
competitor
is
europe.
i
can't
"say,"
"\"we'll"
buy
it
from
"europe.\""
"no,"
that
doesn't
work
out
to
well.
so
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
do
it.
i
don't
want
to
send
them
a
"check.\""
250
million
for
nothing.
right?
we
don't
want
to
do
it.
so
i
"said,"
"\"just"
tell
"them,"
"\"we"
don't
like
it.
the
price
is
too
high.
we're
not
going
to
buy
"it.\""
but
don't
send
"anything,"
don't
put
it
in
writing.
"please,"
"general.\""
"\"yes,"
"sir.\""
"\"thank"
"you.\""
so
about
a
week
"later,"
the
head
of
boeing
called
me
up.
he
"said,"
"\"look,"
we
can
get
it
"down,"
but
you're
asking
for
too
"much.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
don't
understand.
it
has
to
have
a
three
on
"it,"
not
a
"four,"
but
"three.\""
so
another
months
goes
by.
i
forgot
about
it.
i
get
a
call
from
"boeing,"
"\"would"
3.9
billion
be
"okay?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yes,"
that's
okay.
it's
got
a
three
on
"it.\""
true.
true
story.
true
"story,"
and
then
somebody
said
…
it's
true
"though,"
somebody
"said,"
"\"well,"
it
must
be
a
different
"plane.\""
yeah.
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
we
have
a
much
nicer
paint
"job.\""
we
have
a
much
nicer
paint
"job,"
you
know
"that,"
and
it
actually
got
an
extra
generator
put
on.
okay?
so
it's
actually
more.
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
we
could
use
an
extra
"generator.\""
i
"said,"
"\"is"
there
anything
else
you
"need?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
could
use
an
extra
"generator.\""
i
"said,"
"\"we'll"
get
it
for
"you,"
we'll
get
"it.\""
so
i
had
it
included
in
the
price.
these
people
know
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about.
it's
called
included
in
the
price.
but
think
of
"it,"
there's
hundreds
of
deals
like
that.
but
you're
one
"person,"
and
that's
why
i
got
mark
meadows
"involved,"
because
he's
from
north
carolina.
he's
from
north
"carolina,"
and
he's
cheap
as
hell.
i
need
some
cheap
people.
"oh,"
there's
"many,"
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
stories.
i
could
tell
you
so
much.
it's
crazy.
the
biden
agenda
would
collapse
our
economy
and
destroy
your
country.
it
would
destroy
your
social
security
and
protections
for
preexisting
"conditions,"
it
will.
he's
going
to
drain
your
medicare
by
giving
away
our
healthcare
to
illegal
immigrants.
and
i
will
tell
you
"this,"
you're
going
to
have
socialized
medicine.
that's
as
sure
as
you're
there.
and
obama
lied
28
times
when
he
said
you
can
keep
your
"doctor,"
you
can
keep
your
plan.
it
was
a
lie.
said
it
28
"times,"
that
we
"have,"
but
it
was
a
lie.
but
now
you're
really
losing
your
doctor.
you're
going
to
have
socialized
medicine.
eliminate
private
healthcare
insurance
for
180
million
americans
who
love
their
healthcare.
they
have
the
best
in
the
world.
his
running
mate
sponsored
the
socialist
takeover
of
healthcare.
you
saw
that.
he
wants
to
ban
private
insurance.
you're
going
to
lose
…
180
million
people
are
going
to
lose
their
healthcare
under
this
biden
"character,"
and
he
has
no
clue.
they're
going
to
take
it
away
from
him.
they're
going
to
be
running
him
ragged.
"\"sign"
this.

"this.\""
"\"okay."
what
is
"it?\""
"\"doesn't"
matter.
just
sign
"it,"
"president,"
right
"now.\""
"\"i'm"
getting
tired.
i'd
like
to
"rest,"
i'd
like
to
let
kamala
take
over
as
"president.\""
that's
no
way
to
get
into
the
"office,"
because
we're
going
to
have
a
woman
president
"someday,"
but
you
know
what?
it
can't
be
kamala.
kamala.
nobody
treated
him
"worse,"
and
he
picked
her.
i'll
tell
"you,"
i
was
…
brilliant
forecast.
he
could
never
pick
her.
she
called
him
a
racist.
right?
she
talked
about
me
too-ing
him.
he
was
going
to
be
me
too-ed.
right?
me-too-ed.
a
lot
of
bad
things.
there
was
nobody.
think
of
"it,"
even
pocahontas
treated
him
better.
she
knocked
the
hell
out
of
"bloomberg,"
but
she
left
him
sort
of
alone.
i
think
she
felt
sorry
for
him.
i
heard
she
felt
sorry
for
him.
i
don't
want
people
to
feel
sorry
for
our
president.
i
want
other
"people,"
"really,"
to
feel
sorry
for
"themselves,"
because
we
have
somebody
that
knows
what
they're
doing.
we
can't
have
it.
we
can
"joke,"
we
can
play
"games,"
we
can
have
fun.
you
can't
have
this
guy
as
your
president.
you
can't
have
him.
maybe
i'll
sign
an
executive
order.
you
cannot
have
him
as
your
president.
"no,"
but
you
know
this.
everybody
knows
this.
and
you
know
what?
people
are
going
to
vote
for
him
because
they
feel
sorry
for
him.
i
feel
sorry
for
him
too.
i
feel
sorry
for
him.
and
maybe
he'll
show
up
for
an
hour-and-a-half
at
a
debate.
who
the
hell
knows?
i
don't
know.
but
you
know.
you
see
the
condition
he's
in.
you
can't
have
him
as
your
president.
and
you
know
what?
you
can't
have
her
as
your
vice
"president,"
potentially
going
to
be
president.
and
that's
why
they're
pushing
so
"hard,"
because
they
know
he's
going
to
be
out
very
"soon,"
and
she's
going
to
take
over.
and
she
is
the
furthest
left
person
of
anybody.
she
is
"rated,"
not
by
"me,"
she
is
rated
further
left
than
even
bernie
sanders.
okay?
he's
"second,"
she's
first.
we
will
hire
more
police.

"you,"

love

we
got
the

from
all

up

we
have
the
"stuff,"
nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like

the

from

we're
going
to
increase

on

enforcement.
we
will
ban

we
will
defeat

that

about

further
reduce

and
the
cost
of

we're
doing

"on,"

than
the
fact
that
the

are
spending

don't

you
will

if

with
thousands

"loyal,"
hard-working
american
patriots.
47
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
wisconsin
and
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
this
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
feel
that
way
so
"strongly,"
so
do
you.
joe
biden
devoted
his
entire
career
to
offshoring
wisconsin
"jobs,"
outsourcing
your
"factories,"
throwing
open
your
"borders,"
dragging
us
into
endless
ridiculous
foreign
wars
and
surrendering
your
children's
future
to
china.
you
know
what
he's
been
doing?
i
just
see
he's
up
there
tonight
getting
softball
questions
from
anderson
cooper.
they
don't
ask
me
questions
like
that.
and
the
audience
isn't
quite
like
this.
do
you
see
what
his
audience
…
they've
got
cars.
they
have
car
in
a
"parking,"
it's
the
weirdest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
and
cnn
is
"going,"
"\"oh,"
this
is
so
"beautiful.\""
it's
not
beautiful.
they
have
cars
in
a
parking
lot.
what
a
"deal,"
i'll
tell
"you,"
what
a
deal.
biden's
supported
every
disasterous
global
sellout
for
half
a
"century,"
including
a
"nafta,"
china.
you
take
a
look
at
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
organization
and
tpp.
he
supported
them
"all,"
"biden,"
surrendered
your
jobs
to
china
and
you
know
that.
i
probably
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
weren't
for
"that,"
it
was
one
of
the
big
"things,"
one
of
the
big
reasons
i
decided
to
say
to
my
great
"wife,"
our
first
"lady,"
let's
go
have
some
fun.
let's
go
have
some
fun.
she's
done
a
great
job
and
very
popular.
and
the
family
is
all
over
the
"place,"
all
over
the
country.
but
unlike
"joe,"
who
lets
you
down
when
he'd
never
even
came
back
to
milwaukee
to
apologize
or
just
to
pay
"respects,"
i
came
to
wisconsin
and
i've
been
here
a
lot
"since,"
since
we
started
"this,"
a
lot.
and
you've
been
a
tremendous
beneficiary
of
what
i've
done
and
i
have
"to,"
because
you've
been
with
"me,"
you've
supported
me
and
we've
had
great
victories
"together,"
all
"victories,"
so
i
want
to
thank
you.
now
biden
wants
to
surrender
our
country
to
the
violent
left-wing
mob.
you
see
what's
happening.
if
biden
wins
very
"simple,"
china
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
mob
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
"rioters,"
"anarchists,"
"arsonists,"
and
flag
"burners,"
they
win
and
we're
not
into
flag
burners.
we
don't
like
flag
burners.
i'd
like
to
"say,"
pass
a
"law,"
one
year
in
"jail,"
you
started
burning
"flags,"
we
put
you
in
jail
for
a
year.
we
should
do
that.
they
would
have
done
"that,"
it's
a
different
"world,"
i
"guess,"
but
it's
sort
of
coming
back
to
the
way
we
have
to
have
it
because
we're
for
law
and
order.
they
"say,"
don't
use
that
"term,"
it's
too
tough.
"no,"
everybody
wants
law
and
order.
minorities
want
law
and
order.
everybody
wants
law
and
order.
they
have
to
have
it.
i'm
running
for
the
reelection
and
a
very
important
reelection
to
bring
jobs
in
factories
back
and
that's
a
continuation.
because
i
don't
know
if
you
know
"it,"
the
single
greatest
year
wisconsin
has
ever
had
was
last
year.
the
second
best
year
that
wisconsin
has
ever
had
was
the
year
before.
and
guess
what
the
third
was
the
year
before
that?
and
you're
going
to
have
your
best
year
economically
next
"year,"
it's
all
heading
in
that
direction
despite
the
pandemic
given
to
us
by
china.
we
want
to
put
the
violent
criminals
behind
bars
and
we
have
to
ensure
the
future
belongs
to
"america,"
not
to
"china,"
not
to
other
very
terrible
forces
out
"there,"
because
if
we
"win,"
very
simply
america
wins.
and
that's
what
we
"want,"
we
want
this
great
country
to
win.
over
the
last
three
and
a
half
"years,"
we've
secured
america's
borders.
fixed
the
disastrous
trade
"deals,"
they
have
been
the
worst
ever.
not
even
…
it
was
not
even
…
when
i
looked
at
"these,"
i
studied
them
and
i
used
to
talk
about
"them,"
they
had
to
be
bad.
when
i
started
"studying,"
i
"said,"
"\"who"
are
the
people
that
made
these
"deals?\"2"
grossly
incompetent
people.
brought
back
our
manufacturing
"jobs,"
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
u.s.
military
and
obliterated
the
isis
caliphate.
we
open
obliterated
it.
obama
was
not
able
to
do
"it,"
he
wasn't
able
to
come
close.
it
was
just
announced
that
in
"2019,"
before
the
virus
came
in
from
"china,"
we
grew
median
income
by
a
record
of
"$4,400"
in
just
one
"year,"
achieving
the
highest
median
income
in
u.s.
history.
that's
in
the
history
of
our
country.
in
the
first
three
"years,"
we
lifted
six
point
six
million
people
out
of
"poverty,"
the
largest
poverty
reduction
of
any
president
in
the
history
of
our
country.
that's
not
bad.
and
i
didn't
even
make
these
numbers
up.
these
are
numbers
that
…
they
sound
good
to
me.
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
a
world.
this
is
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
then
the
virus
came
"in,"
we
closed
it
"down,"
we
saved
millions
and
millions
of
lives.
we'd
be
at
two
and
a
half
"million,"
two
"million,"
three
million.
a
number
that
would
not
be
"sustainable,"
would
not
be
acceptable.
a
horrible
"number,"
there
shouldn't
have
been
one
person
that
died.
it
should
have
been
stopped
at
china.
they
stopped
it
for
their
"country,"
but
it
came
out
to
"us,"
to
"europe,"
to
the
rest
of
the
"world,"
188
countries.
we
will
deliver
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
before
the
end
of
the
year.
and
it
could
be
"very,"
very
soon.
you've
been
seeing
what's
going
…
could
be
"very,"
very
soon.
could
"be,"
it's
amazing
how
all
of
a
sudden
they
hate
the
vaccine.
when
they
thought
it
couldn't
be
"done,"
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
he's
got
to
get
a
"vaccine.\""
and
then
all
of
a
"sudden,"
they're
looking
like
it's
going
to
be
very
close.
we're
doing
great.
we're
doing
great
with
vaccines
and
"therapeutics,"
"remdesivir,"
all
sorts
of
other
things
that
are
bringing
the
rates
"down,"
like
at
numbers
that
nobody
can
believe.
but
we
have
three
vaccines
right
"now,"
they're
in
the
final
"stage,"
clinical
trials.
we
worked
it
for
the
fda
where
they
approved
it
fast.
they
went
very
"fast,"
very
"quick,"
at
levels
that
nobody
else
could
have
ever
achieved.
no
other
"administration,"
certainly
the
last
"one,"
because
the
last
one
was
grossly
incompetent.
in
"fact,"
that's
why
i'm
"here,"
because
if
it
was
"good,"
i
wouldn't
have
run.
if
they
did
their
"job,"
i
wouldn't
have
run.
i
was
very
happy
in
my
other
life.
i
was
very
"happy,"
but
i'm
very
happy
in
this
life.
more
"happy,"
because
nobody
has
produced
in
three
and
a
half
"years,"
the
first
three
and
a
half
"years,"
nobody
has
done
what
we
have
been
able
to
"do,"
nobody.
so
we'll
defeat
the
virus
and
next
year
will
be
"truly,"
i
"think,"
from
an
economic
standpoint
and
from
other
"standpoints,"
maybe
the
best
year
of
all.
hard
to
believe
we're
going
so
"fast,"
the
numbers
have
been
incredible.
we've
had
employment
"numbers,"
the
best
ever.
we've
had
retail
sales
numbers
the
best
ever.
you
see
them
"all,"
they
come
out
every
day.
and
our
stock
market
is
for
the
most
"part,"
at
a
new
high.
and
if
people
have
"401ks,"
if
you
want
to
have
your
401k
go
down
like
to
depression
"levels,"
i
think
you
should
vote
for
sleepy
"joe,"
because
he's
going
to
raise
your
interest.
he'll
be
raising
your
interest
rates.
i
watch
him
"though,"
he's
denying
all
this
up.
everything
that
he
"said,"
he's
now
denying.
he
"said,"
no
"fracking,"
right?
there
will
be
no
fracking
during
the
…
he
didn't
know
what
fracking
"was,"
but
he
said
there's
no
fracking.
the
reason
is
because
everybody
"else,"
all
of
the
radical
left
candidates
up
"there,"
they
couldn't
get
too
far
"left,"
so
joe
agreed.
then
he
gets
the
"nomination,"
now
they're
all
angry.
you
know
that
crazy
"bernie,"
all
of
the
left
"democrats,"
they
don't
want
to
vote
for
him
anymore
because
he
made
promises
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
he
forgot
that
he
said
no
fracking.
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
now
we
can
do
some
"fracking.\""
but
remember
this
in
"politics,"
it's
always
the
thing
that
they
say
"first,"
that's
what
they're
going
to
do.
no
"guns,"
no
"religion,"
no
"energy,"
no
"oil,"
remember
that.
"remember,"
he
put
beto
in
charge
of
his
gun
"policy,"
right?
"beto,"
crazy
beto.
remember
when
beto
went
"out,"
he
"said,"
"\"i"
was
born
for
"this.\""
and
that's
when
it
all
came
down.
as
soon
as
i
heard
"that,"
anybody
said
they
were
born
for
"this,"
that
doesn't
play
well.
but
he's
in
charge
of
the
second
amendment.
and
you
won't
have
a
second
amendment.
"frankly,"
you
wouldn't
have
a
second
amendment
if
i
didn't
get
"elected,"
it
would
have
been
obliterated.
it
would
have
been
torn
up.
maybe
it
would
have
been
totally
knocked
out.
but
there's
tremendous
pressure
on
your
second
amendment.
as
long
as
i'm
"here,"
you'll
always
have
a
second
amendment.
but
i
want
to
just
"say,"
they
do
"disinformation,"
they
make
up
a
phony
story
and
then
they
go
with
it.
they
make
up
a
totally
phony
story.
it's
called
disinformation.
and
one
of
the
"things,"
"oh,"
what
they
"did,"
the
worst
of
all
was
the
soldiers.
"because,"
nobody
loves
our
soldiers
like
i
do
and
they
made
up
a
phony
deal.
and
that's
why
i
say
the
gloves
are
off
because
when
they
do
"that,"
that's
worse
than
what
i'm
going
to
talk
to
you
"about,"
that's
big
10.
you
know
we
got
it
"back,"
right?
we
got
big
10.
but
the
soldier
"story,"
about
standing
over
their
"graves,"
you
know
the
one
i'm
talking
"about,"
then
they
do
a
commercial.
and
i
"said,"
the
good
news
about
that
is
the
gloves
are
off.
i
can
now
call
him
grossly
"incompetent,"
the
man
is
incompetent.
he's
been
there
for
47
"years,"
he
didn't
do
a
thing.
now
all
of
a
"sudden,"
in
years
where
he
was
never
considered
"smart,"
but
now
he's
really
not
considered
smart.
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
he's
going
to
do
what
he
never
did
in
47
years.
he's
got
to
do
this
and
that
and
everything
that
i'm
"doing,"
everything
that
we're
doing.
but
i
want
to
congratulate
the
big
10
conference
on
yesterday's
announcement
that
the
fall
season
will
start
very
soon.
"oh,"
i
hope
your
team
does
well
after
all
that.
i
hope
that
team
does
well.
but
i
especially
want
to
thank
a
football
"legend,"
he
was
great.
wisconsin's
own
barry
"alvarez,"
he
was
great.
"good,"
got
to
be
careful
when
you
do
"that,"
a
lot
of
times
you
don't
like
people
too
much.
they
"say,"
"\"oh,\""
but
he's
a
good
man.
we
worked
with
him.
we
worked
with
a
whole
"group,"
including
the
commissioner
of
the
"league,"
did
a
"very,"
very
good
"job,"
did
a
very
good
job.
but
we
called
"them,"
and
the
reason
is
that
they
took
an
ad.
in
other
"words,"
another
"one,"
disinformation.
they
took
an
ad
saying
i
was
against
football.
i'm
the
one
that
said
they
shouldn't
close.
but
i
said
"that,"
if
they
"close,"
they
close.
but
then
they
took
an
ad
saying
i'm
the
"one,"
i
didn't
want
it.
i
wanted
it
closed.
so
then
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
"no,"
i
don't.
i
want
it
open.
let
me
call
up
the
"commissioner.\""
we
called
up
the
commissioner
and
he
was
great.
he
"said,"
"\"you"
really
think
"so?\""
and
bottom
"line,"
we
worked
very
"hard,"
lots
of
calls
to
lots
of
different
"states,"
lots
of
people.
we
dealt
with
the
"players,"
the
parents
of
the
"players,"
who
are
really
the
"boss,"
that's
"okay,"
i
won't
say
that.
but
these
are
players
that
have
a
shot
at
the
nfl.
they
have
a
shot
at
pro-football.
we
want
the
nfl
to
proudly
stand
when
they
sing
our
national
anthem.
or
their
ratings
are
going
to
continue
to
go
down
like
they
did
last
"weekend,"
down
27%.
because
people
don't
want
that.
you
know
"what,"
we
have
enough
"politics,"
right?
we
have
politics
here.
we
have
politics
all
over.
in
"fact,"
sometimes
i
have
to
turn
it
off.
i
can't
do
it
anymore.
i
can't
watch
me.
it's
always
…
i
can't
watch
me.
i
can't
watch.
but
"no,"
we
have
enough
politics.
we
don't
want
to
watch
now
on
"sunday,"
"all,"
here
we
go
again
with
the
"politics,"
let
them
play
"football,"
let
them
stand
and
salute
or
put
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
be
proud
of
our
country
and
be
proud
of
our
great
american
flag.
and
then
go
home
to
the
mansion
and
have
a
good
time.
take
a
nice
sauna
and
then
if
you
"want,"
after
you
"recover,"
you
come
out
and
you
go
and
you
do
your
"thing,"
whatever
the
thing
may
be.
but
people
don't
want
to
see
it
and
the
ratings
are
down.
here
we
go
again.
i
thought
we
taught
them
that
lesson
two
years
ago.
didn't
we
think?
i
thought
we
taught
that
lesson.
but
biden
would
absolutely
eradicate
your
state's
economy.
i
know
this
state
very
well.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
i
made
the
great
deal
with
canada
and
"mexico,"
but
"canada,"
because
they
were
taking
advantage
of
you
so
badly
on
your
dairy
products.
you
had
a
287%
tariff
on
your
dairy
products
with
canada.
people
don't
realize
canada
is
one
of
the
toughest
negotiators
and
they
treated
your
state
and
this
country
very
unfairly
until
i
came
"along,"
"very,"
very
unfairly.
did
you
know
that?
287.
but
i
saw
some
farmers
and
this
was
like
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back.
they
had
something
called
specialty
milk.
does
anybody
know
what
that
is?
"right,"
you
know.
a
lot
of
people
…
it's
a
small
little
grouping
of
"milks,"
specialty
milk.
but
this
was
the
final
straw.
and
i
met
some
people
and
canada
finally
did
it
to
them
like
they
did
it
to
everybody
else.
and
they
raised
a
tariffs
"massively,"
they
made
it
impossible.
they
tried
to
take
over
that
business
"too,"
along
with
all
of
"them,"
it
was
just
massive
and
horrible
what
they
did.
and
that
really
got
me
"going,"
the
little
specialty
"milk,"
specialty
"products,"
a
small
"portion,"
but
you
know
"what,"
that
was
it.
and
we
have
a
great
deal.
the
usmca
is
a
great
deal
and
i'm
very
honored
to
have
done
it.
but
it
was
all
because
of
specialty
milk
and
the
way
you
were
taken
advantage
of
by
canada.
you
"know,"
they
have
the
"wonderful,"
"oh,"
"canada,"
we
love
to
hear
the
"song,"
right?
but
let
me
tell
"you,"
they
are
very
tough.
and
they've
taken
advantage
of
our
country
for
"many,"
many
years.
and
i
will
tell
you
"this,"
they're
not
so
happy
"now,"
but
at
least
they
got
a
"deal,"
but
you're
happy.
and
it's
about
time
you
were
happy.
you
now
have
a
great
deal
and
you're
not
going
to
have
your
companies
leaving
for
mexico
anymore
or
canada.
and
you're
not
going
to
have
them
make
your
product
in
mexico
or
"canada,"
send
it
over
here
with
no
"tariff,"
with
no
tax.
where
we
lose
"tax,"
we
lose
"jobs,"
we
lose
our
"companies,"
we
lose
everything.
and
they
make
a
lot
of
money
selling
the
product
to
"us,"
same
product.
so
we're
not
doing
that
stuff
anymore.
there's
a
tremendous
"disincentive,"
it's
"called,"
"like,"
let's
not
do
it.
and
you
haven't
seen
that
lately.
you
haven't
seen
too
many
companies
leaving
have
you?
it's
sort
of
an
amazing
thing.
it's
a
little
bit
like
what
we
did
with
the
statues.
so
on
the
"statutes,"
they
were
knocking
them
down
three
or
four
months
ago.
i
"said,"
"\"do"
we
have
any
laws?
"no,"
but
there
was
a
very
old
"law.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
was
"it?\""
you
get
10
years
in
"jail,"
10
years
in
"prison,"
they
actually
use
the
word
"prison,"
which
is
a
tough
word.
you
get
10
years
in
prison
if
you
knocked
down
a
statue
or
a
monument.
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
see
that
"law,"
i
want
to
see
that
"law.\""
"right,"
"glen,"
right?
i
want
to
see
that
law.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
so
big
tax
"cuts,"
big
regulation
cuts.
the
"democrats,"
they
want
to
…
the
"democrats,"
they
want
to
just
really
break
us
down
in
terms
of
our
competitive
ability
to
compete
with
other
nations.
do
you
notice
what's
happening
with
japan?
you
notice
what's
…
we
have
taken
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
in
from
china.
we
charge
them
a
fortune.
in
"fact,"
many
farmers
in
this
"group,"
because
you
got
to
love
trump.
i
gave
you
$28
"billion,"
right?
thank
you
very
"much,"
"china,"
right?
you
were
targeted.
12
"billion,"
sonny
"purdue,"
secretary
of
agriculture.
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
how
much
have
they
been
hit
"for,"
targeted
"for?\""
remember
when
china
said
we're
not
going
to
do
"anything,"
we're
not
buying.
they
thought
they
were
going
to
put
pressure
on
us.
sonny
"said,"
"\"sir,"
12
"billion,"
the
year
before
last
and
last
year
was
"16,"
total
of
28
"billion.\""
we
took
28
billion
out
of
the
tariffs.
china
never
paid
us
25
"cents,"
not
25
cents
with
obama
and
biden.
and
in
all
fairness
with
no
"president,"
they
paid
us
nothing.
they
pay
us
now
tens
of
billions
of
dollars.
i
took
a
small
portion
of
"it,"
i
added
it
"up,"
16
and
"12,"
"28,"
and
i
"said,"
$28
billion
is
going
to
the
farmers.
did
everybody
get
that
"money,"
right?
you
had
a
very
good
"year,"
the
farmers
have
had
a
very
good
year.
last
"week,"
china
ordered
and
you
have
to
"understand,"
i
view
china
differently
now
than
i
did
six
months
"ago,"
we
made
a
great
trade
deal
but
i
view
it
differently
because
i
don't
know
if
i
can
ever
view
it
the
same.
but
last
week
they
know
how
i
feel
and
they're
very
smart.
so

of
"saying,"
we're
not
going
to
do
"business,"
which
would
have
been
okay
with
me.

worked

out

would
have
been
very
"successful,"

last
"week,"
they
had
the
largest
order
of
corn.
did
you
know
this?

the

did
anyone
know
"this,"

you
very
much.

largest
order
of
soybeans
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
one
of
the
largest
cattle
orders
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
because
they're
very
smart.
somebody
else
would
have
"said,"
"well,"
let's
not
do
business.
and
then
it
would
have
been
easy
for
"me,"
but
they
gave
us
so
much.
i
have
every
farmer
calling
up
"saying,"
please
do
me
a
favor.
we
love
this.
we
love
this.
this
is
a
great
deal.
it's
a
great
"deal,"
but
we
feel
differently
about
"it,"
don't
we?
we
just
feel
differently
about
it.
i
don't
talk
about
it
like
i
used
"to,"
i
talked
about
"it,"
it
was
great.
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
"deal,"
but
i
don't
talk
about
it
the
same
way.
at
no

has
there
been
a
clearer

you
know
they
were
destroying
our
"suburbs,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
i
don't
"know,"
if
somebody
"said,"
you
just

okay
in
the

i
"said,"
"\"how"
can
i
do
"okay,"
i
saved
the
suburbs.
what
i've
done
is
saved
the
"suburbs.\""
and
you

i
don't
have
to

i
saved

did

with

that?.
"no,"

was
that
one
of
the
greatest

remember
all
the

at

that's
a

i'm
not

just
went
off
i
think.
you
can
tell
by
the
"lights,"
they
got
that
little
beautiful
red
light.
you
see
it?
but
i
won't
say
anything
bad
about
them
but
they
are
fakers
and
do
you
remember
when
they
…
remember
when
they
were
saying
that
the
polls
are
terrible.
actually
these
polls
are
very
good
compared
…
that
was
so
bad
it
was
like
why
did
anybody
vote.
they're
called
suppression
polls.
they
make
them
so
bad
that
you
lose
all
your
"appetite,"
you
lose
all
your
"spirit,"
they
take
your
guts
"out,"
and
you
don't
go
and
"vote,"
and
your
wife
looks
at
you
and
"says,"
"\"darling"
i
love
that
"guy,"
but
he's
not
going
to
win.
he
doesn't
have
a
chance
because
the

he's
down
"10,"
he's
down
"20,"
he's
down
50
"points,"
darling.
he
can't
possibly
win.
let's
go
have
dinner
and
then
we'll
come
home
and
watch
his

but
my

didn't
buy
that
because
my
people
went
out
to

"instead,"
we
watched
her
concession
speech.

"hillary,"
that
was
a
real
piece
of
work.
remember
when
she
was
"saying,"
"\"will"
you
accept
the
decision
of
the
voters?
will
you
accept
that
"decision?\""
i
wasn't
"perfect,"
i
said
i'll
see
how
it
works
out.
i
should
have
"said,"
"\"yes,"
i
"will,\""
but
i
couldn't
do
that
because
i
know
how
crooked
she
is.
would
you
accept
the
decision?
the
anchor
said
to
me
"like,"
"\"will"
you
"accept?\""
they're
coming
after
"me,"
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
supposed
to
be
going
after
her
a
little
bit
"too.\""
did
you
ever
see
debates
where
you
had
all
of
the
anchors
plus
the
candidates
against

here
we
"sit,"
is
that
air
force

"yes,"
that's

how
did
that
happen?
a
lot
of
the
times
i'd
say
to
the
"anchor,"
i'd
"say,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
wait
a
minute.
this
isn't
"fair.\""
i
mean
i'm
watching
what
they're
doing
with
biden
where
he's
using
"teleprompters,"
"\"move"

it

we're

what
happened
to

it
seems
to
be

did
you
see
the
middle

two
days
ago?
remember
our
incompetent
negotiator
john

he
never
got
up
to

the

i

up
and
leave

you're
giving

they'd

"\"we"

he'd

"\"well,"
i'd
rather
"not.\""
"\"we"

"this.\""
"\"okay,"
you
got
"it.\""
"\"we"
want

"\"you"
got

"\"we"

say
no
and
walk.
they'll
probably
possibly
call
you
back
and
if
they
don't
that's
okay
too.
but
right
now
i
will
tell
you
"iran,"
if
we
"win,"
iran
will
be
calling
us
within
the
first
"week,"
they're
dying
to
make
a
deal.
gdp
down
27%.
they
don't
have
too
much
money
for
terror
"anymore,"
it's
actually
"amazing,"
do
you
notice
what's
going
on?
now
i
don't
want
to
speak
too
"loud,"
but
i
did
put
out
on
social
media
the
other
day
that
if
they
hit
us
in
any
"way,"
any
"form,"
written
instructions
already
"done,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
1000
times
harder
than
we've
ever
hit
them
before.
so
hopefully
they
will
just
come
and
we'll
make
a
deal
and
they'll
go
back
to
being
a
rich
"country,"
let
them
go
back
and
be
rich
but
they
cannot
have
a
nuclear
weapon.
they
cannot.
that
deal
was
so
bad
that
obama
made.
$150
"billion,"
they
got
$150
billion
for
nothing.
you
know
the
deal
is
practically
…
if
i
didn't
terminate
it
which
i'm
proud
to
have
"done,"
but
if
i
didn't
terminate
"it,"
they
got
$1.8
billion
in
"cash,"
how
about
that?
if
i
didn't
terminate
that
stupid
"deal,"
first
of
all
you
wouldn't
have
the
deal
in
the
middle
east
and
all
these
countries
are
"joining,"
it's
happening
fast.
they
want
to
all
join.
we
did
"it,"
you
"know,"
the
reverse.
we
did
it
the
…
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
very
much.
you
know
it's
"interesting,"
thank
you
very
much.
i
knew
i
like
you.
so
the
nobel
peace
prize.
so
the
funny
"thing,"
a
lot
of
people
don't
know
because
the
fake
news
doesn't
write
about
it.
so
if
you're
a
"president,"
right?
and
you
are
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
"prize,"
you're
the
united
"states,"
"no,"
but
think
of
this.
that's
a
big
deal.
i
mean
obama
got
it
like
in
his
first
couple
of
weeks
and
nobody
knew
why
he
got
it
including
"him,"
remember?
he
couldn't
tell
you
why.
he
had
no
idea.
to
this
"day,"
he
has
no
idea
why
he
got
it.
but
if
you're
a
president
and
you
get
"nominated,"
then
two
days
"later,"
you
get
"nominated,"
did
you
know
"this,"
a
second
"time,"
for
a
different
deal.
kosovo.
serbia.
they've
been
killing
each
other
for
hundreds
of
years.
i
stopped
a
lot
of
death
and
i
did
it
like
"easy,"
it
wasn't
hard
for
me.
it's
sort
of
a
natural
thing
to
do
but
we
did
a
good
thing.
but
you
know
what?
they
did
a
check.
so
i
got
nominated
twice
for
the
nobel
peace
"prize,"
that's
a
big
"deal,"
i
don't
know.
i
should
have
gotten
nominated
seven
times
because
we
did
a
lot
of
other
"things,"
but
these
are
for
two
different
"deals,"
and
not
one
mention
was
made
on
the
evening
news.
think
of
it.
i
got
rid
of
the
"prosecutor,"
here's
the
"billion,"
right?
but
they
don't
want
to
play
that
too
often.
you
have
to
look
around
for
it.
it's
a
very
unfair
deal
but
as
the
expression
"goes,"
we
"won,"
i
don't
know
how
the
hell
we
did
it.
when
you
look
at
the
"opposition,"
when
you
look
at
how
unfair
it
is
and
these
guys
know
very
"well,"
you
look
at
how
unfair
it
"is,"
it's
pretty
damn
"good,"
but
we
have
a
lot
of
support.
we
have
tremendous
support
of
the
people.
these
"rallies,"
look
at
this
rally.
these
rallies
…
these
rallies
are
incredible
gap
ever
polled.
i'm
not
a
believer
in
the
polls
but
i
believe
that
one.
it's
the
biggest
enthusiasm
"gap,"
he's
got
no
enthusiasm.
the
only
enthusiasm
is
for
the
people
that
want
to
beat
"us,"
they
want
to
beat
me.
that's
the
only
thing
he's
"got,"
the
people
that
want
to
…
they
couldn't
care
less
about
him.
he
could
be
that
piece
of
wood
that
was
left
in
the
ground.
biden
will

the
keys
to

earlier
today
i
took
a
historic
stand
against
the
hateful
lies
being
fed
to
america's
"youth,"
the
parents
know
all
about
it.
i
"checked,"
they're
doing
it
in
wisconsin
too.
i
was
a
little
"surprised,"
i'm
a
little
surprised.
i'm
a
little
surprised
you
let
it
happen
actually
but
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
it.
i
announced
that
we're
launching
a
new
pro-american
lesson
plan
for
students
called
1776
commission.
we're
going
to
teach
our
children
the
truth
about
"america,"
that
we're
the
most
exceptional
nation
ever
to
exist
and
we're
getting
better
every
single
day.

owned
and
controlled
by
the

left.
he
even
opposed
sending
the
national
guard
into
a
place
called
"kenosha,"
did
you
ever
hear
of
kenosha?
how
about
"that,"
did
we
do
a
good
job?
i
wish
we
did
it
a
little
sooner
but
we
finally
got
your
governor's
okay.
we
have
to
do
that
if
…
we
got
to
get
the
governors
to
say
please
do
it.
how
they
don't
do
"it,"
how
they
don't
do
it
in
some
other
places
when
you
look
at
what's
going
on
with
"chicago,"
right?
when
you
look
at
what's
going
on
with
"portland,"
those
are
just
anarchists.
you
know
how
long
it
would
take
us
to
fix
up
portland
in
terms
of
ending
it
all?
i'd
say
far
less
than
an
"hour,"
i'd
say
a
half
hour.
look
what
we
did
at
minneapolis.
we're
doing
well
in
minnesota
because
they
saw
what
happened.
now
they
shouldn't
have
allowed
it
to
go
on
for
11
"days,"
they
should
have
called
us
immediately
but
do
you
remember
that
beautiful
night?
nice
"evening,"
a
little
"problem,"
there
were
a
lot
of
buildings
in
the
background
that
were
burning
down
to
the
ground
as
reporters
"said,"
"\"no,"
this
is
a
peaceful
"protest.\""
i
don't
know
if
it's
your
state
but
a
couple
of
them
they
have
…
you're
allowed
to
"protest,"
so
you
can't
go
to
church
but
you
can
rip
the
hell
out
of
the
"streets,"
of
main
"street,"
of
5th
"avenue,"
break
up
the
stores.
burn
down
the
buildings.
climb
over
each
other's
"face,"
you
can
climb
right
over
their
face.
you
don't
have
to
wear
"masks,"
you
don't
have
to
do
anything.
"25,000"
people
walking
down
the
"street,"
"looters,"
"anarchists,"
"agitators,"
burning
down

throwing
things
at

they've
taken
the
authority
away
from
our
"police,"
our
great
police.
they've
taken
their
authority
and
their
dignity
away.
we're
giving
it
"back,"
we
have
"to,"
we
have
to.
by
the
"way,"
i
was
endorsed
by
new
york's
finest
and
we're
with
them
all
the
way.
i
was
just
endorsed
two
days
ago
by
chicago
police.
i
think
that
takes
"courage,"
right?
"philadelphia,"
"florida,"
"texas,"
"everybody,"
ohio.
i
don't
"know,"
did
anybody
…
is
there
one
group
of
…
even
if
it
was
a
tiny
little
group
of
two
or
three
"police,"
did
anybody
endorse
sleepy
joe?
i
don't
think
so.
but
we
did
a
great
job
in
kenosha.
we
got
out
"there,"
i
went
there
as
you
"know,"
a
little
while
ago
but
had
we
not
gone
in
that
place
would
…
it
would
have
been
burned
to
the
ground.
they
did
"damage,"
we
should
have
gone
in.
i
wanted
to
go
in
the
first
"night,"
we
would
have
stopped
it
immediately
but
it
was
a
great
outcome
as
was
in
minnesota.
"again,"
if
they
would
have
called
us
early
it
would
have
been
over.
"portland,"
i'd
love
to
go
there.
that
would
be
so
easy.
you
know
in
"seattle,"
they
heard
we
were
coming
"in,"
they
gave
up.
they
heard
we
…
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
enough.
we're
going
in.
i
don't
care.
we're
going
"in.\""
"\"do"
you
have
"permission.\""
"\"no,"
we're
going
"in.\""
they
took
over
a
chunk
of
the
"city,"
and
when
they
heard
we
were
going
in
it's
"like,"
"\"well"
we
give
"up,"
that's
"it.\""
that
was
the
end
of
the
settle
problem.
it's
a
terrible
thing
that's
going
on.
all
in
democratic
"run,"
super
liberal
"run,"
cities.
the
red
cities
are
doing
great.
i
think
we're
doing
great
all
"over,"
the
republican
"cities,"
we're
fair.
we're
not
stupid.
how
stupid
these
people
are.
did
you
see
chicago?
48
people
"shot,"
six
died.
you
know
we're
in
"afghanistan,"
we're
pulling
the
"troops,"
you
know
"that,"
we're
coming
"back,"
we're
almost
finished.
we're
pulling
…
"finally,"
these
endless
wars.
these
endless
"wars,"
and
we
had
to
fight
other
things
but
we've
done
a
great
job
but
we're
acting
like
a
police
force
over
there.
"no,"
we're
pulling
the
"troops,"
we're
almost
out
of
iraq.
that's
another
"one,"
we're
down
to
about
"2,000"
"troops,"
did
you
know
that
sean?
"2,000"
troops.
so
"syria,"
we're
out
but
we
kept
the
oil
so
we
have
some
…
was
it
okay
that
we
at
least
kept
the
oil?
i
feel
badly
because
we
have
some
troops
…
"\"well"
you
haven't
pulled
the
"troops.\""
no
"no,"
we're
"gone,"
we
pulled
all
the
troops
out
of
syria.
remember
we
were
supposed
to
be
guarding
the
border
between
syria
and
turkey?
i
"said,"
"\"why"
are
we
doing
"that?\""
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
we
"are.\""
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
we
have
an
army
of
"100,000"
"here,"
an
army
of
"25,000,"
"30,000"
here.
we
got
"5,000"
soldiers.
that's
a
very
dangerous
position
to
be
"in.\""
i
don't
like
it.
they've
been
guarding
their
own
borders
with
different
names
for
a
thousand
years.
why
the
hell
do
we
have
to
be
over
there
guarding
their
border?
we
want
to
guard
our
own
"borders,"
"right,"
where
we're
doing
very
well.
where
we're
doing
very
well.
we're
doing
great
on
our
southern
"border,"
i
hate
to
say
"this,"
but
that
wall
is
going
up
very
"rapidly,"
10
miles
a
week.
we're
up
to
330
miles
and
the
wall
will
be
finished
very
soon.
you
think
that
was
"easy,"
that
was
not
"easy,"
our
great
congressman
over
"here,"
that
was
not
easy.
the
democrats
were
totally
in
favor
of
the
wall
until
i
said
when
i
came
"in,"
"\"we"
will
build
the
"wall.\""
as
soon
as
i
said
"it,"
they
were
against
the
wall.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
don't
want
you
to
build
the
wall.
walls
don't
"work.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no"
"no,"
walls
always
"work.\""
you
know
what
else
works?
the
wheel.
the
wheel
and
the
"wall,"
you
can
go
back.
come
back
in
"1,000"
years
from
now.
the
only
two
things
i
know
for
"sure,"
you're
going
to
have
a
wheel
and
you're
going
to
have
a
wall.
the
"computers,"
they
come
up
with
a
brand
new
"computer,"
it's
"genius,"
12
days
"later,"
it's
obsolete.
but
walls
are
never
"obsolete,"
neither
are
wheels.
so
i
made
one
mistake
and
i
tell
this
to
these
guys
because
they
were
great
warriors
for
"me,"
the
congressmen.
they
were
incredible
actually.
i
tell
it
to
them.
i
should
have
said
instead
of
we
will
build
the
"wall,"
we
will
build
the
"wall,"
we
will
build
…
then
the
democrats
held
us
up
and
fought
us
and
sued
us
and
everything
else
and
now
we
won
so
many
lawsuits
on
the
wall
and
we
had
the
military
"money,"
i
can
build
like
10
walls
with
all
the
money
we
have.
it's
the
craziest
thing.
maybe
we'll
build
it
double
thick
or
we'll
go
twice
as
high.
"no,"
but
the
wall
is
great.
"everything,"
"everything,"
that
they
"wanted,"
but
i
made
one
mistake.
i
should
have
"said,"
"\"we"
will
not
build
a
"wall.\""
then
they
would
have
insisted
that
we
build
"it,"
i
could
have
saved
two
years
of
litigation.
"\"we"
will
not
build
a
wall
under
any
"circumstances.\""
then
pelosi
would
"say,"
"\"we"
demand
that
you
build
a
"wall.\""
these
people
are
terrible.
crazy
"nancy,"
crazy
as
a
bedbug.
she's
crazy
as
a
bedbug.
she
decided
to
make
a
nice
little
stop-in
at
the
beauty
"parlor,"
how
did
that
work
out?
not
too
"good,"
it
didn't
work
out
too
well.
can
you
imagine?
the
owner
of
the
beauty
parlor
is
a
maga
"lady,"
she
loves
trump.
can
you
believe
it?
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
i
think
if
i
owned
a
beauty
"parlor,"
i
had
a
"customer,"
i'm
not
sure
i'd
be
turning
her
in.
the
owner
turned
nancy
in.
that's
a
lot
of
hate.
that's
serious
"hate,"
right?
"no,"
she's
a
great
owner.
as
far
as
i'm
"concerned,"
i
think
she's
fantastic.
she's
for
us.
they
"said,"
"\"what"
made
you
do
"it?\""
you
know
what
she
"said,"
"\"because"
i
see
how
hard
our
president
has
to
work.
i
see
what
they
put
him
through.
i
see
what
he
puts
with
and
i
turned
her
"in.\""
how
about
that?
how
about
that?
we
love
her.
she
can
do
my
hair
anytime.
i
think
i'm
going
to
call
her
in.
check
it
"out,"
maybe
you
can
do
something.
maybe
you
can
improve
"it,"
it's
not
bad
though.
i
have
friends
that
…
i
have
friends
my
"age,"
they're
not
looking
too
good.
instead
of
standing
up
for
"america,"
joe
biden
and
the
"democrats,"
they
condemn
america
and
war
is
always
waged
on
our
great
law
enforcement.
we
love
our
law
enforcement.
kamala
"harris,"
that's
another
great
"beauty,"
kamala
"harris,"
that's
a
beauty.
"remember,"
i
tell
this
story
all
the
time.
when
you
pick
"somebody,"
you
pick
somebody
that's
"hot,"
that's
going
in
the
right
"direction,"
right?
she
came
"out,"
she
was
at
like
"14,"
15
in
the
"polls,"
and
she
started
going
"down,"
"down,"
"down,"
it
never
stopped.
it
drove
her
crazy.
she
was
terrible
at
the
debates.
wait
till
you
see
what
…
i
don't
want
to
put
pressure
on
him
but
wait
till
you
see
what
mike
pence
does
to
her
in
the
"debates,"
but
i
don't
want
to
put
…
i
don't
want
to
put
pressure
on
mike.
do
we
have
a
great
vice
president?
is
he
good?
he's
"great,"
and
he
loves
this
state.
loves
all
the
states
actually.
he's
just
a
great
american
but
do
you
remember
his
last
debate?
what
he
did
to
that
character
from
virginia?
that
one
wasn't
good.
the
other
guy's
jumping
"around,"
mike
is
just
sitting
"there,"
we
love
"america,"
we're
going
to
lower
your
taxes.
thank
"you,"
you
win.
"no,"
mike
is
great.
but
kamala
harris
and
13
members
of
biden's
staff
urged
their
supporters
to
donate
to
a
fund
to
bail
out
"rioters,"
take
them
out
of
"jail,"
get
them
out
of
jail
as
soon
as
possible.
including
one
who
attempted
to
murder
a
police
"officer,"
a
man
who
was
accused
of
sexually
assaulting
an
eight-year-old
girl.
this
is
what
we're
dealing
with.
this
is
what
we're
dealing
with.
you
know
kamala
was
"considered,"
is
considered
further
left
than
crazy
"bernie,"
think
of
that.
they
got
there
…
i
mean
"seriously,"
watch.
you
know
the
manifesto
that
biden
and
…
it's
not
"biden,"
biden
has
not
agreed
to
anything.
his
"people,"
his
"representatives,"
because
biden
doesn't
know
he's
"alive,"
let's
not
kid
ourselves.
biden.
biden
didn't
"agree,"
he
"didn't,"
they
just
told
him
what's
happening.
they
"said,"
"\"listen,"
you're
against
fracking
but
now
you
have
to
be
in
favor
of
fracking
because
you
lucked
out.
elizabeth
warren
decided
not
to
drop
out
and
when
she
"stayed,\""
"pocahontas,"
you
know
pocahontas?
did
anybody
ever
hear
of
her?
she's
another
great
one.
pocahontas.
i
said
to
her
a
long
time
"ago,"
i've
got
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
you
do
and
i
have
"none,"
i
have
none.
sadly.
i'd
love
a
little
bit
of
"it,"
but
i
have
"none,"
i
said
…
i
turned
out
to
be
right.
she
choked
and
she
went
for
a
blood
test.
remember?
was
it
1024th?
meaning
maybe
nine
hundred
years
"ago,"
there
was
a
little
action
going
on.
crazy
"pocahontas,"
she's
a
nasty
one
"though,"
isn't
she?
she's
a
terrible
person.
i
was
hoping
that
she'd
win
so
we
could
go
after
her
because
i
think
kamala
is
not
as
smart
but
she's
a
little
bit
less
vicious.
i
think
this.
the
one
who
treated
sleepy
joe
the
worst
was
kamala.
she
accused
him
of
"metoo,"
she
accused
him
of
everything.
she
accused
him
of
…
that
he
was
a
"racist,"
right?
that
he
was
a
racist?
because
what
he's
done
to
the
black
population
of
this
country
was
a
terrible
thing.
she's
accused
him
of
everything
under
the
"book,"
the
"busing,"
"remember,"
the
busing
scandal.
so
i
said
brilliantly
he'll
never
pick
her
because
she
was
too
terrible
to
him.
she
was
the
worst
of
everybody.
by
"far,"
i
would
"say,"
but
she
picked
him
and
hopefully
that's
going
to
be
"history,"
it's
not
going
to
"matter,"
and
that
is
no
way
for
a
woman
to
become
the
first
"president,"
that's
for
sure.
if
a
woman
is
going
to
become
the
first
president
of
the
united
"states,"
it
can't
be
her.
that
would
rip
our
country
apart.
this
is
not
what
people
want
and
she
comes
in
through
the
"backdoor,"
this
would
not
be
what
people
"want,"
especially
because
it's
her.
biden
has
called
to
end
cash
"bail,"
you
know
that
"right,"
for
vicious
criminals?
meaning
if
you
assault
a
copy
or
anybody
"else,"
you're
right
back
on
the
street
the
next
day.
he
called
for
police
and
he
calls
them
all
the
time
the
enemy.
he
says
they're
the
enemy
and
he
just
thinks
it's
terrible.
he
think
it's
terrible.
now
he's
liking
the
police
much
more.
it's
a
little
late.
"remember,"
first
"instinct,"
that's
where
they're
"going,"
and
he
has
no
choice
because
he
has
"to,"
because
"again,"
i
was
going
to
"say,"
the
radical
left
hates
him
because
they
think
he
deceived
them
because
they
agreed
on
that
manifesto
and
that
manifesto
is
seriously
a
leftist
dream
and
he
agreed
from
the
green
new
"deal,"
getting
rid
of
your
planes.
no
more
airplane
trips.
remember
the
crazy
senator
from
hawaii?
"\"do"
you
like
the
green
new
"deal?\""
"\"i"
love
it
very
"much,\""
he
said.
oh
"okay,"
well
you're
the
senator
from
"hawaii,"
that's
"right,"
the
beautiful
island
of
hawaii.
she
"said,"
"\"under"
the
green
new
deal
you
basically
can't
fly
in
an
"airplane.\""
"\"oh"
that's
a
"problem.\""
so
they
said
they'd
build
a
bridge
from
the
mainland
to
hawaii.
it's
"2,000"
miles
long
but
these
are
minor
details.
remember
her
when
they
explained
to
her
that
planes
are
"out,"
cows
are
out.
"cows,"
they
don't
want
"cattle,"
they
don't
want
cows.
did
they
withdraw
that
one?
that
was
a
tough
"one,"
wasn't
it?
they
don't
want
"cows,"
bad
for
the
ozone
layer.
who
would
even
think
of
that?
you'd
got
to
be
sick
to
even
think
"it,"
okay?
give
me
a
break.
give
me
a
break
and
i
guess
under
that
theory
this
big
guy
is
"next,"
he's
next.
"no,"
it's
a
sick
deal
going
on
there.
to
do
it
the
way
they
want
would
cost
$100
trillion.
that's
more
money
than
this
country
could
earn
in
"1,000"
years
to
do
it
right.
"\""
we
don't
like
that
"building,"
the
windows
are
too
"large.\""
"\"okay,"
let's
rip
it
down
and
build
a
new
"one.\""
what
windows
are
you
going
to
have?
you're
not
going
to
have
windows
anymore.
environmental.
they
love
wind
"too,"
right?
the
big
"windmills,"
i
always
"say,"
the
greatest
graveyard
in
the
world
for
"birds,"
just
walk
under
a
windmill.
you
will
see
more
dead
birds
than
you
will
ever
"imagine,"
what's
"happening,"
including
eagles.
you
"know,"
in
california
they
put
you
in
jail
if
you
shoot
a
bald
"eagle,"
right?
you
go
to
"jail,"
right?
these
windmills
are
knocking
them
out
of
the
sky
all
day
long.
it's
"unbelievable,"
and
yet
they
want
"wind,"
and
wind
also
is
"very,"
it's
very
hard
to
store
the
electricity
from
wind.
so
if
you
go
home
and
you
want
to
watch
television
because
president
trump
is
on
and
you
want
to
watch
one
of
his
very
brilliant
state
of
the
union
"addresses,"
if
the
wind
isn't
"blowing,"
the
husband
looks
at
the
"wife,"
"says,"
"\"darling,"
i'm
"sorry,"
you
can't
watch
tonight.
the
wind
is
not
"blowing.\""
"\"sorry,"
you
can't
watch
tonight.
the
wind
is
not
"blowing.\""
and
she
looks
at
"me,"
"\"i"
like
the
old
days.
it's
much
"better.\""
but
the
rhetoric
of
biden
and
the
radical
left
puts
your
law
enforcement
in
serious
danger.
last
"weekend,"
two
los
angeles
sheriff's
deputies
were
ambushed
and
shot
at
point
blank
range.
and
we
have
everybody
looking
for
that
creep
that
did
it.
i
called
him
an
animal
the
other
night.
i
"said,"
"\"he's"
an
"animal,\""
and
we
were
challenged
by
some
people
on
the
left.
"\"he's"
not
an
animal.
he's
a
human
"being.\""
he's
not
a
human
being.
they
got
to
find
him.
they
got
to
find
him.
and
the
penalty
has
to
be
very
"fast,"
very
swift
and
"very,"
very
severe.
you
can't
do
that.
we
call
for
the
death
penalty
if
you
kill
a
policeman.
you
know
"that,"
right?
but
the
anti
police
"demonstrators,"
they
cheered
and
cheered
when
they
saw
this.
and
then
they
tried
to
stop
them
from
even
getting
into
the
hospital.
as
"president,"
i'll
always
support
the
heroes
of
law
enforcement
and
i'll
fight
to
ensure
that
criminals
who
murder
police
officers
do
indeed
get
the
death
penalty.
they
want
prisoners
to
vote
"too,"
they
wanted
to.
i
"said,"
"\"so"
what
about
the
boston
"bomber?\""
remember
bernie
sanders?
he
wanted
all
prisoners
to
have.
and
i
"said,"
"\"does"
that
mean
"everybody?\""
"\"yes.\""
so
we
sent
in
a
"question,"
"\"does"
that
include
the
boston
bomber?
is
he
entitled
to
a
"vote?\""
and
even
bernie
is
"going,"
"\"oh"
"man,"
let's
get
into
a
different
question.
this
is
not
a
good
"question.\""
but
we
want
to
get
"that,"
we
want
to
take
care
of
it.
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
problems
that
we
"have,"
you
look
at
"crime,"
even
somebody
brought
it
up
"today,"
we're
doing
a
great
job
relative
to
other
countries
on
the
coronavirus.
you
know
how
many
names
we
have?
like
22
different
names.
i
call
it
the
china
virus.
we're
doing
a
great
job.
but
if
you
want
to
really
see
a
great
"job,"
take
new
york
and
some
of
these
other
democrat
run
states
out
of
it.
you'll
see
numbers
that
are
unbelievable
because
new
york
had
a
"very,"
very
hard
time.
a
lot
of
bad
things
happened.
but
you
take
a
few
of
the
states
out
and
you'll
really
see
numbers.
but
by
comparison
to
other
countries
and
by
almost
all
"metrics,"
we've
done
an
incredible
"job,"
including
the
job
of
helping
the
world
with
ventilators
and
all
of
the
things
that
we
built.
and
i
think
our
task
force
has
been
incredible.
and
mike
pence
has
done
a
great
job.
biden
opposes
the
death
penalty
for
cop
killers
or
mass
murderers.
biden
says
he
wants
to
protect
black
"lives,"
but
his
radical
platform
will
cut
short
the
lives
of
thousands
of
african
american
citizens.
the
democrat
party's
war
on
cops
has
already
led
to
surging
homicides
in
democrat
controlled
cities.
yet
biden
supports
imposing
these
failed
policies
nationwide.
they
ask
"him,"
"\"what"
about
nationwide?
what
about
the
fact
that
you
just
had
your
democrat
national
"convention?\""
"where,"
by
the
"way,"
we
had
far
many
more
"viewers,"
millions
and
millions
of
more
viewers.
we
had
millions
of
more.
i
thought
it
was
a
great
thing.
did
anybody
hear
herschel
walker
that
night?
it
was
…
well.
you
talk
about
a
good
football
player.
he
was
some
player.
what
a
great
guy.
but
all
of
"them,"
everybody.
the
first
lady
did
"great,"
ivanka
did
great.
they
all
"did,"
they
did
great.
we
had
some
…
and
some
incredible
"stories,"
some
very
sad
stories
when
you
look
and
see
what
happened.
but
biden's
plan
is
to
appease
the
domestic
terrorists.
my
plan
is
to
arrest
the
domestic
terrorists.
joe
biden
is
a
weak
person.
he's
always
been
a
weak
person.
and
that
was
in
prime
time.
and
prime
time
was
25
years
ago.
and
let
me
tell
"you,"
he's
not
old.
i
always
defend
him
on
this.
i
have
friends
that
are
"85,"
"89,"
"92,"
"95,"
and
they're
100%.
there's
just
something
wrong
with
joe.
he's
"off,"
okay?
he's
"off,"
and
i
have
no
problem
saying
it
anymore
when
i
watch
the
"disinformation,"
because
this
is
not
disinformation.
this
is
fact.
if
he's
"elected,"
his
radical
supporters
won't
just
be
causing
mayhem
on
the
"streets,"
they'll
be
running
the
department
of
"justice,"
department
of
homeland
"security,"
the
department
of
education.
and
most
"importantly,"
they
will
put
many
judges
on
the
united
states
supreme
court.
we
can't
have
that.
we'll
have
a
totally
different
country;
radical
left
judges.
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
second
amendment.
it
has
to
do
with
right
to
"life,"
it
has
to
do
with
so
many
different
things
that
will
turn
your
world
upside
down.
and
they'll
have
"one,"
"two,"
three
or
"four,"
whoever
is
the
next
president.
and
"hopefully,"
that's
going
to
be
us.
not
"me,"
us.
it's
us.
but
i
put
"it,"
and
think
of
"this,"
by
the
end
of
the
"term,"
we'll
have
approximately
300
brand
"new,"
great
federal
"judges,"
court
of
appeals
judges
"300,"
which
is
a
"record,"
300.
give
or
take
a
"little,"
tiny
"bit,"
but
300.
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
i
want
to
thank
president
obama.
he
left
us
142
openings.
nobody
gets
left
one
opening.
a
federal
judgeship
is
a
big
deal.
nobody
gets
left
any
openings.
he
gave
us
142
openings.
thank
you
very
much.
what
happened?
they
thought
hillary
was
going
to
"win,"
so
they
didn't
push
it.
and
then
they
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
these
polls
are
getting
a
little
close
at
the
"end.\""
and
they
tried
like
hell
to
get
some
judges
"approved,"
but
it
didn't
work.
that's
what
happens.
you
got
to
go
and
you
have
to
act
fast.
you
got
to
get
it
done.
get
it
"done,"
right?
we
get
things
done
like
nobody's
ever
gotten
it.
"oh,"
he
was
a
great
president.
he
was
great.
he
left
142
judges
for
the
republicans.
he
was
a
great
"president,"
right?
if
you
are
of
that
side
of
the
plate
of
that
"ideology,"
and
you
had
a
president
that
left
you
142
federal
"judgeships,"
i
don't
think
you'd
rate
him
as
doing
a
good
job.
"hey,"
look
at
what
happened
in
"iraq,"
look
at
what
happened
with
"isis,"
look
at
what
happened
with
our
"military,"
look
at
what
happened
with
our
vets.
our
vets
are
better
taken
care
of
now
than
they've
ever
been
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
but
never
forget
they
are
coming
after
me
because
i
am
fighting
for
you.
and
that's
true.
that's
true.
and
we're
winning
the
fight
and
we're
winning
this
election.
this
"election,"
we
are
doing
well.
they
refuse
to
say
it.
they
refuse
to
say
"it,"
and
they
hate
to
say
it.
it
just
drives
them
crazy.
but
that
"night,"
remember
they
started
off
by
"saying,"
"\"this"
will
be
a
very
short
evening
for
donald
"trump.\""
that
was
donald
trump
in
those
days.
"now,"
it's
president
trump.
i
lost
all
my
friends
because
of
this
position.
i
had
friends.
"\"hey,"
"don,"
let's
go
to
"dinner.\""
"\"okay."
"good,"
richard.
i'll
"go.\""
"hey,"
"don,"
let's
"go.\""
"\"okay,"
larry.
i'll
see
you
later.
i'll
meet
you
at
a
restaurant
in
new
"york.\""
everybody
was
nice
and
loose.
you
could
have
a
great
"conversation,"
and
you
don't
want
to
know
what
we
talked
about.
it's
just
none
of
your
"business,"
but
we
were
loose.
all
of
a
"sudden,"
i'd
become
president
of
the
united
states.
and
these
are
a
lot
of
…
i
know
a
lot
of
important
people.
"actually,"
the
people
i
like
the
best
are
the
people
that
are
less
successful
because
it
makes
you
feel
so
powerful.
i
always
"say,"
never
go
out
with
a
successful
person.
you'll
understand.
but
i
know
a
lot
of
very
successful
"people,"
"very,"
very
successful.
and
now
they
call
me
"up,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
"sir,"
would
you
like
to
get
together
"sometime?\""
i
"say,"
"\"loosen"
up.
"yes,"
call
me
donald.
you've
known
me
for
30
"years,"
call
me
"donald.\""
"\"oh,"
thank
you
so
much.
thank
"you,"
mr.
"president,"
i
appreciate
"it.\""
i
lost
all
my
friends
because
it's
respect
for
the
"office,"
let's
face
it.
it's
different.
they
used
to
be
"loose,"
they
used
to
be
great.
you
could
sit
"back,"
i'm
not
a
"drinker,"
but
you
could
sit
back
and
have
a
"drink,"
whatever
the
hell
you're
drinking.
and
"now,"
you
can't
do
that
anymore.
you
can't
do
it
anymore.
so
i
have
to
rely
on
people
in
congress
to
be
my
friends.
and
we
just
happened
to
have
a
couple
tonight.
and
one
of
them
who's
been
a
great
warrior
and
he's
doing
a
fantastic
"job,"
i
just
saw
you
on
television
by
the
"way,"
bryan.
does
everybody
know
bryan
steil?
bryan
steil;
"young,"
"handsome,"
but
a
warrior.
when
the
fake
impeachment
"happened,"
it
was
a
total
"fake,"
what
did
we
finish
up
with
the
republicans?
197
to
"nothing,"
right
at
the
house.
one
"night,"
it
was
a
fake
impeachment.
i
got
impeached
over
a
perfect
phone
call
of
congratulations
to
the
president
of
"ukraine,"
who
i
never
met
before.
if
you're
going
to
do
"something,"
at
least
know
him
a
little
"bit,"
right?
i
never
met
him.
and
then
they
said
it
was
eight
"times,"
quid
pro
quo.
that
was
adam
schiff.
shifty
"schiff,"
right?
and
he
went
before
congress
and
he
repeated
my
"conversation,"
except
that
he
made
it
all
up.
remember
he
repeated
it?
and
then
i
"said,"
"\"ah,"
"fortunately,"
we
had
that
whole
thing
essentially
"recorded.\""
i'm
glad
i
"did,"
but
these
are
very
"deceptive,"
"deceiving,"
sick
people.
and
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
he
lied
because
there
was
no
quid
pro
"quo.\""
it
was
a
perfect
conversation.
but
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
because
they
had
already
embarrassed
themselves
by
doing
it.
and
nancy
pelosi
was
all
set.
she
loved
doing
"it,"
she
from
day
"one,"
but
she
thought
it
was
what
schiff
said.
when
she
saw
the
"conversation,"
she
said
to
her
"people,"
"\"what"
the
hell
did
you
get
me
"into?\""
so
they
could
have
dropped
"it,"
but
they
"said,"
"\"let's"
give
it
a
"shot.\""
he's
another
"beauty,"
mitt
romney.
he's
a
real
beauty.
he
couldn't
get
elected
dog
catcher
right
now
in
utah.
so
we
have
another
great
one
and
he's
really
a
friend
of
"mine,"
and
he's
been
solid.
he
loves
his
country
and
he
loves
his
"state,"
glenn
grothman.
"glenn,"
thank
you
very
"much,"
friend.
and
a
man
who
just
got
"elected,"
and
he's
from
an
area
that
i
know
very
"well,"
we
did
very
"well,"
we
got
our
"big,"
"big,"
"fat,"
beautiful
contract
that
produced
lots
of
jobs.
but
he
was
taking
a
legend's
"place,"
so
it's
never
easy
to
replace
a
legend.
that's
"duffy,"
in
case
anybody
…
and
they
was
running
and
we
did
a
lot
of
work
for
"him,"
and
it
was
great.
and
he
reacted
very
well
under
pressure.
a
lot
of
people
don't
react
well
under
pressure.
they
"choke,"
they
choke.
he
was
under
a
lot
of
pressure
and
he
ended
up
winning
by
like
18
points.
and
"now,"
he's
your
congressman.
he's
doing
a
great
job.
you
got
to
vote
for
all
these
people
on
november
"3rd,"
tom
tiffany.
thank
"you,"
tom.
and
we
have
a
great
congressional
"candidate,"
derrick
van
orden.
where's
derrick?
"derrick,"
good
luck.
i
hear
good
"things,"
derrick.
you
got
my
total
support.
i
hear
very
good
things.
i
could
only
be
supportive.
our
record
is
like
222
and
"three,"
so
i
don't
like
to
have
a
loss.
and
i
support
you
a
"100%,"
you
know
that.
you
have
my
total
"endorsement,"
all
right?
i
hear
you're
fantastic.
all
right.
and
your
former
congressman
who
i
hope
is
making
a
lot
of
money
in
the
private
sector
because
he
deserves
"it,"
especially
his
"wife,"
rachel
deserves
"it,"
she's
just
fantastic.
he's
fantastic
because
i
know
he's
coming
back
into
government
in
some
form.
he
can
come
with
us.
he
can
stay
here.
he
can
maybe
run
for
governor
or
maybe
do
"something,"
sean
duffy.
sean
duffy.
"no,"
but
he
was
the
world
champion
tree
climber.
and
i
love
"sports,"
right?
anytime
you
know
the
world
champion
at
"anything,"
but
especially
"that,"
and
i'll
never
forget.
i
was
asking
about
it.
"\"how"
was
it
"was?\""
he
"said,"
"well,"
he
broke
his
back
numerous
times.
he
broke
a
lot
of
bones.
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
ask
you
a
question.
how
much
harder
was
it
to
go
up
the
tree
than
"down?\""
he
"said,"
"\"it"
was
easy
going
"up.\""
the
hard
part
was
coming
down
because
if
he
"missed,"
that
was
where
the
danger
"was,"
right?
that
was
where
the
danger.
but
many
"times,"
world
champion.
could
you
still
do
it
today?
"\"a"
little
bit
"heavier,\""
he
said.
you
got
to
carry
a
little
bit
more
weight.
that's
all
right.
that's
not
a
good
sign
"though,"
right?
"anyway,"
great
job.
we
love
having
you
"rachel,"
thank
you
very
much.
you
are
a
friend.
fox
and
"friends,"
and
plenty
of
other
"places,"
right?
a
lot
of
"personality,"
a
lot
of
personality.
"rachel,"
she's
been
our
friend
from
day
"one,"
i
think
from
day
one.
and
her
fantastic
family
too.
"tonight,"
we're
also
praying
for
everyone
in
the
path
of
hurricane
sally.
we're
out
there
working
very
hard.
we
are
working
in
florida
and
alabama
and
georgia.
we
have
fema.
we
have
everybody
there.
we
just
finished
in
…
take
a
"look,"
we
just
went
to
"louisiana,"
texas.
we're
getting
hit
by
some
big
"hurricanes,"
but
we
have
it
under
control.
really
good.
our
coast
guard
has
been
"fantastic,"
by
the
way.
"unbelievable,"
the
bravery.
they
go
into
these
storms.
they
go
into
these
storms.
they
"say,"
"\"how"
dangerous
is
"it?\""
"\"sir,"
it's
very
"dangerous.\""
i
"say,"
"\"yeah."
all
"right.\""
he
"said,"
"\"would"
you
like
to
try
it
"sometime?\""
i
"say,"
"\"admiral,"
"no,"
thank
you.
i'll
take
a
"pass.\""
i
think
they
might
have
a
problem
with
me
doing
"it,"
but
i
will
tell
"you,"
they
are
…
in
"texas,"
they
saved
"16,000"
people
two
years
"ago,"
the
coast
"guard,"
us
coast
guard.
i
think
there's
no
brand
to
"me,"
that's
gone
up
more
than
the
us
coast
guard.
so
it's
great
that
we're
getting
them
new
ships.
those
ships
are
all
coming
in.
nice
new
"ones,"
all
built
in
the
"usa,"
beautiful
ones.
most
of
them
have
already
arrived.
my
administration
will
be
by
their
side
through
every
step.
we're
working
"again,"
"very,"
very
hard
in
the
panhandle.
the
"panhandle,"
we
love
the
panhandle.
it
got
hit
hard.
we
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
horrible
damage
joe
biden
inflicted
over
the
last
47
years.
we
passed
record
tax
cuts
and
regulation
cuts.
nobody's
ever
done
"more,"
more
than
anybody
else
has
ever
done
to
keep
our
family
farms
in
the
family.
we've
virtually
eliminated
the
unfair
estate
"tax,"
also
known
as
the
death
tax.
so
if
you
die
in
100
years
from
"now,"
and
you
have
children
who
you
love
as
opposed
to
children
that
you
can
stand
…
is
anybody
here
they
have
children
that
they
don't
"like,"
or
perhaps
can't
stand?
because
if
you
"do,"
don't
listen
to
the
rest
of
this.
but
if
you
have
a
family
that
you
love
and
you
have
a
small
business
or
farm
or
"whatever,"
they
were
being
put
out
of
business.
they'd
have
to
go
and
borrow
the
money
to
pay
the
estate
"tax,"
the
death
tax.
and
it
was
a
terrible
thing.
we
got
rid
of
"it,"
so
now
you
can
leave
your
"farm,"
your
small
business
to
your
family.
and
just
hope
they
remember
you
every
once
in
a
while.
it's
always
a
difficult
"situation,"
but
it
was.
it
was
ruining
farms.
they'd
have
to
go
out
and
sell
the
"farm,"
they'd
have
to
go
out
and
get
"partnerships,"
they'd
have
to
go
out
and
borrow
money
from
banks.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they're
in
foreclosure
proceedings
and
they've
never
done
that
before.
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
anymore.
if
you
love
your
"family,"
that's
a
big
deal.
they've
been
trying
to
get
"that,"
"sean,"
for
"what,"
30
years
they've
been
trying
to
get
"that,"
right?
especially
for
the
"farmers,"
because
it's
that
kind
of
a
business.
it's
a
great
"business,"
but
it's
day
to
day.
you
have
a
bad
"crop,"
all
of
a
sudden
you
can't
pay
interest
on
a
loan
to
pay
your
state
"tax,"
right?
and
they
lose
their
farm.
so
we're
not
going
to
have
that
anymore.
we
achieved
american
energy
independence
for
the
first
time.
totally
independent.
we
don't
have
to
be
in
those
far
away
places
unless
we
want
to
be.
biden
pledged
to
abolish
american
"oil,"
american
"jail,"
clean
"coal,"
natural
gas.
he
said
the
"fracking,"
i
told
you
"that,"
but
we're
not
going
to
let
him
get
away.
we'll
be
bringing
that
up
on
occasion.
for
47
"years,"
joe
biden
crushed
the
dreams
of
wisconsin
workers
and
enriched
foreign
countries.
that's
what
happened.
before
i
got
"here,"
what
was
happening
with
japan?
and
we
pay
our
deep
respects
to
prime
minister
abe
of
"japan,"
a
great
friend
of
all
of
"ours,"
a
great
friend
of
mine.
he's
going
to
be
leaving
office
very
"soon,"
like
in
a
matter
of
a
day.
and
he
was
a
great
gentleman.
he's
a
tough
"negotiator,"
i'll
tell
you
that.
he
made
very
good
deals
against
the
united
"states,"
but
he's
somebody
that's
going
to
be
missed.
he's
a
great
gentleman.
he
championed
every
special
"interest,"
"biden,"
every
special
interest.
and
he
sold
out
on
trade.
he
sold
out
like
almost
nobody
ever
before.
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
to
american
workers
when
we
ended
the
nafta
nightmare
and
signed
the
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
agreement
into
law.
i
saved
the
us
auto
industry
by
withdrawing
from
the
last
administration's
job
killing
"catastrophe,"
the
trans-pacific
partnership.
you
ever
hear
of
that
beauty?
that
would
have
really
hit
you.
in
"2017,"
i
signed
a
historic
executive
order
making
government
policy
to
buy
american
and
hire
american.
i'm
watching
this
biden
and
he's
got
his
sign
in
"front,"
"\"buy"
american.
"oh,"
by
"american.\""
i've
been
saying
that
for
like
20
"years,"
right?
where
the
hell
has
this
guy
been?
they
were
actually
accusing
him
of
plagiarism.
i
also
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
rampant
theft
of
wisconsin
jobs.
and
it's
all
"jobs,"
but
you
got
hit
particularly
hard.
biden
has
vowed
to
remove
those
tariffs
and
allow
china
to
resume
its
pillaging.
he
wants
to
take
the
tariffs
off
that
are
paying
us
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
a
year.
i
fought
like
hell
to
keep
them
into
the
china
deal
and
he
wants
to
remove
them.
so
tens
of
billions
of
"dollars,"
billions
and
"billions,"
i
gave
it
to
the
farmers.
i
gave
it
to
a
lot
of
"people,"
but
i
gave
most
of
it
by
"far,"
to
the
us
treasury.
he
wants
to
take
them
off.
so
let
me
just
ask
you
just
a
very
innocent
question.
there's
a
young
"man,"
about
four
years
old
up
"front,"
i
think
he
could
give
the
answer.
who
do
you
think
would
like
to
have
china?
how
do
you
think
china
would
feel
about
this
election?
in
one
"case,"
they
paid
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
a
month
to
the
us.
we
never
got
"ever,"
25
cents
from
china.
in
the
other
"case,"
he
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
take
them
"off.\""
i
think
they
might
be
inclined
to
go
for
sleepy
joe.
this
is
like
a
dream
for
china.
joe
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
china.
my
agenda
is
made
in
the
usa.
it's
very
simple.
so
we
did
many
things.
not
only
"china,"
not
only
the
$28
billion
farmers.
we
did
so
much
and
i'm
proud
to
announce
that
i'm
doing
even
more
to
support
wisconsin
farmers.
starting
next
"week,"
my
administration
is
committing
an
"additional,"
you've
been
asking
for
this
for
a
long
"time,"
$13
billion
in
relief
to
help
farmers
recover
from
the
china
"virus,"
including
wisconsin's
incredible
"dairy,"
cranberry
and
ginseng
farmers
who
got
hurt
badly.
been
after
that
money
for
a
long
time.
when
the
wisconsin
timber
industry
was
"threatened,"
i
imposed
tariffs
on
dumped
foreign
timber
and
subsidized
"products,"
saving
"many,"
many
timber
jobs
in
your
state.
if
joe
biden
gets
"in,"
the
radical
left
will
shut
down
wisconsin's
timber
production
for
environmental
reasons.
do
you
believe
that?
"oh,"
boy.
it's
so
sad
to
see
"it,"
and
that
would
happen.
but
we
can't
let
that
happen.
we've
come
too
far.
we're
so
good.
if
that
virus
hadn't
hit
"us,"
and
it
"did,"
and
it
hit
the
whole
"world,"
but
if
it
hadn't
hit
"us,"
we
would
have
numbers
the
likes
of
which
nobody
thought
were
even
remotely
possible.
but
it
"did,"
and
we
saved
a
lot
of
lives.
they
keep
"saying,"
"\"oh,"
they
just
"…\""
by
the
"way,"
if
we
had
two
people
"die,"
they
would
have
said
he
did
a
terrible
job.
if
we
had
100
people
"die,"
if
we
had
"1000,"
no
matter
what
we
do.
we
have
trade
deals.
we
announced
a
trade
"deal,"
everybody
is
saying
how
great
it
is.
schumer
and
pelosi
see
"it,"
they
have
no
idea
what
the
deal
"is,"
"\"we"
don't
like
the
"deal.\""
did
you
look
at
it?
"\"oh,"
of
"course,"
we
looked
at
it.
it
doesn't
have
tariffs.
oh
"no,"
it
does
have
"tariffs.\""
they
know
nothing
about
the
deal.
"automatically,"
anything
we
"do,"
they
just
take
the
reverse.
but
you
know
what?
i'd
probably
do
it
to
them
"too,"
so
i
can't
complain.
and
perhaps
no
issue
have
our
opponents
more
thoroughly
betrayed
working
families
of
all
backgrounds
than
on
the
subject
of
immigration.
under
my
"administration,"
we've
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
we
ended
the
catch
and
release.
you
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
you
catch
up
"them,"
they
may
be
a
"killer,"
they
may
be
a
criminal
at
the
highest
"order,"
you
take
their
name.
then
you're
supposed
to
bring
them
to
a
"court,"
like
perry
"mason,"
right?
but
we
actually
catch
"them,"
take
their
"name,"
release
"them,"
"say,"
"\"come"
back
in
about
four
years
for
your
court
"case.\""
we
ended
all
this
stuff.
and
you
think
that
was
easy?
it
wasn't
"easy,"
let
me
tell
you.
it
was
"tough,"
but
we
have
a
really
"good,"
secure
border.
and
the
president
of
mexico
has
been
terrific.
we
right
now
have
"27,000"
soldiers
from
mexico
guarding
our
"border,"
free
of
charge.
we
stopped
asylum
"fraud,"
and
we've
deported
"20,000"
gang
members
and
over
a
half
a
million
criminal
illegal
aliens
of
the
worst
kind.
we're
enforcing
the
clear
requirement
that
newcomers
to
our
country
must
be
financially
self-sufficient
and
not
reliant
on
welfare.
they
have
to
sign
a
document.
we
invested
$2.
5
trillion
in
the
us
"military,"
including
major
contracts
to
build
new
warships
that
helped
save
the
historic
shipyard
in
marinette.
how
about
that?
i
was
there
two
months
ago.
marinette.
that's
a
great
"company,"
but
it
was
having
a
hard
time.
and
"now,"
they're
"building,"
what
was
"that,"
like
$6
billion
worth
of
ships?
and
their
beauties.
they've
started
"already,"
and
we
worked
very
hard
on
that.
and
we
had
a
lot
of
help
from
your
congressman
on
that
"one,"
because
a
lot
of
people
wanted
that
contract.
but
we
got
it
for
"wisconsin,"
remember
that.
we
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
in
nearly
75
years.
that's
"right,"
the
space
force.
the
fact
"is,"
and
somebody
said
it
on
the
other
"side,"
an
opponent
said
whether
you
like
it
or
"not,"
trump
actually
did
more
as
president
than
he
promised
during
the
campaign.
like
space
"force,"
that's
a
big
deal.
think
of
it;
"army,"
"navy,"
air
"force,"
marine.
…
think
of
"it,"
"army,"
"navy,"
air
"force,"
"marines,"
coast
"guard,"
right.
think
of
it.
i
"mean,"
that's
all
you
heard
your
whole
"life,"
right.
the
"army,"
the
"navy,"
the
air
"force,"
the
"marines,"
coast
guard;
and
"now,"
we
have
the
space
force.
you
know
what
a
big
"deal,"
first
time
in
75
"years,"
it's
a
new
one.
last
one
was
75
years
ago.
the
air
"force,"
right.
that's
a
big
thing.
i
never
talked
about
that
on
the
"campaign,"
i
never
even
thought
about
it.
when
i
became
"president,"
i
"said,"
"\"we"
have
to
do
"this.\""
because
i
saw
what
russia
was
"doing,"
and
i
saw
what
china
was
doing.
"and,"
they've
created
their
space
"forces,"
i
"said,"
"\"what"
are
we
going
to
"do?,"
not
have
"it.\""
it's
going
to
end
up
being
maybe
your
most
important
or
certainly
one
of
your
most
important
because
that's
where
it's
"at,"
in
terms
of
"defense,"
in
terms
of
offense.
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
accountability
for
our
great
veterans
that
we
had
the
other
day.
veterans
"satisfaction,"
91
"percent,"
the
highest
score
we've
ever
received.
you
haven't
"noticed,"
remember
years
"ago,"
every
"story,"
every
"night,"
the
nightly
"news,"
you'd
always
have
horrible
stories
about
the
"va,"
you
don't
see
it
anymore.
"now,"
i
don't
want
to
give
them
any
"ideas,"
because
they'll
search
all
over
the
country
for
a
vet
who's
unhappy.
i'm
hurting
myself
by
telling
this
story.
this
is
not
a
good
story.
but
remember
"that,"
every
night
you'd
have
these
horror
stories
about
the
va.
you
don't
see
that
anymore.
91
percent

i
kept
my
promise
recognized
the
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights
and
we
achieve
the
first
breakthrough
in
the
middle
east
peace;
"and,"
you
saw
that
two
days
"ago,"
"uae,"
"bahrain,"
"israel,"
nobody
thought
it
was
even
possible.
i
saw
john
kerry
on
television
the
other
day.
"\"it"
is
not
"possible.\""
then
we
waited
a
little
while.
he
went
"very,"
very
"strong,"
"\"it"
is
not
"possible.\""
"and,"
it
was
not
only
"possible,"
we
have
many
countries
that
are
joining
us
very
soon.
we
killed
the
founder
and
the
"leader,"
the
vicious
leader
of
"isis,"
"al-baghdadi,"
we
killed
him.
"and,"
we
also
took
out
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murder
of
american
troops
and
"many,"
many
troops
and
many
"people,"
all
over
the
world.
qasem
soleimani
is
"dead,"
he's
"dead,"
bad
"guy,"
bad
"guy,"
very
bad
guy.
we
kept
america
out
of
new
wars
and
we're
bringing
our
troops
back
home.
no
one
has
been
more
"wrong,"
more
often
than
sleepy
joe
biden.
he
voted
for
the
iraq
"war,"
he
supported
the
defense
sequester
that
gutted
our
military.
i
took
over
a
military
that
was
totally
"depleted,"
like.
hillary
clinton
"deleted,"
as
opposed
to
"depleted,"
she
depleted
them
too;
"but,"
she
deleted
"33,000"
emails.
when
is
somebody
going
to
pull
the
spring?
"ah,"
come
on
fellows.
"no,"
that's
terrible.
"33,000"
emails.
try
going
to
court
sometime
on
a
civil
"case,"
and
when
you
go
before
the
"judge,"
he'll
"say,"
"\"did"
you
delete
those
"emails?\""
"\"did"
you
get
rid
of
those
"texts?\""
"\"did"
you
"this…,"
"right.\""
"and,"
now
they
caught
weissmann
and
all
these
guys
cleaning
their
phones
because
they
were
under
"investigation,"
and
they
cleaned
their
phones.
how
many
were
there?
"21,"
but
they
were
like
33
phones.
and
"yet,"
look
what
they
do
to
general
"flynn,"
and
some
of
these
people
that
did
nothing.
they
cleaned
their
"criminals,"
"yeah,"
that's
"criminal,"
it's
"criminal,"
they're
criminals.
they
talk
and
talk
and
"talk,"
they're
criminals.
they
clean
their
"phone,"
so
you
don't
have
any
of
the
"information,"
but
that's
a
big
problem
for
"them,"
i
would
imagine.
it's
a
disgrace
that
they
can
do
it.
"but,"
hillary
got
rid
of…
she
deleted
and
"acid-wash,"
right.
who
acid-washed?
did
you
ever…
"and,"
she
also
used
to
bang
them
with
a
"hammer,"
remember
"that,"
we
forgot
"that,"
right.
"so,"
let's
see
what
happens
with
all
of
that
stuff.
i
think
bill
barr's
doing
an
excellent
"job,"
i
have
to
tell
you.
"and,"
he's
fighting
a
very
bad
establishment
in
washington.
there's
some
bad
apples
in
that
whole
deal.
"but,"
if
you
think
that
biden
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
of
osama
bin
"laden,"
he
was
against
it.
he
opposed
the
killing
of
soleimani.
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
"isis,"
what
a
mistake.
"and,"
he
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
very
positive
development
for
america
and
the
"world,"
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
it's
not
been
too
positive.
if
it
were
up
to
"sleepy,"
joe
"biden,"
bin
ladin
and
"soleimani,"
would
be
alive.
isis
would
still
be
on
the
rampage
and
china
would
now
be
the
dominant
power
in
the
world
and
there
not
even
"close,"
i
will
tell
you.
we
have
"weaponry,"
the
likes
of
which
nobody's
seen.
2.5
trillion
buys
you
some
good
"stuff,"
especially
when
we
have
the
finest
scientific
minds
and
military
minds
in
the
world.
we
have
"weapons,"
the
likes
of
which
nobody's
"seen,"
and
just
hope
to
"god,"
we
never
have
to
use
them.
i
say
"that,"
and
i
"say,"
it's
strongly.
hope
that
we
never
have
to
use
them.
my
attitude
was
"that,"
and
i've
learned
this
a
long
time
"ago,"
by
having
"them,"
we
keep
ourselves
out
of
"war,"
as
opposed
to
bringing
ourselves
in
war.
"but,"
we
have
built
and
created
"weapons,"
the
likes
of
which
this
world
has
never
seen
before.
"and,"
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
it
too
"much,"
nor
do
i
really
want
to
talk
about
it.
when
i
ban
travel
from
"china,"
biden
called
it
hysterical
and
"xenophobic,"
he
"said,"
"\"he's"
"xenophobic.\""
what
does
that
mean?
"joe,"
tell
me.
biden
also
opposed
my
plan
to
ban
"europe,"
i
saw
what
was
happening
in
france
and
spain
and
"italy,"
and
highly
"infected,"
we
banned
europe.
if
we
had
insisted
and
listened
to
joe
and
insisted
on
doing
what
so
many
other
people
said
"doing,"
which
"is,"
"\"you"
don't
have
to
do
the
"ban.\""
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
americans
would
have
died
from
the
plague.
biden
was
willing
to
sacrifice
american
"lives,"
on
the
altar
of
open
borders.
and
"now,"
i
hear
him
"talking,"
he
should
have
followed
me.
this
guy
did
the
swine
"flu,"
"right,"
it
was
a
catastrophe.
"and,"
the
man
that
headed
up
the
swine
"flu,"
i
won't
use
his
name
because
i'd
like
to
have
him
have
a
nice
"evening,"
because
i
can't
imagine
the
democrats
are
thrilled.
he
"said,"
"\"it"
was
a
horrible
"job,"
we
had
no
idea
what
we
were
"doing,"
it
was
a
"disaster.\""
he
"said,"
"\"it"
was
a
"disaster.\""
and
"now,"
biden's
telling
us
how
to
do
what
we're
doing
so
well
"on,"
what
other
countries
are
calling
me
and
congratulating
me
on
the
incredible
job.
and
i
got
"sleepy,"
joe
"biden,"
trying
to
tell
me
how
to
do
it.
"and,"
his
own
man
who
headed
it
"up,"
swine
"flu,"
it's
h1n1
swine
flu.
joe
called
"it,"
n1h1.
i
keep
saying
"joe,"
"joe,"
it's
"h1n1,"
right.
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
easier
to
remember
because
h
comes
before
"n,\""
but
he
can't
do
it.
and
"then,"
you
saw
what
he
said
the
other
day
under
a
harris-biden
administration.
that
was
a
disaster.
i
never
said
under
a
pence
trump
"administration,"
he
"said,"
"\"under"
a
harris-biden
"administration.\""
"and,"
what
made
it
"worse,"
is
she
said
the
same
thing.
that
was
"terrible,"
right.
"sean,"
right.
did
you
hear
that?
they
are
a
disaster
together.
through
our
historic
relief
"programs,"
we
saved
more
than
1
million
wisconsin
jobs
and
"87,000"
wisconsin
"businesses,"
that's
not
too
bad.
"and,"
biden
would
demolish
all
of
those
"games,"
and
we've
done
similar
things
in
other
states.
he
would
destroy
your
social
"security,"
totally
destroy
"it,"
and
destroy
protections
for
preexisting
conditions.
they
want
to
go
to
social
"medicine,"
they
want
to
go
to
social…
you
know
"that,"
right.
you
do
know
that.
they
want
social
healthcare
where
you
don't…
remember
obama
28
"times,"
you
can
keep
your
"doctor,"
you
can
keep
your
"plan,"
that
didn't
work
out
too
"well,"
right.
why
haven't
they
looked
into
that
"one,"
28
times.
"well,"
under
medicare
for
"all,"
but
it's
basically
socialized
"healthcare,"
you
will
never
have
your
"doctor,"
you
will
never
have
your
plan.
you'll
have
horrible
healthcare.
you're
going
to
wait
long
"times,"
long
times.
"and,"
he
wants
to
wipe
out
180
million
private
healthcare
plans
that
people
"love,"
180
million
plans.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
he's
going
to
make
it.
how
do
you
get
elected?
let's
say
you're
"doing,"
not
only
"here,"
let's
say
"texas,"
"right,"
he's
against
"oil,"
he's
against
god
and
he's
against
guns.
that's
a
tough
combination
in
texas.
how
does
that
apply?
"now,"
he's
against
religion.
they
won't
open
these
blue
"states,"
they
will
not
open
your
churches.
they
won't
open
them.
"and,"
i
think
they
have
an
ulterior
motive.
one
thing
they
have
"is,"
probably
everything
opens
on
november
"4th,"
you
understand
that.
"and,"
they
better
be
"careful,"
those
paper
ballots
you
talk
"about,"
a
bad
"thing,"
just
get
out
and
"vote,"
get
out
and
vote.
"and,"
if
you
have
to
go
that
"route,"
make
sure
they
have
it
counted.
"and,"
they
know
it's
trouble.
they
just
had
another
election
"today,"
"fellows,"
where
it's
a
disaster.
the
votes
come
"in,"
they
have
no
"idea,"
they
can't
count
them.
"and,"
i
don't
mean
they're
off
by
a
little
"bit,"
they're
off
by
20
"percent,"
25
percent.
there's
fraud.
there's
missing
ballots.
they
have
a
woman
in
new
york
who
is
a
terrible
"congresswoman,"
you
know
that.
carolyn
maloney.
they
gave
her
an
"election,"
they
can't
even
find
the
ballots.
"and,"
they
gave
her
a
"victory,"
and
they
cant
find
that
the
guy
that
is
against
"her,"
who
did
very
"well,"
even
though
he's
even
more
"progressive,"
i
don't
even
know
what
she
is.
i've
known
her
for
25
years.
i
don't
think
she's
progressive.
i
think
she's
whatever
she
has
to
be.
but
this
"guy,"
probably
or
possibly
beat
her.
"so,"
rightfully
he's
not
too
happy.
"and,"
they
called
the
election
for
her
and
they
can't
find
the
ballots.

i

he's

that's
the

i
predict

they
did

i
know

i
was
telling

much
more

even

"bernie,"

in

they've
got

in

"but,"
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world.
"and,"
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we'll
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
"states,"

right
here
in

state

wisconsin.
we

happening
very
"fast,"

and
the

will
be
even
greater

hire
more

increase
penalties
on

of
law
"enforcement,"
surge
federal
prosecutors
into
high
crime
communities.
"and,"
we
will
ban
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
are
deadly.
we
will
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
and
justices
who
believe
in
enforcing
the
"law,"
not
their
own
political
agenda.
we
will
ensure
equal
justice
for
citizens
of

out

you
remember
with
"me,"
they
thought
because
of
my
"personality,"
they
"said,"
"\"he'll"
be
in
war
the
first
"week.\""
what
happened
to
the
war?
"remember,"
we
were
going
to
be
in
war
with
north
korea.
hillary
would
have
been
in
war
with
north
korea.
it
would
have
been
a
nasty
one
too.
but
"remember,"
everybody
"said,"
i
was
going
to
be
in
war.
everybody
"said,"
"\"oh,"
maybe
i'll
do
something
with
social
"security.\""
"and,"
i
did.
i
saved
it
and
made
it
stronger.
and
"now,"
i'm
going
to
make
it
even
stronger.
"and,"
they're
going
to
get
rid
of
your
social
security
because
everything's
going
to
come
collapsing
down.
you
will
have
a
depression.
if
he
gets
"in,"
they're
going
to
raise

they're
going

raise
your

you
will
have
a
depression.

of
which
this
country
has
never
seen
before.
"and,"
your
401k's
and
your
stocks
and
jobs
will
go
down
in
flames.
i
just
say
it
"here,"
hopefully
we're
never
going
to
experience
"it,"
but
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military
"might,"
and
we
will
ensure
peace
through
strength.
we
will
end

medical
"billing,"
require

i've
already
signed.

the
costs

coming
down
now.
you
"know,"
i
signed
favored
nations
"clauses,"
their
drug
companies
are
not
happy
with
"me,"
i
will
tell
you.
they
never
thought
it
was
possible
and
rebate
clauses.
they
never
thought
anybody
would
do
that
to
them.
they
made
enough
money
for
a
long
time.
it's
"time,"
you
got
a
big
break.
we
will
strongly
protect
medicare
and
social
security.
"and,"
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
"conditions,"
"always,"
you
have
a
pledge.
we
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on

"and,"
nasa
is
now
the
hottest
space
center
anywhere
in
the
world.
"and,"
when
i
took
over
three
and
a
half
years
"ago,"
there
was
grass
growing
in
the
"runways,"
you
know
that
it
was
closed
"down,"
it
was
a
mess.
we
are
now
the
hottest
in
the
world.
you
see
what's
going
up.
"and,"
we've
got
a
lot
of
rich
guys
sending
them
up
too.
i
liked
that
better.
i
"said,"
"\"let"
them
do
"it.\""
rich
guys
like
"rockets,"
i
don't
"know,"
they
like
"rocket,"
boom.
i
see
dollars
going
right
"up,"
but
they
need
a
good
place
to
launch.
we
have
the
best
places.
we
have
the
best
"places,"
so
it's
been
incredible
what
we've
done
with
nasa.
we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students
and
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools.
we're
already
there
again.
we
will
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
history
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
"and,"
we
will
live
by
the
timeless
works
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
trust.

"[well,"
i
thank
you
very
much.
so
i
want
to
start
by
"saying,"
"\"hello,"
nevada.
how
are
you
doing?
how
are
"you?\""
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
in
douglas
"county,"
but
people
are
coming
from
all
over
the
place.
there's
a
lot
of
people
for
douglas
"county,"
isn't
it?
we
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
"loyal,"
hardworking
american
"patriots,"
that's
what
we
have.
and
52
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
"nevada,"
and
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
and
then
after
that
we'll
"negotiate,"
right?
‘cause
we're
"probably,"
based
on
the
way
we
were
"treated,"
we're
probably
entitled
to
another
four
after
that.
and
it
should
never
happen
to
another

that's
just
a
dishonest
group
of

we
"are,"

we're
going

be
here

another
four
years.
the
governor
of
your
state-
…
tried
very
hard
to
stop
us
from
having
this
event
tonight.
he
didn't
like
us
having…
they
can
have
riots
and
they
can
have
all
sorts
of
things
and
that's
"okay,"
you
can
burn
up
the
"house,"
that's
okay.
we
call
this
a
protest
because
if
you
call
it
a
"protest,"
you're
allowed
to
have
it.
it's
okay.
so
if
anybody
asks
you
"outside,"
this
is
called
a
friendly
"protest,"
okay?
it's
true.
you
can't
have
political
rallies.
that's
because
of
"me,"
because
if
biden
were
"here,"
he'd
have
about
three
people.
do
you
ever
see
him
with
his
little
circles?
the
circle?
you
know
why
he
puts
the
circles?
because
he
wants
to
be
like
correct
with
"covid,"
but
it's
not
really
because
they
can't
get
anybody
to
fill
up
a
room.
so
they
put
these
big
circles.
so
he
can't
get
anybody
to
fill.
nobody
wants
to
go.
"oh,"
"boy,"
the
fake
"news,"
look
at
all
those
people
back
"there,"
the
fakers.
that's
true.
"boy,"
they
covered.
did
you
see
the
other
"day,"
now
they're
finding
out
that
to
do
an
"interview,"
an
"interview,"
they
ask
him
a
question.
that
means
they're
giving
him
the
"questions,"
they
never
gave
me
questions
before.
so
to
do
an
"interview,"
he
demands
on
getting
the
"questions,"
and
his
people
write
out
the
answer.
so
they
ask
him
a
question.
he
"goes,"
"\"bring"
it
up
"closer,"
i
can't
see
"it,"
"dammit.\""
great.
this
is
something.
you
"know,"
we
have
a
debate
coming
up
in
three
weeks.
and
here's
the
problem.
winston
churchill.
did
you
ever
hear
of
winston
churchill?
winston
churchill
was
a
great
debater.
great.
and
if
joe
gets
off
the
"stage,"
walks
off
the
"stage,"
if
he
makes
"it,"
which
i
think
he
probably
"will,"
in
all
"fairness,"
he's
been
doing
this
for
47
"years,"
right?
i
think
he
probably
will.
if
he
gets
off
the
"stage,"
they're
going
to
say
it
was
the
single
greatest
debate
they've
ever
seen.
winston
churchill
was
nothing
compared
to
sleepy
joe.
you
know
"that,"
you
know
"that,"
they're
going
to
"say,"
"\"what"
a
great
performance.
he
was
great
today.
he
was
great.
this
guy
was
"great.\""
"nah,"
he's
not
great.
but
your
governor
tried
to
stop
us.
he
tried
to
stop
us.
the
governor
of
"nevada,"
he
tried
to
stop
"us,"
and
we
went
to
different
venues.
kelly
"o'donnell,"
she's
a
fading
reporter
for
nbc.
do
you
know
that?
she
was
"on,"
she
"said,"
"\"well,"
they
have
a
crowd
"tonight.\""
behind
"her,"
it
looked
like
"25,000"
people.
that's
what
we
"have,"
by
the
"way,"
a
lot
more
coming
in.
but
she
"said,"
"\"he's"
got
maybe
a
thousand
"people,"
a
"thousand.\""
you
know
what
i
got?
i
have
a
thousand
people
here.
"no,"
this
is
the
fake
news.
you
know
what?
it's
not
a
question
of
how
many…
they
are
just
a
bunch
of
dishonest
"people,"
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
being
in
real
estate
and
being
in
new
york
and
being
in
all
"over,"
i've
seen
a
lot
of
dishonest
people.
i
think
the
"media,"
the
fake
news
is
the
most
dishonest
group
of
people
i've
ever
seen
anywhere
in
my
entire
life.
and
that
"includes,"
by
the
"way,"
leaders
of
foreign
countries
that
aren't
our
"friends,"
okay?
that's
a
big
statement.
they
really
are
bad
news.
but
here
we
"are,"
and
this
is
really
amazing.
the
governor
tried
to
stop
"us,"
he
"couldn't,"
but
think
of
"this,"
he's
in
control
of
millions
of
votes.
here's
a
guy
calling
"venues,"
telling
them
not
to
have
the
"rally,"
calling
different
"venues,"
"\"don't"
have
the
rally.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
have
the
"rally.\""
and
he's
"calling,"
this
governor
who
was
a
political
"hack,"
he
was
a
political
"hack,"
and
then
he
became
governor.
and
this
is
the
guy
that
we're
entrusting
with
millions
of
"ballots,"
unsolicited
"ballots,"
millions
and
millions.
and
then
we're
supposed
to
win
these
"states,"
and
we
have
a
guy
that
would
do
that
where
he
won't
let
us
"have,"
and
we
call
it
a
protest
and
therefore
we
can
do
it.
but
you
want
to
know
something?
it's
a
disgrace.
so
who
the
hell
is
going
to
trust?
they
"say,"
"\"trust"
"government.\""
"well,"
how
would
you
trust
a
guy
that
fought
that
we
aren't
"here,"
that
we
can't
have
all
these
thousands
of
people?
"boy,"
you
are
really
back
far.
that's…
look
at
that.
"no,"
but
seriously.
and
now
he's
in
charge
of
the
election
and
the
millions
of
ballots.
so
if
i'm
up
like
millions
of
"votes,"
he
can
rig
the
"election,"
he
can
rig
the
election.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
whether
it's
in
north
"carolina,"
whether
it's
in
"michigan,"
whether
it's
in
other
states
where
they're
sending
"out,"
they're
going
to
be
sending
out
80
million
ballots.
and
it's
democrats.
they're
trying
to
rig
this
"election,"
at
every
single
place
in
the
last
"year,"
year
and
a
"half,"
go
modern
"day,"
forget
about…
tiny
"amounts,"
a
congressional
race
in
new
"york,"
a
small
number
of
votes.
if
you
go
to
new
"jersey,"
if
you
go
to
"virginia,"
if
you
go
to
"pennsylvania,"
if
you
go
to
"california,"
look
at
some
of
these
"races,"
every
one
of
these
races
was
a
"fraud,"
missing
ballots.
and
i
don't
mean
like
1%.
i
mean
like
"20%,"
"25%,"
they're
trying
to
rig
the
election.
they
should
make
"people,"
if
you
"register,"
if
you
want
a
solicited
"ballot,"
that's
where
you
ask
for
it.
you
have
to
sign
papers.
you
get
it
because
you
can't
be
there.
that's
one
thing.
when
they
send
80
million
ballots
to
"people,"
they
have
no
idea
where
they're
going.
"actually,"
they
probably
do
have
a
good
idea
where
they're
"going,"
and
that's
our
problem.
they
send
80
million
ballots
out.
where
are
they
going?
who
are
they
sending
them
to?
are
they
sending
them
to
certain
areas
and
not
other
areas?
are
they
sending
them
to
democrat
areas?
these
are
all
controlled
by
democrat
"governors,"
like
your
politically
motivated
governor.
"so,"
just
to
finish
on
"that,"
"look,"
just
to
finish
on
"that,"
he's
a
guy
that
tried
to
silence
us
by
not
having
this.
and
it
ended
"up,"
our
crowd
turned
out
to
be
a
lot
bigger
than
"nbc,"
which
is
owned
by
concast.
"c-o-n,"
concast.
"c-o-n-c-a-s-t,"
concast.
it's
really
"comcast,"
but
i
call
it
con
because
it's
a
whole
con.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
in
the
old
"days,"
i
think
it
should
still
"be,"
news
when
they
broadcast
had
to
be
reasonably
"accurate,"
right?
and
they
had
licensing.
"today,"
they
can
do
whatever
the
hell
they
want.
it's
fake
"news,"
and
it's
a
disgrace.
and
you
know
"what,"
back
"there,"
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
it's
hurting
our
country.
it's
hurting
our
country.
they're
the
biggest
problem
that
this
country
has
is
the
fake
news
"media,"
worse
than
the
"democrats,"
because
the
democrats
are
their
partners.
they
play
together.
joe
biden
spent
the
last
47
years
selling
out
"america,"
offshoring
your
"jobs,"
throwing
open
your
"borders,"
depleting
our
military
and
sacrificing
your
children's
future
in
china.
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
bringing
our
jobs
back
to
"america,"
securing
our
"borders,"
rebuilding
our
military
and
standing
up
to
china
like
never
before.
nobody
has
ever
stood
up
to
china
like
we
have
stood
up
to
"china,"
and
you
haven't
seen
the
last
of
it.
sleepy
joe
"biden,"
who
"surrendered,"
you
know
where
he
is
"now,"
he's
in
his
damn
basement
again.
"no,"
he's
in
his
basement.
he's
in
his
basement.
but
i
can
be
bad
to
him
because
he
put
the
most
vicious
ad
on
television
that
i've
ever
seen.
do
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
where
i'm
standing
over
the
graves
of
our
fallen
"warriors,"
our
fallen
heroes.
these
are
great
"people,"
the
greatest
people
there
"are,"
and
i'm
standing
over
there
and
they
have
some
sleazebag
reporter
from
a
third
rate
magazine
having
some
source
quoting
me
"saying,"
i
won't
even
use
the
"term,"
but
saying
bad
things.
and
there's
nobody
that
loves
our
"military,"
respects
it
and
the
people
more
than
me.
and
they
took…
and
i
didn't
even
ask.
we
had
25
people
that
were
witnesses
that
are
on
the
record
already
that
have
said
that
never
took
place.
it
never
took
"place,"
what
they
said.
and
yet
pathetic
"joe,"
and
he's
a
pathetic
human
being
to
allow
that
to
happen.
here's
the
"problem,"
he
doesn't
even
know
what
"happened,"
i
don't
think.
i
think
he
has
no
"idea,"
but
he's
a
pathetic
human
being
to
let
that
"happen,"
where
they
put
an
ad
like
"that,"
where
i'm
standing
over
graves.
and
then
they
"said,"
"\"he"
said
"this,\""
with
no
"sources,"
no
nothing.
they
got
nothing.
and
i
have
25
real
witnesses
with
the
"names,"
with
"everything,"
saying
it
never
happened.
and
they
put
an
ad
like
that
"up,"
they're
a
disgrace.
but
you
know
the
good
part?
now
i
can
be
really
vicious.
i
can
be
really
vicious.
and
we'll
start
by
"saying,"
we're
going
to
start
by
saying
that
the
democrats
are
trying
to
rig
this
election
because
it's
the
only
way
they're
going
to
win.
the
only
way
they're
going
to
win
is
to
rig
it.
biden's
surrendered
your
jobs
to
china.
"look,"
his
son
walked
away
with
a
billion
and
a
half
"dollars,"
give
me
a
"break,"
give
me
a…
his
son's
going
to
"say,"
"\"dad,"
you
can't
take
this
money
away.
don't
do
"it,"
"dad,"
"please,"
i
"don't…\""
you
know
how
much
experience
he
had?
there's
a
young
man
"here,"
he's
a
very
"young,"
young
"man,"
handsome
young
guy.
he's
about
like
12.
you
know
what?
he's
got
more
experience
than
hunter.
hunter.
where's
hunter?
where
is
he?
with
no
"experience,"
no
knowledge
of
"energy,"
no
"job,"
got
thrown
out
of
the
military…
you
know
he
got
thrown
"out,"
by
the
way.
i
used
to
be
nice
about
that.
now
i
don't.
once
i
saw
that
"ad,"
i
don't
have
to
be
nice
anymore.
"okay,"
i
really
mean
it.
and
by
the
"way,"
on
that
"ad,"
i
know
some
horrible
"people,"
horrible
human
"beings,"
some
of
the
worst
people
in
the
"world,"
i
really
"do,"
they're
"horrible,"
none
of
those
"people,"
and
they're
the
"worst,"
the
"worst,"
real
estate
developers
in
new
"york,"
you
don't
get
much
worse.
i
know
some
of
the
worst
people
in
the
"world,"
not
one
person
do
i
know
that
would
say
"that,"
standing
on
top
of
"graves,"
of
"heroes,"
"really,"
not
one
person.
so
i
will
tell
you
"this,"
so
now
we
can
play
it
like
it
is.
let's
face
"it,"
joe
is
shot.
let's
face
"it,"
okay?
he's
shot.
so
not
that
he
has
anything
to
do
because
he
won't
know
what's
happening.
he'll
just
be
locked
up
in
a
room
"someplace,"
and
the
radical
left
is
going
to
be
running
our
country.
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
"years,"
four
more
years!
thank
you.
but
now
he
wants
to
surrender
our
country
to
the
violent
left
wing
mob.
you
know
that.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
mob
wins.
you
see
what's
going
on
with
all
these
democratic
or
i
always
say
democrat-run
cities
and
states.
it's
a
disaster.
it's
a
disaster.
and
we
keep
"saying,"
"\"let"
us
bring
in
the
"troops.\""
"well,"
we
did
it
in
"minneapolis,"
we
ended
it.
in
45
"minutes,"
it
was
ended.
they
went
through
two
weeks.
by
the
"way,"
we
could
do
it
in
portland
in
half
an
hour.
it
would
all
be
over.
but
we
have
these
stupid
people
that
think…
how
about
that
poor
mayor?
is
that
"pathetic,"
"wheeler,"
is
that
pathetic?
they
forced
him
out
of
his
home.
he's
now
finding
a
new
"home,"
it's
so
nice.
it's
pathetic.
"honestly,"
it's
pathetic.
we
could
solve
that
problem
in
a
half
an
"hour,"
just
like
we
did.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
us
marshals
did
a
great
job
in
portland.
they
did
a
great
job.
you
know
what
i
mean.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
rioters
"win,"
the
anarchists
"win,"
"arsonists,"
flag
"burners,"
they
all
win.
i'm
running
for
reelection
to
bring
prosperity
to
"nevada,"
to
the
whole
country.
i've
been
here
a
long
time.
i
have
some
things
in
nevada
that
are
very
good
to
put
violent
criminals
behind
bars
and
to
ensure
the
future
belongs
to
"america,"
not
to
china.
i
do
get
a
kick
out
of
watching
a
"guy,"
"\"oh,"
i'm
going
to
do
"this.\""
he
copied
my
whole
plan.
you
"see,"
he
"says,"
"\"buy"
"america,\""
i
"said,"
"\"where"
the
hell
have
you
been
for
the
last
half
"century?\""
thank
you.
could
i
ask
the
fake
news
to
take
your
cameras
and
show
all
the
way
back
there
for
hundreds
of
"yards,"
all
the
way
back
there.
take
your
cameras.
go
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see.
"no,"
"no,"
tell
nbc
news
it's
not
a
thousand
people.
you
can't
see
it.
you
can't
see
it
down
here.
you
won't
believe
how
many
people.
that
thing
goes
back…
so
the
bottom
line
is
when
we
"win,"
america
"wins,"
that's
what's
happening.
and
nobody's
done
to
china
what
i
did.
"look,"
"billions,"
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
tariffs
we
took
in.
i
gave
$28
billion
to
farmers.
the
farmers
are
doing
very
well.
they're
doing
very
well.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
president
trump.
28
billion.
16
billion
one
year
12
billion.
they
were
targeted.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
is
"it?\""
sonny
"perdue,"
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
great
"guy,"
"said,"
"\"how"
much
were
they
hurt
"by?\""
"\"sir,"
12
billion
two
years
ago
and
16
billion
last
"year.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
good.
we'll
take
it
out
of
"china.\""
we
gave
them
28
"billion,"
to
the
farmers.
that
never
happened
before.
you
think
joe
biden
would
even
think
about
it?
he
wouldn't
even
think
about
it.
he
wouldn't
even
think
about
it.
"no,"
he's
more
worried
"about,"
does
he
have
a
teleprompter
to
answer
a
reporter's
question.
the
worst
part
about
that
isn't
the
fact
that
he's
doing
"that,"
because
let's
face
"it,"
he's
"unable,"
okay?
it's
not
"that,"
it's
that
the
fake
news
would
give
him
the
questions.
they
never
gave
me
the
questions.
did
you
ever
give
me
"questions,"
back
there?
did
you
ever
give
me…
they
don't
give
me
questions.
the
fake
news
would
give
him
"questions,"
but
of
course
now
donna
brazile
works
for
"fox,"
so
that's
gone
a
long
way.
remember?
remember
when
donna
brazile
gave
crooked
hillary
the
"questions,"
right?
to
a
debate?
and
then
she
"said,"
"\"well,"
i
don't
think
i
did
it.
i
don't
"remember.\""
i
knew
she
was
in
trouble
when
she
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
remember
doing
that.
i
don't
"remember.\""
she
didn't
remember.
"oh,"
okay.
"well,"
as
long
as
you
don't
remember.
it's
true.
it's
true
too.
it's
true.
you
know
"what,"
i
used
to
stand
back
and
i'd
"say,"
"\"be"
"quiet,"
please.
don't
say
that.
it's
really
not
"nice.\""
you
know
it's
true.
she
deleted
33…
think
of
it.
they'll
never
find
the
emails
because
they
were
acid
"washed,"
deleted.
but
you
know
what?
she
got
a
subpoena
from
the
united
states
"congress,"
right?
and
she
and
her
lawyer
deleted
"33,000"
emails
after
she
got
a
united
states
subpoena.
and
you
"say,"
"\"why"
isn't
she
guilty
of
a
major
"crime?\""
right?
and
then
she
took
her
telephones
and
she
smashed
them
with
a
hammer.
right?
and
then
she
took
the
other
"ones,"
and
she
deleted
them.
and
now
the
mueller
"scam,"
these
"people,"
the
worst
people.
i
have
a
"friend,"
a
very
smart
"guy,"
very
streetwise
guy.
he
"said,"
"\"you"
have
to
be
the
most
honest
guy
in
the
world
to
go
through
three
years
of
"investigations,"
where
they
have
the
worst
human
beings
in
the
"world.\""
they
worked
for
the
democrats.
they
worked…
i
"mean,"
mueller
didn't
have
a
clue.
this
guy
was
totally…
but
look
at
this
"weissmann,"
how
bad
was
weissmann?
he
deleted
his
phone.
that's
illegal.
he
deleted
everything.
they
all
deleted.
and
they
all
"said,"
"\"oh"
"gee,"
we
made
a
mistake.
we're
"sorry.\""
they
all
used
the
same
mistake.
they
all
made…
it
"was,"
"\"oh"
"gee,"
we
didn't
mean
to
do
"that.\""
every
one
of
"them,"
all
of
them.
i
think
it
was
31
different
"phones,"
they
deleted.
these
are
criminals
we're
dealing
with.
and
they've
got
to…
there
has
to
be
a
repercussion.
there
has
to
be
a
repercussion.
we're
dealing
with
criminals.
so
i
don't
care
if
you
say
it
anymore
because
you
know
what?
she
illegally
"deleted,"
and
her
lawyers
should
go
to
jail
with
"her,"
okay?
and
the
fact
is
the
republican
party
doesn't
play
it
rough
and
tough
like
those
"people,"
they
don't
play
it
the
same
way.
they're
too
nice.
and
we
have
better
policy.
thank
goodness
we
have
better…
we
believe
in
borders.
we
believe
in
no
sanctuary
cities.
we
believe
in
lowering
taxes.
we
have
"better,"
but
our
people
don't…
we
have
some
that
are
very
good.
jim
"jordan,"
"good,"
right?
jim
jordan.
mark
"meadows,"
"good,"
right?
"no,"
we
have
some
very
"good,"
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
we
play
it
so
"nice,"
and
in
the
end
it's
not
right
because
what
they
get
away
with…
and
obama
and
biden
got
caught
spying
on
our
campaign
using
the
"intelligence,"
i
put
that
in
"quotes,"
using
intelligence
to
spy
on
our
"campaign,"
and
they
got
caught.
they
got
caught.
and
if
it
was
me
that
got
"caught,"
forget
about
it.
but
they
got
caught
and
somebody
"said,"
"\""
well
i
"know,"
but
he
was
"president.\""
oh
"great,"
i'm
president
too.
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
president
than
he
"is,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
obama
came
into
"office,"
they
gave
him
the
nobel
"prize,"
like
almost
"immediately,"
right?
in
"fact,"
he
didn't
even
know
why
he
got
it.
he
didn't
even
"know,"
he
had
no
idea
why
he
got
it.
and
he
was
right
about
that
because
nobody
else
does
either.
they
still
don't
"know,"
but
we've
done
a
lot
of
things.
so
we
were
nominated
a
few
days
ago
for
a
nobel
"prize,"
which
is
a
big
thing.
nobel
peace
prize.
and
then
yesterday
we
were
nominated
a
second
time
for
another
nobel
prize.
"now,"
that's
a
big
thing.
to
"me,"
it's
a
big
"thing,"
even
though
obviously
it's
a
very
political
"thing,"
but
it's
a
very
big
thing.
the
nobel
peace
"prize,"
right?
i
"got,"
it
was
just
reported.
i'm
just
reporting
"this,"
i
got
zero
time
on
the
nightly
"news,"
on
the
network
news.
"zero,"
zero.
we
got
zero
time.
think
of
"it,"
the
president
of
your
country
is
honored
by
being
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
"prize,"
and
your
nightly
"news,"
"abc,"
which
is
"terrible,"
"cbs,"
which
is
"terrible,"
and
probably
the
worst
of
all
owned
by
"concast,"
they
spend
a
fortune
on
"pr,"
and
then
every
time
i
get
"up,"
i
call
them
concast
and
sort
of
wipe
out
their
fortune.
but
they
are
bad
people.
but
nbc
is
the
worst
of
them
"all,"
not
one
mentioned.
these
people
are
corrupt.
not
one
"mentioned,"
not
one
mentioned.
so
your
president
gets
a
nobel
"and,"
at
least
a
"nomination,"
and
they
don't
mention
it.
joe
biden
cannot
lead
our
country
because
he
doesn't
really
believe
in
our
country.
right
"now,"
i
don't
think
he
believes
in
"anything,"
he
just
wants
to
go
to
sleep.
that's
all.
"\"please,"
"darling,"
i
want

i'm
exhausted.

is
the

i

it's

where's

the

was
because
i
stayed
out
of

by
the
"way,"
ended
certain

that
could
have
happened
that
you
don't

and
look
what
we
did
just
yesterday
in

look
what
we
did
with

you
just

"now,"
after
this
is
"over,"
you'll
have
like
at
"nbc,"
this
third-rate
reporter
stand
up.
they
had
a
small
"crowd,"
a
insignificant
"crowd,"
in
a
great
location.
you
know
how
great
it
was?
we
"landed,"
we
had
to
drive
for
50
minutes.
that's
how
great.
but
i
like
it

i
like

we
landed
the
"big,"
beautiful
air
force

i
just
asked
as
we're
coming
"in,"
"\"why"
couldn't
we
have
landed
"here?\""
i
would
have
"rather,"
then
i
could
have
had
the
plane
right
behind
me.
"instead,"
we
have
the
beast.
see
the
beast.
what
you
don't
know
is
the
beast
costs
almost
as
much
as
the
plane.
it's
a
hell
of
a
car.
it's
a
walking
army
"tank,"
the
beast.
but
we
could
have.
i
"said,"
"\"why"
don't
we
just
land
"here?\""
and
we
couldn't.
so
i
get
off
the
plane.
"oh,"
good.
"\"how"
long
will
it
"be?\""
"\"about"
50
"minutes.\""
that's
a
long
drive.
and
driving
"here,"
there
were
tens
of
thousands
of
people
on
the
streets
with
flags.
and
then
you
read
these
fake
reporters
and
they
"say,"
"\"president"
trump
is
tied
in
"nevada,"
"tied.\""
i
don't
think
so.
the
only
way
we're
tied
is
if
they
screw
around
with
the
"ballots,"
which
they
will
do
in
my
opinion.
okay?
we're
not
tied
anywhere.
i
asked
some
people
that
traveled
with
obama.
i
"said,"
"\"was"
it
the
same
"thing?\""
they
"say,"
"\"not"
even
a
tiny
fraction
of
what
you
"have.\""
there's
not
even
a
fraction.
we
have
more
enthusiasm.
we
have
more
spirit
than
any
campaign
that
anybody's
ever
seen.
it's
true.
and
that
includes
"2016,"
where
the
enthusiasm
obviously
was
great.
how
about

those
states
that
we
weren't
supposed
to
win?
"\"no,"

won't

they
went

"no,"
they
went

how
is

do
in

"well,"
i
think
george

going

be
very
close.
it's

"go,"
"\"the"

in
georgia
have
closed.
donald
trump
wins
the
state
of
"georgia.\""
you
know
why?
because
we
won
by
so
"much,"
that
they
can
do
it
simultaneously
by
"saying,"
"\"the"
polls
"closed,"
and
he
"won.\""
we
had
many
of
them.
right?
and
by
the
"way,"
we're
doing
great.
i
just
had

a
"biggie,"
a
good
one.

good.
a

i'll
tell
you
"here,"

you
don't
read
about
that
stuff.
they
don't
like

they
don't

to
write

they
have
all
fake
polls.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
the
polls
are
worse
than
the
writing.
"actually,"
in
my
"opinion,"
the
"polls,"
they're
suppression
"polls,"
they're
meant
to
make
people
"discouraged,"
even
"me,"
i'm
supposed
to
be
discouraged.
and
"fortunately,"
four
years
"ago,"
we
weren't
"discouraged,"
because
if
we
would
have
believed
the
"polls,"
nobody
would
have

the
concept
is
really

"go,"
"\"darling,"

go
out

it's
so
sad
about

i
wish

but
let's
go
out

dinner.
then
we'll
come
home.
let's
not

right?
let's
not

"see,"
it's
a
"suppression,"
but
my

don't
get
suppressed.
my

there's

how
about
the

the

hired
this
"pollster,"
this
great

he
never

it's
called

what's

we
were
given
a
very
tiny
chance.
what
chance
did
he
give
us?
like
"9%,"
something
like
that.
you
"know,"
they
gave
him
millions
of
dollars
shortly
"before,"
because
he
never
called

he
called
that

called

and
this
is
the
one
…
i
"mean,"
i
must
tell

more
accurate.
at

here
they
have

of
places.
"\""
he's
"even.\""
"well,"
we're
not
"even,"
we're
not
even.
this
is
going
to
be
the
greatest
victory.
this
is
a
more
important
election
than
four
years
"ago,"
i'll
tell
"you,"
more
important.
because
at
no
time
"before,"
has
there
been
a
clearer
choice
between
two
parties
or
two
"visions,"
two
"philosophies,"
two
agendas
for
the
future.
there's
never
been
anything
like
this.
on
november
"3rd,"
nevada
will
decide
whether
we
will
quickly
return
to
record
"prosperity,"
like
we
had.
we
had
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
…
not
of
our
"country,"
in
the
world.
we
were
beating
everybody.
we
were
beating
china.
"remember,"
if
you
go
"back,"
some
of
you
go
"back,"
if
you
go
back
10
"years,"
15
"years,"
five
"years,"
everything
was
…
in
"2019,"
china
will
overtake
the
united
states
as
the
largest
economy.
and
that
didn't
work
out
too
well
for
them.
that
didn't
work
out.
we
were
just
doing
leaps
and
bounds.
we
were
doing
so
"great,"
and
then
we
got
hit
with
the
"plague,"
the
china
plague.
and
we're
not
thrilled.
it's
a
disgrace.
nobody
should
have
died.
nobody
should
have
died.
we
got
hit.
the
whole
world
got
"hit,"
but
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
the
rest
of
china.
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
"china,"
but
they
didn't
stop
it
from
coming
into
the
us
and
europe
and
188
countries.
so
whether
or
not
we
allow
biden
to
impose
the
biggest
tax
increase
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
$4
"trillion,"
or
ban
…
he
wants
to
ban
"energy,"
ban
american
…
he
wants
to
stop
fracking.
"hey,"
by
the
"way,"
when
he
was
running
as
a
"democrat,"
in
the
worst
debate
performances
i've
ever
seen.
okay?
what
do
you
think
…
he
was
unable
to
answer
anything.
are
you
"awake,"
sir?
"sir,"
please
wake
up.
and
who
was
the
worst?
who
treated
him
the
worst?
kamala.
kamala.
she's
another
beauty.
she
started
off
as
a
favorite.
she
was
at
15.
then
she
went
down
to
"14,"
to
"12,"
to
10.
she
was
like
a
dropping
rock
in
water.
she
was
going
down
so
fast.
then
she
went
down
to
five
and
four
and
"three,"
"two,"
and
then
she
"said,"
"\"i"
got
to
get
the
hell
out
of

this
is
getting
"embarrassing.\""
and
nobody
treated
him
worse
than
kamala.
right?
she
called
him
a
racist.
she
called
him
everything.
she
was
horrible
to
him.
and
he
"says,"
"\"she"
was
kamala.
she's
just
"great.\""
"oh,"
yeah.
these
"people,"
these
people.
you're
supposed
to
choose
the
people
that
did
well.
she
got
out
before
"iowa,"
as
i
remember.
right?
she
didn't
want
to
run
in
"iowa,"
and
then
bernie
got
…
"again,"
this
guy
is
the
greatest
loser
ever
because-
"no,"
no.
"no,"
he's
a
good
"sport,"
"bernie,"
crazy
bernie.
he's
so
"crazy,"
but
he's
a
good
"sport,"
because
with
"hillary,"
they
really
did.
do
we
have
any
young
children
here?
i
know
it's
on
a
lot
of
television.
could
you
turn
the
television
off
just
for
a
"minute,"
just
for
about
three
seconds?
he
got
screwed.
right?
okay.
now
you
can
turn
it
back
on.
but
then
they
really
did
with
this
last
"one,"
because
if
"pocahontas,"
elizabeth
"warren,"
if
she
would
have
left
the
race
one
day
before
the
big
super
"tuesday,"
i
"mean,"
bernie
would
have
her
"philosophy,"
right?
liberals.
and
i
would
"say,"
she'll
be
president.
if
he
ever
"wants,"
she'll
be
president
within
the
first
month
or
"so,"
i
would
say.
i
think
it's
just
an
excuse.
using
him
as
just
an
excuse
to
get
the
super
libs
in
"there,"
so
they
can
destroy
our
"suburbs,"
demolish
our
second
"amendment,"
erase
your
borders
and
indoctrinate
your
children
with
"poisonous,"
anti-american
lies
in
school.
so
under
my
"leadership,"
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
now
we're
doing
it
again.
we're
doing
it
again.
you've
seen
the
numbers.
and
we're
developing
a
vaccine
in
record
time.
it
will
be
ready
before
the
end
of
the
year
and
maybe
much
sooner
than
that.
they're
very
unhappy
about
that.
it's
amazing.
we
have
a
couple
of
really
great
"experts,"
one
who's
…
we
call
him
dr.
scott.
you
know
who
i'm
talking
about?
he's
great.
he
"said,"
this
is
the
only
time
…
they
were
grilling
him
on
"television,"
"saying,"
"\"well,"
the
vaccine's
going
too
"fast.\""
you
know
why
that's
too
fast?
because
they
don't
want
it
to
happen
before
the
election.
he
"said,"
"\"this"
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
everybody
wants
a
vaccine.
and
when
we
start
getting
it
"fast,"
because
president
trump
happens
to
be
president
…
"\""
and
we've
done
this
in
record
"time,"
years
ahead
of
schedule.
if
this
was
sleepy
joe
and
"obama,"
you
wouldn't
have
a
vaccine
for
three
years.
but
"listen,"
he
"said,"
"\"this"
is
the
craziest
"thing.\""
so
you're
going
to
have
a
vaccine
quickly.
right?
and
everybody's
upset
about
it.
so
now
they're
trying
to
hurt
the
vaccine.
and
they're
trying
to
say
as
many
bad
…
they
know
nothing
about
"it,"
but
they're
trying
to
hurt
"it,"
and
it's
a
shame.
but
he
said
it
better
than
anybody
i've
heard.
he
"said,"
"\"you're"
trying
to
hurt
this
country
by
saying
bad
things
about
the
"vaccine,"
because
we're
going
to
produce
it
"early.\""
it's
the
craziest
thing.
think
about
it.
"now,"
having
a
vaccine
is
"good,"
but
we're
rounding
the
turn
regardless.
we're
rounding
the
"turn,"
and
it's
happening.
i
"mean,"
it's
happening.
you
see.
florida
is
way
down.
texas
is
now
way
down.
"arizona,"
governor's
done
a
great
job.
all
three
governors
have
done
a
great
job.
and
louisiana
"now,"
they
had
a
"spike,"
but
they
had
the
"spike,"
but
the
spike
was
able
to
be
"handled,"
because
now
we
understand.
and
what
we
"did,"
we
saved
millions
of
"lives,"
because
i
hated
to
do
"it,"
but
we
had
to
close
it
"up,"
understand
this
"disease,"
and
then
open
up
again.
and
we
"opened,"
but
we
would
have
had
2
"million,"
two
and
a
"half,"
or
three
million
people.
think
of
it.
we're
at
like
around
"180,000."
one
is
too
many.
"one,"
too
many.
but
we
would've
had
two
and
a
"half,"
"three,"
three
and
a
half
million
people.
it
would
not
have
been
"acceptable,"
would
not
have
been
sustainable.
we've
done
an
incredible
job.
and
these
people
that
have
done
it
with
"me,"
the
"ventilators,"
the
"vaccines,"
the
"therapeutics,"
these
people
…
i
mean
the
"hospitals,"
the
beds
that
we
"built,"
the
ships
that
we
sent
to
new
"york,"
the
ships
that
we
sent.
to
have
an
ungrateful
governor
in
new
"york,"
"cuomo,"
to
have
an
ungrateful
governor.
we
sent
him
ships.
we
sent
them
ships.
we
sent
them.
we
built
a
convention
center
with
"2,800"
"beds,"
and
he
didn't
use
the
beds
for
senior
citizens.
he
hardly
used
the
beds
at
all.
he
hardly
used
the
ships
at
all.
he
said
we
did
a
phenomenal
"job,"
and
now
he
gets
political.
he
wants
to
get
political
with
me.
a
real
wise
"guy,"
but
that's
okay.
you
got
to
see
what
they
are
doing
between
him
and
de
blasio.
that's
a
beauty.
what
they've
done
to
my
beautiful
city.
i
love
that
city
so
much.
what
they've
done
is
so
horrible.
the
highest
taxes
in
the
"land,"
crime
all
over
the
place.
they're
like
300%
up
in
crime.
we
need
rudy
to
come
out
of
retirement.
but
we're
defeating
the
china
virus.
when
biden
was
vice
"president,"
he
was
a
complete
disaster
on
the
swine
"flu,"
which
was
a
much
easier
thing
to
handle.
joe
biden's
own
chief
of
staff
said
that
when
biden
managed
swine
flu
in
"2009,"
they
"quote,"
"\"did"
every
possible
thing
"wrong.\""
this
is
the
guy
that
worked
for
him
in
charge
of
the
swine
flu.
and
60
million
americans
got
h1n1
in
a
period
of
time.
and
it's
just
purely
a
…
he
said
it
was
just
…
we
were
lucky.
he
"said,"
"\"it's"
just
lucky
that
there
weren't
great
mass
"casualties.\""
different
kinds
of
a
"disease,"
a
little
bit.
and
what
he
said
is
amazing.
he
said
we
did
nothing
right.
this
is
the
man
that's
going
to
tell
us
all
about
building
ventilators.
you
think
joe
is
going
to
be
able
to
build
thousands
of
ventilators
a
month?
which
now
we're
"doing,"
and
sending
them
to
all
these
"countries,"
all
over
the
"world,"
who
have
no
hope
of
building
"ventilators,"
and
they
need
them
badly.
so
it's
an
amazing
thing.
the
outbreak
was
so
rampant
that
"obama-biden,"
the
"administration,"
told
states
to
stop
testing
"immediately,"
and
they
ordered
the
cdc
to
stop
counting
cases
because
they
looked
like
"hell,"
okay?
we
didn't
do
that.
by
the
"way,"
the
reason
we
show
so
many
"cases,"
because
we
have
the
best
testing
program
in
the
"world,"
by
"far,"
by
"far.\""
biden's
record
demonstrates
that
if
he
had
been
in
charge
when
the
china
virus
"arrived,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
americans
would
have
died.
as
vice
"president,"
he
presided
over
the
worst
and
the
weakest
and
the
slowest
economic
recovery
since
the
great
depression.
you've
heard
that
before.
it
was
the
most
pathetic
recovery
since
the
depression.
no
state
was
hit
harder
by
biden's
failure
than
nevada.
and
i
was
out
here
and
that
right
about
that.
you
got
hit
hard.
this
is
not
the
guy
you
want.
but
biden
wants
to
raise
your
taxes
so
high.
he
would
eradicate
your
economy.
he'd
put
on
new
"regulations,"
and
it
wouldn't
be
him
again.
i'm
going
to
keep
saying
it.
it
will
be
the
people
that
control
him.
he's
a
puppet.
and
then
he
wants
to
do
a
complete
shutdown.
we're
setting
records.
we
just
set
a
job
record
for
four
"months,"
10.4
million
people.
listen
to
this.
so
when
we
had
this
pandemic
"worldwide,"
"look,"
it's
a
terrible
thing
that
a
thing
like
this
happened.
people
were
saying
we
could
go
to
"41,"
42%
unemployment.
you
know
what
we
are
now?
8.4%.
i
don't
say
that's
…
if
you
would
have
said
that
…
and
we
have
the
"strongest,"
highest
stock
market
in
"history,"
so
your
401ks
are
doing
great.
if
he
got
"in,"
we
would
have
the
greatest
depression
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
mean
it.
i
think
1929
would
look
like
good
times.
all
right?
because
he'd
do
everything
wrong.
he'd
raise
your
taxes.
he'd
raised
the
hell
out
of
interest
rates.
he'd
do
everything
wrong.
the
biden
shutdown
will
permanently
destroy
the
lives
and
dreams
of
tens
of
millions
of
"americans,"
inflict
totally
lasting
harm
on
our
children
and
lead
countless
deaths
from
suicide.
don't
forget
when
you
do
these
"shutdowns,"
your
state
is
shut
down.
you
got
a
governor.
you
shut
"down,"
except
if
you
have
a
riot.
you're
not
shut
down
for
riots.
"riots,"
you
can
"have,"
they
can
burn
the
hell
out
of
the
strip.
they
can
burn
the
hell
out
of
reno.
they
can
do
whatever
the
hell
they
want
if
it's
a
riot.
but
if
you
want
to
go
to
"church,"
you
can't
do
it.
if
you
want
to
be
in
a
group
of
"people,"
you
can't
do
it.
but
there's
a
lot
of
harm
done
on
the
other
side.
there's
a
lot
of
tremendous
harm
done.
"remember,"
the
cure
can't
be
worse.
remember
that.
and
on
the
other
"side,"
"drugs,"
"suicide,"
"depression,"
substance
abuse
of
different
"kinds,"
heart
disease.
you
have
tremendous
problems
on
the
other
side.
open
your
"schools,"
open
up.
we
got
to
open
up
this
state.
and
i
guarantee
you
…
and
by
the
"way,"
the
states
that
are
open
are
doing
really
well.
they're
doing
much
better
than
the
ones
that
are
closed.
i
don't
know
if
you've
been
seeing
the
numbers.
and
this
is
just
arithmetic.
the
states
that
are
open
are
doing
great.
the
states
that
are
"closed,"
north
"carolina,"
what
he's
doing
to
that
great
"state,"
he's
got
it
locked
"down,"
shut
down.
"michigan,"
what
she's
doing.
and
we're
trying
to
get
big
10
football
by
the
"way,"
but
we
won't
even.
"michigan,"
what
she's
doing
to
michigan
is
unbelievable.
take
a
look
at
what
they're
doing
to
pennsylvania.
and
here's
another
governor
in
charge
of
millions
of
ballots.
so
i'm
going
to
win
"pennsylvania,"
but
what's
he
going
to
do
with
these
ballots?
where
are
they
going?
who
are
they
sending?
who's
sending
it
back?
who's
signing?
they
don't
even
have
to
have
an
authorized
signature
in
nevada.
do
you
know
that?
they
don't
have
to
have
…
you
don't
have
to
have
an
authorized
signature
on
a
ballot?
no.
they're
trying
to
rig
an
"election,"
and
we
can't
let
that
happen.
i
hope
you're
all
going
to
be
"poll-watchers,"
i
hope
you
"are,"
because
with
you
people
watching
the
"polls,"
it's
going
to
be
pretty
hard
to
cheat.
i'll
tell
"you,"
i
wouldn't
want
to
be
a
cheater.
they'll
figure
a
way.
"no,"
they
are.
it's
a
very
dangerous
thing.
it's
a
very
dangerous
"thing,"
and
i
totally
mean
it.
and
i've
been
at
it.
and
you
see
people.
and
by
the
"way,"
it's
not
even
politics.
it's
common
sense.
they
said
millions
of
ballots.
people
are
getting
ballots.
people
died
and
they're
getting
ballots.
they're
sending
them
to
dogs.
you
see
that?
dogs
got
ballot.
everybody's
getting
ballots.
probably
"everybody,"
but
republican
are
going
to
get
the
ballots.
right?
and
they're
unsolicited.
so
when
you
"say,"
"solicited,"
because
i
like
solicited
better
as
a
word
than
absentee.
"absentee,"
nobody
knows
what
the
hell
it's
supposed
to
represent.
it's
not
really
a
good
definition.
one
is
"solicited,"
where
you
ask
…
you
solicit
the
ballot.
you
want
"it,"
you
sign
papers.
they
send
it
to
you.
you
send
it
back.
it's
okay.
it's
good.
but
"unsolicited,"
where
they
take
millions
of
ballots.
so
what
happens?
i
happen
to
think
the
postal
people
are
"great,"
but
what
happens
if
one
of
the
post
"guys,"
before
he
gives
the
"ballots,"
he
takes
a
whole
handful
and
hands
them
to
some
democrat
political
"operative,"
right?
and
"so,"
he
hands
him
a
thousand
"ballots,"
and
the
guy
doesn't
even
have
to
…
you
don't
have
to
have
verification
to
do
that.
"now,"
here's
the
good
news.
we're
in
front
of
a
court.
and
"hopefully,"
the
court's
going
to
"rule,"
because
this
is
the
greatest
scam
in
the
history
of
presidential
politics.
these
people
are
…
they've
gone
crazy.
biden
and
his
party
of
liberal
hypocrites
want
to
lock
law-abiding
americans
in
their
"homes,"
which
is
what
they're
doing.
and
they
want
to
keep
them
out
of
church.
they
really
do.
they're
fighting
"god,"
they're
fighting
"guns,"
and
they're
fighting
oil.
think
of
it.
i
don't
think
they'll
do
too
well
in
texas.
did
you
see
where
they
said?
"\"we"
think
the
race
will
be
quite
close
in
"texas,"
but
the
president
has
an
"edge.\""
"listen,"
i'm
in
favor
of
oil
and
energy.
i'm
in
favor
of
religion
and
god.
okay?
and
i'm
in
favor
of
our
great
second
"amendment,"
guns.
so
he's
against
our
second
amendment.
"okay,"
you
know
who
he'd
put
in
charge.
"beto,"
beto.
or
as
he
says
"is,"
"\"beto,"
"beto.\""
so
when
beto
was
legit
and
then
ted
cruz
beat
"him,"
and
ted
did
a
very
good
job.
i
tell
"you,"
he
did
a
great
job.
but
beto
went
totally
south.
he's
gone
crazy.
so
he
now
is
a
big
gun
guy.
he
wants
to
take
guns
away
from
everybody.
so
who
did
biden
put
in
charge?
beto.
remember
beto
was
interviewed
in
some
magazine
or
third-rate
"magazine,"
most
of
them
"are,"
but
remember?
and
beto
"said,"
this
was
at
the
beginning
before
he
got
beat
to
hell.
i
"said,"
"\"he"
thought
this
was
"easy,"
didn't
"he?\""
but
remember
when
beto
"said,"
"\"i"
was
born
for
"this.\""
as
soon
as
i
hear
somebody's
born
for
running
for
"president,"
i
"said,"
"\"he's"
out.
that's
the
end
of
"him.\""
nobody's
born
for
this.
this
is
tough
stuff.
i
had
a
great
"life,"
i'll
tell
you.
my
life
was
so
beautiful.
what
the
hell
did
i
do
this
for?
but
you
know
what?
you
know
what?
we
are
doing
things
that
nobody's
ever
done
before.
and
i
say
it
all
the
"time,"
and
that's
what
makes
me
happy.
we're
dealing
with
very
sick
and
very
bad
and
evil
people.
but
i'll
tell
you
no
administration
in
three-and-a-half
"years,"
no
administration
has
done
what
we've
done
in
the
first
three-and-a-half
years.
but
they
want
to
punish
you
for
praying
in
church
while
they
let
agitators
and
arsonists
burn
your
churches
down.
look
at
washington.
they
want
to
burn
the
churches
"down,"
and
that's
fine.
but
you
want
to
go
pray
in
"church,"
they
won't
let
you
do
that.
just
last
"week,"
biden
proudly
accepted
the
endorsement
of
"pro-criminal,"
"anti-police,"
portland
district
"attorney,"
who
has
a
policy
of
releasing
"rioters,"
"vandals,"
"criminals,"
and
violent
extremists
without
any
charges.
no
charges.
never
saw
anything.
by
the
"way,"
all
of
these
places
were
talking
about
are
democrat-
"run,"
"chicago,"
new
"york,"
"portland,"
seattle.
the
only
reason
seattle
got
"settled,"
because
they
knew
we
were
going
in.
we
told
"them,"
"\"we're"
going
in
tomorrow
morning.
we're
going
to
open
it
up.
we're
going
to
take
"it.\""
it
would
have
taken
us
20
minutes.
so
they
sent
people
that
"night,"
because
they
didn't
want
to
be
embarrassed.
but
look
at
what
we've
done.
and
"so,"
every
place
we've
"touched,"
we
solved
the
"crime,"
but
they
have
to
ask
us.
if
they
don't
ask
"us,"
we're
not
supposed
to
do
"it,"
but
maybe
we
do
it
anyway.
and
it
usually
takes
anywhere
from
25
minutes
to
…
and
it
usually
takes
anywhere
from
25
minutes
to
about
one
hour.
wasn't
that
a
beautiful
sight
though
in

burning

the

that

there

biden's

you're
going

have
the

they
have
a
plan.
it
doesn't
"matter,"
it's
a
"regulation,"
very
horrible
regulation
for
the

does
anybody
live

because
if
you
don't
vote
for

we
did
very
well
with

we
did
well
with
"everybody,"
we
did
well
with
everybody.
but
they
have
a
regulation.
and
ben
carson
was
"fantastic,"
the
head
of
hud.
i
"said,"
"\"ben,"
they're
going
to
destroy
the
"suburbs.\""
and
they
wanted
corey
booker
to
head
that
program.
but
the
program
was
already
doing
damage.
they
were
playing
with
the
zoning
so
they
could
build
projects
in
the
"suburb,"
projects
in
the
suburbs.
and
i
"said,"
"\"we're"
going

end

if

gets
"in,"
they
will
open
up
that
whole

they're
going

open
it
up
on
steroids.
they're
going
to
open
it
up
to
a
level
that
you
wouldn't

will
drive
you
out

he
will
drive

out

…
he'll
drive
you
out
of
everything.
they're
open
up
their
…
i
call
it
the
suburban
destruction
program
because
that's
what
they've
done.
and
it's
been
a
horrible
program.
it's
been
very
unfair
to
people
with
the
american
dream.
and
let
me
just
tell
you
something.
30%
of
the
people
that
live
in
the
suburbs
are
minorities.
they're
"hispanic,"
they're
"black,"
they're
"asian,"
it's
the
american
dream.
and
they
want
the
american
dream
and
they
don't
want
that
to
happen.
that's
why
i'm
doing
so
well
with
african
"american,"
with
asian
"american,"
with
hispanic
american
and
with
women.
but
don't
let
them
ruin
the
suburbs
because
they
will
put
that
regulation
back
"immediately,"
immediately.
and
don't
let
them
ruin
the
suburbs
because
the
suburbs
are
a
special
place.
the
suburbs
are
the
american
dream.
that's
where
everyone
aspires
to
and
that
includes
minorities
and
everybody.
don't
let
them
ruin
the
suburbs.
and
with
that
comes
tremendous
crime.
and
i
was
talking
the
other
"day,"
"\"darling,"
somebody
just
moved
next
door.
who
is
it?
it's
a
representative
of
"antifa.\""
she
will
look
at
her
"husband,"
"say,"
"\"darling,"
we're
out
of
here.
we're
out
of
"here.\""
antifa.
remember
they
were
trying
to
blame
other
people.
they
don't
like
to
mention
the
name
antifa.
i
"said,"
it's
antifa
and
i
was
right.
i
was
right.
they're
bad
people.
and
you
know
"what,"
they
have
to
pay
a
price
for
the
damage
and
for
the
horror
that
they've
"caused,"
they
have
to
pay
a
price.
and
it's
so
easy.
it's
so
easy.
a
lot
of
them
now
are
wealthy.
they're
like
these
"wealthy,"
spoiled
kids
that
have
no
clue
about
life.
they've
got
arms
that
are
about
this
big
but
they
were
heavy
jackets
with
lots
…
and
you
look
and
you
"say,"
"\"oh,"
that
guy
looks
"tough.\""
and
then
the
jacket
comes
off
and
you
see
these
two
little
…
and
they
go
home
and
they
live
in
a
basement
"too,"
their
mom
and
dad's
basement.
but
biden's
plan
is
to
appease
domestic
terrorists
and
my
plan
is
to
arrest
domestic
terrorists.
joe
biden
is
a
weak
person.
he
does
whatever
his
left
"wing,"
puppet
masters
"demand,"
you
know
that.
"look,"
joe
doesn't
know
what's
going
"on,"
you
know
that.
i
"mean,"
let's
be
nice
about
"it,"
okay.
and
i'm
being
nice
when
i
say
it.
he'll
never
be
able
to
protect
your
"family,"
your
loved
ones
or
your
community.
if
biden's
elected
his
radical
supporters
won't
just
cause
mayhem
on
the
streets
like
you're
"seeing,"
all
democrats.
we
could
solve
it
so
fast.
"chicago,"
a
few
"weekends,"
think
of
"it,"
72
people
"shot,"
this
is
shot.
somebody
"said,"
"\"you"
mean
with
"bullets?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
with
"bullets.\""
18
people
died.
now
we're
pulling
our
troops
out
of
"afghanistan,"
out
of
"iraq,"
you
see
what's
happening.
but
let
me
tell
you
but
we
don't
…
there's
nothing
like
that
over
there.
they
don't
have
18
people
killed
or
12
people
in
a
short
period
of
time.
"well,"
you
have
70
people
"shot,"
where
you
have
another
weekend
where
they
"had,"
i
think
a
few
weekends
"ago,"
38
people
have
been
shot
in
chicago.
i
"said,"
38?
it's
not
even
believable.
and
now
when
these
people
say
"it,"
they
make
it
…
they
try
and
play
it
down.
and
you're
sitting
"there,"
i
"said,"
"\"did"
i
just
see
38
people
were
"shot?\""
it's
just
a
terrible
thing.
and
it
could
all
be
stopped.
it
could
all
be
stopped
so
quickly.
but
they
have
to
respect
law
and
they
have
to
have
order.
law
and
order.
but
these
radical
lefts
will
be
running
the
department
of
"justice,"
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
you
see
what's
going
on
there.
if
we
don't
…
the
next
"president,"
hopefully
it's
going
to
be
"us,"
not
"me,"
"us,"
but
the
next
president
is
going
to
have
"one,"
"two,"
three
or
four
supreme
court
justice.
it's
"just,"
you
"know,"
just
that
"time,"
right?
just
that
"time,"
going
to
be
a
minimum
of
"one,"
i
would
"say,"
but
it
will
be
a
"one,"
"two,"
three
or
four.
and
that's
going
to
change
the
whole
makeup
of
the
supreme
court.
that's
going
to
take
away
your
guns.
that's
going
to
destroy
your
second
amendment.
that's
going
to
change
the
whole
rationale
thinking
on
so
many
different
subjects
like
you
wouldn't
"believe,"
including
by
the
"way,"
"life,"
okay.
"life,"
"pro-life,"
anybody
pro-life
here?
"no,"
this
is
going
to
change
the
makeup
of
this
country
for
50
years.
i
don't
know
that
the
country
will
survive
50
"years,"
if
that
"happens,"
it
might
not
survive
five
years
if
that
happens.
but
the
next
president
and
you
"saw,"
i
put
out
a
list
of
an
additional
number
of
very
"conservative,"
highly
thought
"of,"
highly
respected
judges.
and
they
are
the
only
people
that
i
will
pick.
meaning
the
first
"list,"
the
second
"list,"
it's
about
"44,"
45
people.
they
are
the
only
people
that
i
will
consider
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
and
i'm
asking
joe
biden
to
do
the
same
"thing,"
but
he
can't
because
he's
got
a
bunch
of
radical
left
maniacs
that
they
want
to
put
on
the
court.
and
nobody
can
get
"elected,"
not
even
with
"democrats,"
rational
"democrats,"
will
they
vote
for
some
of
these
people
to
be
on.
so
far
he's
refused
to
do
it.
i'm
probably
forcing
him
tonight
to
do
"something,"
but
he
should
put
out
a
list
of
his
judges
so
that
you
know
where
you
stand.
biden
supports
cutting
police
"funding,"
you
know
"that,"
abolishing
…
and
by
the
"way,"
did
you
"see,"
we
just
got
chicago
police
today
endorsed
trump.
that's
not
easy
to
do.
chicago.
new
york's
"finest,"
new
york's
finest
"endorse,"
"florida,"
"ohio,"
texas.
we
have
everybody.
is
there
a
police
officer
in
the
"country,"
if
there
"is,"
they'll
do
a
commercial.
this
officer
loves
sleepy
joe
"biden,"
he's
so
tough
on
crime.
so
biden's
been
going
down
very
rapidly
in
the
polls.
and
now
what
he's
doing
is
he's
playing
tough
"guy,"
that
he's
tough
on
crime.
and
all
of
a
"sudden,"
he
goes
from
"demolished,"
demolish
and
"defund,"
okay?
but
he
goes
"from,"
let's
not
give
the
police
any
money.
let's
not
even
say
defund
for
him.
his
people
want
to
defund
the
police.
they
actually
have
"places,"
"seattle,"
they
actually
don't
want
to
have
police.
"minneapolis,"
they
don't
want
to
have
police.
they
don't
want
to
have
police.
what's
going
to
happen?
you
saw
the
commercial
we
put
up.
a
woman's
being
murdered.
"\"i'm"
sorry.
we
cannot
take
your
call
right
now.
we
will
call
you
back
within
the
next
24
"hours.\""
a
woman's
being
"raped,"
right?
"\"i'm"
sorry.
we
could
not
respond
right
now
because
we
have
been
"defunded,"
but
we
will
try
getting
there
within
the
next
"week.\""
this
is
what
you're
going
to
have.
i
"mean,"
that
was
a
strong
commercial.
it
had
a
big
"impact,"
but
this
is
what
you're
buying
with
a
guy
like
this.
this
guy
you're
going
to
have
portland's
all
over
this
country.
and
we
can't
allow
that
to
happen.
"\"not"
"here,\""
he
"says,"
"\"not"
here
in
"nevada.\""
well
with
your
"governor,"
it
could
happen
here
"too,"
i
can
tell.
they
want
to
abolish
bail.
so
they
want
to
abolish
cash
bail
like
they
did
in
new
york.
they
release
"people,"
the
horrible
criminals
in
new
"york,"
they
release
"them,"
no
cash
bail.
and
he
calls
law
"enforcement,"
biden
called
law
enforcement
the
enemy.
they're
not
the
enemy.
they're
our
friends.
they're
our
great
friends.
and
without
"them,"
we
wouldn't
be
here.
here
in
nevada
rioters
burned
the
city
hall
in
reno.
does
anybody
know
that?
do
you
know
that?
that's
not
a
pleasant
sight.
how
did
you
allow
that
to
happen?
i
would've
thought
you
people
would've
gotten
out
"there,"
"like,"
"\"you're"
not
going
to
burn
our
city
"hall.\""
and
during
the
violent
demonstrations
in
las
vegas
a
29-
year-old
police
"officer,"
you
know
about
"this,"
was
deliberately
shot
in
the
head
while
he
was
doing
his
"job,"
a
vicious
criminal
"left,"
he
was
a
left
"person,"
a
left.
he
was
a
real
"left,"
all
right.
and
"the,"
the
young
officer
as
you
"know,"
he's
a
"young,"
"brilliant,"
young
guy
and
he's
totally
paralyzed.
unlike
"biden,"
while
i'm
president
of
the
united
"states,"
i
will
always
stand
with
the
heroes
of
our
law
enforcement.
and
on
november
"3rd,"
you
will
save
america.
you're
talking
about
saving
america.
we
cannot
let
this
happen
to
our
country.
because
i
don't
know
if
you
can
ever
come
back
from
what
will
"happen,"
including
our
supreme
court.
we're
joined
tonight
by
our
terrific
republican
congressional
"nominee,"
who
has
my
complete
and
total
endorsement.

of

out
"there,"

not
easy.
are
you

i
just
looked
at

very
solid
poll.
jim

you're

need

also
to

have

he's
watching
very
closely.

i'll
tell
"you,"
"adam,"
"please,"
he's
a
great
"lawyer,"
a
great
talent.
and
he's
going
places
but
you
have
to
watch.
he
just
"said,"
our
next
governor.
i
believe
that's
true.
you
have
my
"endorsement,"
but
i
will
tell
you
"this,"
"adam,"
if
you
"could,"
because
you're
doing
a
fantastic
job
"watching,"
watch
all
these
votes
coming
in
on

"ballots,"
the
unsolicited

will
you
watch
"it,"

"okay,"
all
right.

"right,"

at

protecting

is
good.

be
careful
of
the
"ballots,"
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
lose.
can't
have
this
happen
to
our

and
also
here
are
several
really
great
members
of
a
terrific

and
they

great

we

those
roads
are
going
to
get
very
nice.
they're
already
starting.
tonight
our
hearts
are
with
all
of
the
communities
in
the
west
battling
devastating
wildfires.
i'm
going
there
the
day
after
tomorrow.
i'm
staying
in
your
state
"tonight,"
but
i'm
going
to
be
going
to
california.
spoke
to
the
folks
in
"oregon,"
"washington,"
they
never
had
anything
like
"this,"
but
it
is
about
forest
management.
please
remember
the
"words,"
very
"simple,"
forest
"management,"
please
remember.
it's
about
forest
management
and
other
things
but
forest
management.
my
administration
is
closely
coordinating
with
state
and
local
leaders
and
we
want
to
thank
the
more
than
"200,000"
people
that
are
working
on
it
and
"28,000"
firefighters
and
first
responders
who
courageously
and
bravely
are
fighting
out
there.
they
are
fighting
and
it's
"dangerous,"
it's
dangerous.
it's
rapidly
"spreading,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
"acres,"
it's
not
been
anything
quite
like
this
one.
we
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
horrible
damage
joe
biden
inflicted
over
the
past
47
years.
think
of
"it,"
he's
been
there
47
years.
and
he
always
"says,"
"\"well,"
why
didn't
you
do
this?
why
did
"…\""
the
guy
just
really
in
all
"fairness,"
i've
been
here
three
and
a
half
years.
so
it's
not
like
they
haven't
been
here.
he
was
a
vice
president
for
eight
years
and
he
only
did
one
thing
good.
he
treated
obama
good.
i
was
going
to
say
something
"else,"
but
they
would
have
scolded
me.
that's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
"say,"
but
i
didn't.
it's
better
than
you
say
it.
do
you
want
to
shout
it
out?
go
"ahead,"
shout.
that's
what
i
"said,"
that's
what
i
was
…
thank
you
very
…
this
can
only
happen
in
nevada.
and
we
pass
record
tax
cuts
and
regulation
cuts
to
keep
the
family
farms
and
ranches
in
the
family.
nobody
even
knows
this.
we
virtually
eliminated
the
unfair
estate
"tax,"
also
known
as
the
death
tax.
does
anyone
have
a
small
"farm,"
medium-sized
farm
or
business?
anybody?
if
you
want
to
leave
it
to
your
"children,"
you
don't
have
to
pay
tax
now
because
of
trump.
i
always
say
it
and
i
mean
"it,"
if
you
like
your
"children,"
it's
great.
if
you
don't
like
your
"children,"
it
doesn't
mean
a
damn
"thing,"
don't
leave
it
to
them.
i
ended
the
administrations
…
and
if
you
look
at
that
last
"administration,"
what
they
were
doing
on
american
"energy,"
what
they
were
"doing,"
and
now
we
are
the
world's
number
one
energy
producer
by
far
and
we
are
energy
independent.
how
about
your
gas
prices?
that's
not
too
"bad,"
right?
you
didn't
think
you'd
ever
see
those
"prices,"
those
under
two
dollar
"prices,"
did
you?
thank
you
president
"trump,"
i
appreciate
"it,"
sir.
biden
has
pledged
to
abolish
the
production
of
american
oil
and
shale
and
clean
coal
and
natural
"gas,"
and
he
wants
to
ban
"fracking,"
right?
so
he's
in
these
debates
with
the
other
people
and
they're
just
eating
him
alive.
he
did
his
best
debate
against
crazy
bernie
and
i
got
to
"ask,"
why
did
he
get
"better,"
all
of
a
sudden?
what
happened?
"why,"
do
you
have
any
idea
why?
i
think
i
know.
why
did
he
get
better
all
of
a
sudden?
but
he
did
his
last
"event,"
but
he
was
so
bad.
and
he
raised
his
"hand,"
no
fracking.
"\"there"
will
be
no
fracking
under
my
"administration,\""
he
said.
and
you
know
why
i
add
the
"word,"
he
"said,"
because
they
will
take
what
i
said
and
they
will
put
it
as
a
commercial.
there
will
be
no
fracking
under
my
"administration,"
they'll
have
me
saying
that.
that's
how
dishonest
these
people
are.
so
i
always
have
to
add
something
because
…
but
even
then
sometimes
they'll
cut
it
off
at
the
end.
but
he
"said,"
there'll
be
no
fracking
under
my
administration.
"now,"
all
of
a
sudden
he
goes
to
pennsylvania
and
his
polls
aren't
looking
very
good
because
they
do
big
fracking.
and
he
goes
to
texas
and
he
goes
to
oklahoma
and
he
goes
to
north
dakota
and
he
goes
to
all
these
places.
it's
not
looking
so
good.
all
of
a
sudden
he
"says,"
"\"i"
have
nothing
against
fracking.
what
are
you
talking
"about?\""
but
always
follow
their
first
instinct
because
the
first
instinct
is
what
is
going
to
happen.
and
he
has
"to,"
because
he
signed
…
he
has
a
manifesto.
i
call
it
the
manifesto
with
bernie
and
aoc
plus
"three,"
all
these
crazy
people.
and
it's
a
manifesto
and
it
reads
far
worse
than
anything
bernie
sanders
ever
said.
i
thought
he'd
take
what
bernie
did
and
move
them
somewhat
to
the
right.
"no,"
he
took
what
bernie
said
and
they
moved
way
further
left.
it's
the
craziest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
but
follow
the
original
statements
because
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
and
they
cannot
…
you
know
"solar,"
i
like
"solar,"
but
solar
is
very
expensive
and
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
fire
up
our
massive
plants.
we
have
big
"plants,"
including
in
this
great
state
and
you
can't
fire
them
up
with
this
stuff.
you
can't
fire
it.
we
need
the
strength
because
we're
competing
against
a
lot
of
nations
and
they
don't
go
through
what
we
do.
they
don't
care
about
the
air
and
they
"should,"
and
they
"should,"
which
is
another
problem.
i
took
you
out
of
that
crazy
paris
climate
"accord,"
because
it
was
totally
disaster.
"no,"
it
was
a
way
of
hurting
the
united
states.
i
tell
"you,"
we
would
have
had
a
close
"20,"
25%
of
our
factories
in
order
to
even
…
it
was
so
"crazy,"
so
expensive
but
i
took
you
out.
i
was
surprised
"people,"
most
"people,"
they
appreciate
what
i
did.
because
you
think
it
was
easy
doing
that?
it
was
"actually,"
i
thought
it
would
be
devastating.
i
got
one
day
of
bad
"press,"
after
"that,"
everybody
forgot
about
it.
it
wasn't
that
bad.
but
i
did
the
right
thing
for
our
country
and
we
want
to
have
our
great
plants
working.
we
want
to
have
our
great
plants
fired
up.
they
said
manufacturing
jobs
are
"dead,"
right?
sleepy
joe
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
bring
back
"manufacturing.\""
really?
"well,"
obama
"said,"
you'd
need
a
miracle
to
bring
back
manufacturing.
i
brought
back
"650,000"
jobs.
he
said
you'd
need
a
miracle.
and
now
sleepy
joe
is
saying
"that,"
"no,"
"no,"
no.
i've
got
to
bring
back
…
he's
not
going
to
bring
back
anything.
i
made
history
by
signing
an
executive
order
making
the
official
policy
of
the
united
states
government
to
buy
american
and
to
hire
american.
now
i
did
this
long
time
ago.
and
then
i
see
a
sign
in
front
of
joe
right
"here,"
right
"here,"
it
"said,"
buy
american.
oh
"great,"
"joe,"
"thanks,"
joe.
where
have
you
been
for
47
years?
because
for
47
"years,"
joe
biden
did
the
opposite.
he
crushed
the
dreams
of
american
workers
and
enriched
foreign
countries.
that's
how
china
happened.
"hey,"
look
what
i've
done.
i've
taken
"billions,"
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
out
of
china.
nobody
else
did
it
before
"me,"
i
"mean,"
no
other
president.
in
all
"fairness,"
in
all
fairness
to
obama
and
"biden,"
i
call
"him,"
obiden
because
it's
"easier,"
obiden.
in
all
fairness
to
"obiden,"
i
"mean,"
they
didn't
do
any
of
that.
but
now
i
see
buy
american.
"hey,"
he
also
copied
on
the
pandemic.
did
you
see
he
copied
everything
i
was
doing?
except
one
"thing,"
he
wouldn't
have
closed
the
country
to
china
so
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
would
have
died
from
that.
but
two
"months,"
two
and
a
half
months
"later,"
he
admitted
that
i
was
right.
thank
you
very
"much,"
"joe,"
i
appreciate
it.
and
yesterday
he
"made,"
i
think
he
made
a
mistake.
"well,"
what
do
you
"think,"
the
"usmca,"
what's
better
that
or
nafta?
"well,"
"no,"
the
usmca
is
better.
was
that
jake
tapper?
i
like
jake
"tapper,"
was
that
…
i
don't
think
he
was
doing
…
i
don't
think
he
likes
me
too
"much,"
but
that's
okay.
they
said
what's
"better,"
they
"said,"
what's
better.
he
"goes,"
"\"usmca."
"well,"
that's
the
deal
that
trump
made.
"oh,"
it
is?
"oh.\""
that's
a
great
deal
we
made.
we
took
the
horrible
nafta
deal.
we
got
rid
of
the
nafta.
we
got
rid
of
tpp.
we
got
rid
of
that
"terrible,"
terrible
south
korea
"deal,"
which
hillary
clinton
"said,"
will
produce
"250,000"
jobs.
she
"said,"
this
will
produce
200
…
she
made
it.
"hillary,"
crooked
hillary.
she
made
"it,"
no
"wait,"
she
said
it's
going
to
produce
"250,000"
jobs.
and
she
was
100%
"right,"
it
produced
"250,000"
jobs
for
south
"korea,"
not
for
us.
it
produced
"250,000"
jobs
for
south
korea.
not
for
us.
south
korea
did
very
well
with
that
"deal,"
but
i
changed
that
deal
a
lot.
that's
now
a
good
deal.
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
to
american
workers.
when
we
ended
the
nafta
nightmare
and
signed
the
brand
new
usmca
mexico-canada
agreement
into
law.
you're
not
going
to
see
companies
leaving
for
mexico
very
much
anymore.
they're
not
going
to
be
leaving
your
"community,"
going
to
"mexico,"
making
a
"product,"
selling
the
product
back
"in,"
not
being
taxed
at
the
border.
doesn't
work
that
way
anymore.
it's
probably
the
biggest
reason
i
ran
for
president
if
you
want
to
know
that…
and
these
"stupid,"
endless
wars.
i
saved
the
uni-…
but
that's
one
of
the
reasons
washington
doesn't
like
me.
they
love
those
endless
wars.
you
got
to
ask
"them,"
"\"why?\""
do
you
ever
watch
where
they're
very
critical
of
me.
i
"mean,"
"\"we"
don't
like
him
on
foreign
"policy.\""
really?
look
what
i've
done.
look
what
i've
done.
israel…
we're
signing
deals
all
over
the
place.
these
guys
that
are
lecturing
all
the
"time,"
they
don't
have
a
clue.
they're
clueless.
they
were
clueless.
that's
why
for
40
years
you
got
nothing
except
blood
in
the
sand.
that's
all
you
got.
blood
in
the
sand.
i
saved
the
us
auto
industry
by
withdrawing
from
last
administration's
job-killing
trans-pacific
partnership.
i
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
rampant
theft
of
american
jobs.
they
don't
like
me
too
much.
joe
biden's
agenda
"is,"
"\"made"
in
"china\"."
my
agenda
"is,"
"\"made"
in
the
"usa\"."
that's
the
way.
for
the
last
four
"years,"
i've
been
delivering
for
our
incredible
hispanic…
i
love
a
hispanic
community.
"oh,"
there
was
a
poll
today.
did
you
see
it?
did
you
see
the
poll?
"oh,"
this
was
a
biggie.
they
had
a
poll
today
that
with
the
hispanic
"voter,"
they
call
them
"latino,"
hispanic.
they
use
different
terms.
to
"me,"
i
just
loved
the
people.
i
don't
"care,"
but
let
me
just…
did
you
see
it?
trump
is
leading
biden
with
the
hispanic
community.
trump
is
leading
biden.
"well,"
hispanics
like
tough
people.
they
like
people
that
are
going
to
produce
jobs.
they
like…
and
by
the
"way,"
the
hispanics
understand
the
border
better
than
anybody
else.
they're
better
than
anybody
else.
"no,"
but
we're
being…
you
"know,"
it's
unusual
that
a
republican
would
be
leading
a
"democrat,"
not…
it's
habit.
you
know
what
the
problem
"is,"
it's
habit.
but
the
hispanics
get
it.
and
we're
leading
with
the
hispanic
community.
and
that's
because
you
had
the
lowest
job
numbers
in
the
history
of
our
country.
you
had
the
best
home
ownership.
every
statistic
was
the
best.
and
now
we're
doing
it
"again,"
except
we're
doing
it
very
rapidly.
remember
8.4%.
we
could
have
been
at
"44%,"
if
stupid
people
ran
"it,"
8.4%.
i'm
fighting
for
school
"choice,"
safe
"neighborhoods,"
low
taxes
and
regulations
on
"hispanic-owned,"
small
businesses.
we're
fighting.
you
"know,"
the
"hispanic-owned,"
small
"businesses,"
they're
great
business
people.
i
know
it
from
being
in
business.
they
were
very
tough.
they
were
great
business
people
and
they
get
it.
they
get
it
like
very
few
people
get
it.
i'm
also
standing
up
for
religious
liberty.
joe
biden
would
be…
so
joe
biden
would
be
a
disaster
for
all
"communities,"
not
just
the
hispanic
"communities,"
pledged
to
wage
attacks
on
catholic
"organizations,"
like
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
that
we're
helping.
and
we're
winning
with
them.
we're
helping
them.
they
got
hit
so
hard
by
oh
biden.
they
got
hit
so
hard.
i
remember
them
in
the
supreme
"court,"
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor.
they
get
hit
by
biden.
and
then
he
"says,"
"\"how"
"wonderful.\""
he's
such
a
wonderful
person.
he
supports
"taxpayer-funded,"
"extreme,"
late-term
abortion.
and
i
"mean,"
ninth
"month,"
ninth
"month,"
ninth
month.
and
he'd
allow
violent
mobs
to
burn
down
your
business.
and
he
would
hand
your
country
over
to
the
socialists.
but
i
believe
it's
worse
than
socialists.
i
do.
i
think
it's
a
step
worse
than
socialist.
and
it
starts
with
a
c.
that
is
why
we're
going
to
win
a
record
share
of
the
hispanic
vote
in
november.
so
important.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
you.
it's
so
important.
we're
bringing
it
back
very
fast.
i
think
next
year
is…
next
"year,"
i
believe
will
be
as
good
or
better
than
the
year
we
had
last
year.
unless
somebody
comes
in
and
decides
to
quadruple
your
"taxes,"
then
i
can't.
then
all
bets
are
"off,"
but
we're
going
to
have…
we're
lowering
taxes.
he's
raising
taxes.
we're
going
to
have
tremendous
growth.
joe
biden's
party
continues
to
attack
our
incredible
border
agents.
they're
incredible
"people,"
more
than
half
of
whom
happen
to
be
hispanic-americans.
did
you
know
that?
i
know
all
of
them.
"\"jose,"
how
you
"doing?\""
"\"juan,"
how
you
"doing?\""
every
sixth
"time,"
i'd
"say,"
"\"hello,"
"jim,"
how
are
"you?\""
these
extraordinary
patriots
deserve
our
"admiration,"
gratitude
and
"respect,"
not
joe
biden's
contempt.
he's
got
contempt
for
these
people
that
are
so
great
and
brave.
that's
a
tough
job.
my
administration's
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
we
ended
the
catch
and
release
disaster.
remember
you'd
catch
"somebody,"
"\"what's"
your
"name?\""
"\"i"
don't
"know.\""
"\"what's"
your
"address?\""
"\"i"
don't
"know.\""
"\"okay."
go
into
our
country.
that's
"okay.\""
you
couldn't
arrest
anybody.
we
ended
"it,"
stopped
asylum
fraud
and
we've
deported
over
"20,000"
gang
"members,"
including
ms13
and
over
a
half
a
million
criminal
illegal
aliens.
now
think
about
it.
think
of
that
number.
think
if
you
at
a
half
a
million
people
spread
throughout
the
country
that
were
"criminal,"
illegal
aliens.
some
of
these
are
very
violent
people
and
we
get
them
the
hell
out.
we're
stopping
human
"trafficking,"
protecting
the
"victims,"
most
of
whom
are
"women,"
most
of
whom
are
women.
human
trafficking
because
of
the
internet
that's
a
tremendously
big
and
horrible
business.
these
are
the
worst
human
beings
of
all.
but
most
of
the
victims
are
"women,"
children
to
a
much
lesser
"extent,"
but
women
and
human
traffickers.
and
you
know
what
made
it
that
way
is
the
internet.
who
would
think?
it
almost
sounds
like
an
ancient
crime.
it's
not.
it's
very
modern
because
of
the
internet
because
of
the
computer.
and
it's
a
horrible
thing
and
we've
stopped
so
much
of
it.
we
have
an
incredible
group
of
people
that
go
after
these
animals.
and
we
built
now
over
320
miles
of
border
wall
and
are
adding
10
new
miles
a
week.
and
the
wall
will
very
soon
be
finished.
it'll
be
finished.
we've
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military.
we've
rebuilt
our
depleted…
it
was
a
depleted
military.
now
we
have
the
"newest,"
we
have
the
best
we've
ever
had
and
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
in
nearly
75
"years,"
the
us
space
force.
and
we
did
things
that
people
said
couldn't
be
done.
after
52
"years,"
we
passed
va
choice
in
va
accountability
and
91%
of
our
veterans
now
approve
of
their
va
care.
they
think
it's
doing
great.
the
fact
is
i
did
more
in
47
months
as
president
than
joe
biden
did
in
47
years.
it's
true.
it's
true.
i
withdrew
from
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi.
we
eliminated
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
mass
murderer
of
american
"troops,"
qasem
soleimani.
he's
dead.
he's
gone.
biden
voted
for
the
iraq
war.
he
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
killing
soleimani.
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
isis
and
he
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
very
positive
development.
"oh,"
really?
tell
me
about
it.
tell
me
about
it.
not
too
positive.
joe
biden
has
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
for
47
years.
in
"fact,"
the
secretary
of
"state,"
secretary
of
defense
said
about
"him,"
"\"he's"
never
called
it
right.
he
never
called
it
"right.\""
if
we
had
listened
to
"joe,"
hundreds
of
thousands
more
americans
would
right
now
have
died.
when
the
virus
"arrived,"
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
you
know
"that,"
especially
with
ventilators
and
equipment
and
masks
and
shields.
we're
delivering
life-saving
therapies
that
have
achieved
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
of
any
major
country
in
the
world.
and
you
don't
hear
that
from
the
fake
news.
europe's
excess
mortality
rate
is
24%
higher.
and
these
are
statistics
that
come
from
people
that
do
this
"stuff,"
right?
this
is
not
done
by
my
secretary.
24%
higher
than
the
united
states
and
despite
their
punitive
"lockdowns,"
they're
once
again
seeing
a
spike.
they're
seeing
a
big
spike
in
cases
over
there.
they
did
the
heavy
"lockdowns,"
just
like
you're
doing
right
here.
and
they're
seeing
a
spike.
and
there's
no
reason
for
that.
the
united
states
has
experienced
the
smallest
contraction
of
any
major
western
nation.
think
of
that.
and
by
"far,"
the
fastest
recovery.
and
if
they
wrote
about
it
"properly,"
it
would
be
a
proper
"thing,"
a
proper
thing
to
do.
through
our
historic
relief
"programs,"
we've
saved
more
than
half
a
trillion
nevada
cops
and
jobs
and
all
of
this
yet.
so
many
people
going
out.
we've
saved
"42,000"
nevada
businesses.
think
of
that.
biden
would
terminate
this
comeback.
he
wants
to
end
it.
he
would
terminate
this
comeback.
he
would
put
your
families
in
danger.
he
will
totally
destroy
social
security.
and
in
my
"opinion,"
if
you
look
at
what
he's
going
to
do
to
"medicare,"
they
will
destroy
social
security.
they
will.
you
called
it.
you
know
what
you're
talking
about?
"exactly,"
right.
he's
going
to
massively
raise
your
taxes.
reimpose
crippling
federal
"regulations,"
destroy
your
social
security
and
destroy
protections
for
pre-existing
conditions.
he's
going
to
destroy
that
and
decimate
your
401ks
and
retirement
savings
and
stocks.
your
stocks
are
going
to
go
down
like
you
never
saw
anything
go
down
before.
he'll
obliterate
your
second
amendment.
he'll
give
you…
and
he
"would,"
he
would
give
free…
he
wants
to
give
free
healthcare
to
illegal
aliens
that
will
bankrupt
medicare.
he
wants
to
give…
you
saw
him
raise
his
hand.
remember
the
debate
where
they're
all
standing
there
and
he
looked
"around,"
"\"who's"
going
to
give
free
healthcare
to
illegal
"aliens?\""
and
everyone's
raising
hands.
he's
"going,"
"\"oh…\""
now
take
a
look.
i'm
not
kidding.
it's
sad.
it's
pathetic.
he
would
end
our
travel
bans
on
jihadist
regions
and
increase
refugee
admissions
"700%,"
opening
the
flood
gates
to
terror-afflicted
nations.
you
understand
that.
he'll
establish
a
national
sanctuary
city
policy
for
"criminal,"
illegal
aliens.
he
loves
sanctuary
"cities,"
meaning
the
people
that
control
him
love
sanctuary
cities.
"biden,"
pledges
to
oppose
school
choice.
and
he
has
stated
that
if
he
is
elected
charter
schools
are
"\"gone\"."
they're
gone.
in
the
second
"term,"
and
we've
already
started
it
very
"heavily,"
i
will
provide
school
choice
to
every
parent
in
america.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
jobs
and
a
limitless
future
for
all
americans.
instead
of
letting
washington
change
"us,"
despite
all
that
we've
been
through
and
we've
been
through
more
than
any
president
has
ever
been
through
with
these
characters
and
they're
falling
one
after
another.
but
you
do
notice
that
i
hope.
one
after
another.
"oh,"
i
see
the
phones
have
been
wiped
out.
i
wonder
what
that's
all
"about,"
but
that's
a
criminal
thing
you
did.
we
are
changing
washington.
we
are
changing
washington.
never
forget
that
they're
coming
after
me
because
i
am
fighting
for
you.
and
it's
true.
over
the
next
four
years
to
"conclude,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world.
and
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we
will
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
states.
we
will
rapidly
return
to
full
"employment,"
soaring
economies
and
a
record
"prosperity,"
even
greater
than
last
year.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increase
penalties
for
assaults
on
law
"enforcement,"
surge
federal
prosecutors
into
high
crime
communities
and
ban
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
"justices,"
and
believe…
we
will
believe
in
enforcing
the
law.
we
want
law
and
order.
we
have
to
have
it.
we
will
ensure
equal
justice
for
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
speech
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
citizens
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
endless
foreign
wars.
and
we
are
bringing
our
troops
home
as
we
speak
tonight.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military
might
and
we
will
ensure
peace
through
strength.
we
will
end
surprise
medical
"billing,"
require
price
transparency.
it's
already
"signed,"
starts
on
january
1st.
i
don't
want
anyone
to…
i
know
ours
is
a
big
deal.
i
don't
want
sleepy
joe
to
take
care
of…
can
you
imagine?
i'll
be
watching.
"\"prices"
have
dropped
substantially
all
throughout
the
country
because
of
"price…\""
and
i'm
the
one
that
got
it
done.
and
he'll
"say,"
"\"what"
did
i
do?
what
did
i
do?
how
did
this
"happen?\""
and
we'll
further
reduce
health
insurance
premiums
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs.
we
just
did
favored
nations.
we're
going
to
come
down
to
the
lowest
price
anywhere
in
the
world
because
we
did
a
favored
nations
clause.
you
know
what
that
is?
we
will…
the
drug
companies
don't
exactly
like
me
too
much.
they're
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
negative
commercials.
please
understand
when
you
see
those
"commercials,"
it
means
your
drug
prices
are
coming
down.
we
will
strongly
protect
medicaid
and
social
"security,"
which
they
will
give
up.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united

will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on

we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students
and
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools.
and
we
will
teach
our
children
to
love

honor
our

a
big

we've
already
won

already
won.
i
like
ours
better.
we
just
take
it.
just
take
it.
we've
won
it.
i
like
it
that
better.
you
know
they
say
they're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
problems
tomorrow.
i
hate
to
tell
you
this.
i
don't
know.
have
you
heard?
i
hear
their
computers
are
all
messed
up.
just
like
they
were
in
iowa.
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
count
their

they're
going
to
tell
you
about

they're
going
to
tell
you
about
our

and
the
jet

and
the

but
they
can't
count

they
just
can't
count
them.
they
can't
count
"votes,"
but
they're
saying
they
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
again.
they're
still
trying
to
tell
us.
i
called
up
"yesterday,"
how
are
they
doing
in
iowa?
was
that
two
weeks
ago?
they
say
we're
getting
close.
they're
not
getting
"close,"
they'll
never
know.
they'll
never
"know,"

i
hear
the
same
thing
could
happen
tomorrow.
i
hope
it
"doesn't,"
actually.
i
hope
it
"doesn't,"

i'm
delighted

say
that
"wrong,"
you
got
problems.
you
say
"nevada,"
they
"go,"
what
the
hell?
got
to
be
nevada.
with

special

we
celebrate
one
of
the
greatest
moments
in

some
people
say
it
was
the
single
greatest
moment
in
the
history
of
sports.
it
was
called
the
miracle
on
ice.
do
you
remember
that?
that
was
when
the
russians
had
a
team
assembled.
that
was
"probably,"
they
say
maybe
the
greatest
team
ever
assembled.
they
were
unbelievable.
and
our
guys
played
a
practice
game
with
them
was
it
a
couple
of
weeks
"before,"
and
i
hate
to
tell
you
the
score
was
10
to
"3,"
and
the
usa
was
not
on
"top,"
and
this
team
was
an
incredible
team
and
they
went
in

it
was
"amazing,"

years
since

incredible.
that
was
incredible.
most
of
you
remember
that.
i'm
looking.
we've
got
a
lot
of

we've
got
a

eight
"years,"
2028
you
know
what?
unless
i'm
still
president
"then,"
which
is
a
distinct
"possibility,"
i
won't
be
"here,"
and
you
know
what
they'll
do?
i'll
"say,"
how's
the
olympics
going?
does
anybody
have
a
ticket
for
the
president
that
got
the
olympics
to
come
here?
they'll
"say,"
i
want
to
thank
and
they'll
thank
hundreds
of
"people,"
but
they
won't
thank
you
president
that
i'm
the
one
that
pulled
it
off.
but
that's
okay.
2028
olympics
is
coming
to
los
angeles.
it's
going
to
be
great.
and
we
worked
with
the
mayor
of
los
angeles.
he
was
great.
he
called
up
and
we
gave
him
a
lot
of
help.
i
was
president
elect
then
because
the
president
didn't
want
to
get
involved.
he
didn't
want
to
get
involved
in
getting
the
"olympics,"
so
they
called
me
and
i
was
president
"elect,"
hadn't
taken
office.
then
i
got
involved
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
they
were
happy
we
got
involved.
it
was
great.
it's
going
to
be
very
exciting
today.
we
are
thrilled
to
have
with
us
14
players
of
that
really
incredible
gold
medal
team.
give
him
a
big
hand.
and
they
were
amazed.
they
"said,"
boy
is
a
big
crowd.
i
"said,"
it's
only
because
you
guys
are
coming.
this
day
was
supposed
to
be
for
this
evening.
and
i
"said,"
let
me
get
back
to
"washington,"
do
it
early.
so
we
gave
you
almost
no
notice.
you
have
thousands
of
people
"outside,"
thousands
of
people
inside.
you
had
to
"see,"
we
were
in
iowa
we
were
in
new
hampshire.
you
saw
what
happened
in
colorado
last.
that
was
unbelievable.
every
place
we
go
it's
the
same.
it's
been
incredible.
i
don't
know
if
you
saw
the
pictures
last
night
of
the
outside
in
colorado.
it
was
incredible.
it
was.
you
could
have
filled
that
arena
up
four
times
and
it
was
a
big
"arena,"
and
it's
something.
so
i
hated
to
do
it
to
you
at
12
o'clock
but
i
"said,"
let's
go.
i
want
to
get
back.
we
got
to
deal
with
china.
we
got
to
deal
with
russia.
we
got
to
deal
with
north
"korea,"
south
korea.
we
got
to
deal
with
the
rest
of
the
world.
get
my
people
back.
we
got
to
get
the
hell
out
of
"here,"
right?
but
we
have
a
lot
of
time.
i'd
like
now
to
invite
these
incredible
sport
legends
to
join
me
on
stage.

friend
of
mine
and

a
bike.

welcome
everybody
to
ironic
we
happen
to
be
here

our
40th
"anniversary,"

vegas
knights
flew
the
whole
team
out
to
honor
us
tonight
and
for
the
weekend
and
we
obviously
thank
the
people
of
las
vegas
for
having
us
here
and
we're
looking
forward
to
celebrating
a
special
"time,"
and
it's
a
great
honor
for
the
president
to
invite
us
to
be
part
of
this
event
as
well.
so
"vegas,"

shooting.
he
doesn't
know
how
many
you
rebuffed.
how
many
did
you
rebuff?
37.
so
let
me
ask
"you,"

that
as
"goaltender,"
because
that
was
incredible.
was
that
the
greatest
game
you
ever
played?
you've
had
a
lot
of
great
games.
but
was
that
the
greatest
game
you've
ever
played?
it
was
slightly
important.

more
years
left
for
them.
look
at
that.
look
at
the
press.
hey
"mike,"
look
at
the
fake
news
back
there.
it's
a
lot.
i
always
say
that's
like
the
academy
awards
used
to
be.
this
"year,"
we
had
a
"movie,"
they
said
best
"movie,"
they
announced
the
movie
from
south
korea.
i
"said,"
what's
that
all
about?
the
movie
was
made
in
south
korea.
"look,"
i
get
along
great
with
south
"korea,"
but
you
"know,"
i
never
saw
that
one
before.
they
used
to
go
best
foreign
"movie,"
but
now
we
do
it
that
way.
i
don't
get
"it,"
but
that's
what
it
used
to
be
and
this
is
really
an
incredible
time.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
for
our
"country,"
that's
why
i
like
to
see
things
that
we
do
get
honored
because
nobody
is
doing
what
we
do.
nobody
can
do
it
like
us.
we're
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
again.
we
have
the
greatest
people.
we
have
the
greatest
military
by
far.
we've
totally
rebuilt
our
military.
jobs
are
"booming,"
incomes
are
"surging,"
poverty
is
plummeting.
factories
are
returning
confidence
is
"soaring,"
like
these
"guys,"
the
confidence
is
"soaring,"
but
you
"know,"
we
do
have
somebody
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
because
this
team
"is,"
they
had
a
"coach,"
and
that
coach
was
a
very
inspirational
"coach,"
would
you
say
mike?
and
i'd
like
to
have
maybe
one
of
you
come
up
and
just
say
a
few
words
about
coach
brooks
because
he
was
"very,"
"very,"
he
was
really
a
"big,"
he
was
a
big
heart
on
this
team.
please.
say
something.
so
tell
me
one
"thing,"
one
thing.
so
i
see
those
tears.
that
means
you
"think,"
you
miss
him
and
you
love
him.
right?
was
he
actually
a
nice
guy?
because
he
looked
tough.
mike
was
just
saying
he
was
"brutal,"
but
he
was
a
good
"guy,"
right?
tough
but
great.
thank
you
very
much.
thanks
kelly.
thank
you
all.
greatest
sports
story
could
be
number
one.
so
a
lot
of
"people,"
a
lot
of
these
sports
"experts,"
sports
writers
have
voted
that
as
the
single
greatest
sporting
event
or
athletic
achievement.
i
think
"so,"
yeah?
they
put
it
number
"one,"
certainly
top
five.
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
we
have
a
lot
of
things
that
we've
done
to
break
records.
we're
going
to
go
over
"them,"
but
we've
broken
a
lot
of
records
"now,"
but
i
want
to
thank
that
great
team
for
being
with
us.
very
inspirational.
this
is
a
big
day.
the
anniversary.
thank
you
fellas.
thank
you.
in
my
state
of
the
union
"address,"
i
proudly
declare
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
american
comeback
and
we're
just
getting
started.
after
three
years
of
ridiculous
witch
hunts
and
partisan
democrat
crusades.
by
the
"way,"
i
think
they're
starting
another
one.
did
you
see
that?
i
see
these
phoneys.
these
are
the
do
nothing
democrats.
they
said
today
that
putin
wants
to
be
sure
that
trump
gets
elected.
here
we
go
again.
here
we
go
again.
did
you
see
it?
a
story.
aren't
people
bored?
"now,"
does
that
include
because
a
couple
of
weeks
"ago,"
crooked
hillary
said
chelsea
"gabbard,"
right.
tulsi
gabbard
and
right?
she
was
a
russian
agent.
tulsi
and
also
stein
from
jill
stein.
i
don't
know
jill
stein.
i
never
met
the
woman.
she
is
a
green
party
candidate
or
was
they
said
she's
an
agent
of
russia.
i
don't
know
her
and
i
don't
know
tulsi.
the
only
thing
i
know
about
both
of
them
is
they're
not
agent.
they
are
not
agents
of
russia.
these
people
are
sick.
that's
pencil
"neck,"
pencil
neck
again.
little
pencil.
"no,"
i
just
see
it
again.
i
was
told
that
was
happening.
i
was
told
a
week
ago.
they
said
they're
trying
to
start
a
rumor.
it's
disinformation.
that's
the
only
thing
they're
good
at.
they're
not
good
at
anything
else.
they
get
nothing
done.
do
nothing
democrats.
that
putin
wants
to
make
sure
get
elected.
listen
to
this.
so
doesn't
he
want
to
see
who
the
democrat's
going
to
be?
wouldn't
you
rather
"have,"
let's
say
bernie?
wouldn't
he
rather
that
bernie
who
honeymooned
in
moscow?
wouldn't
that
be?
these
people
are
crazy.
that's
all
they
think
about.
they
don't
think
about
the
country.
they
don't
think
about
jobs.
they
don't
think
about
lowering
your
drug
costs.
infrastructure.
these
people
are
crazy.
trust
"me,"
i
like
what
we're
doing
and
i
love
this
country.
i
love
this
country.
"now,"
and
i
campaigned
on
"it,"
at
the
same
time
we
want
to
get
along
with
"russia,"
we
want
to
get
along
with
"china,"
we
want
to
get
along
with
all
these
countries.
who
the
hell
needs
to
have
conflict?
but
these
people
are
"sick,"
they
are
sick
people.
the
radical
left's
attempts
to
poison
our
democracy
and
overturn
the
last
election
have
totally
ended
in
a
big
fat
failure.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
saw
"today,"
single
best
day
i've
ever
had
is
the
polls
and
any
poll
that
the
fake
news
gives
"you,"
because
the
real
numbers
are
"higher,"
but
any
poll
they
give
you
as
a
fake.
but
"wisconsin,"
the
great
state
of
"wisconsin,"
i
was
leading
by
"many,"
"many,"
many
points
against
every
one
of
these
characters.
can
you
believe
it?
we
got
a
new
one.
mini
mike.
how
did
he
do
in
the
debate
the
other
day?
mini
mike.
here's
a
box
mike.
here
mike.
mini
mike.
he
was
a
beauty.
what
happened
huh?
he
couldn't
breathe.
what
happened?
mike
would
like
to
know
how
about
that
pocahontas
screaming
at
him.
she
forgot.
she
forgot
that
she
lied
about
her
own
heritage.
she
said
she
was
an
indian
because
she
had
high
cheekbones.
that
was
the
only
thing.
remember
what
i
"said,"
i
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
she
has
and
i
have
none.
right?
i
have
none.
to
the
best
of
my
"knowledge,"
wouldn't
mind
having
"some,"
but
i
happen
to
have
none.
and
she
choked
and
she
went
out
and
got
a
report
done.
"one,"
1
thousandth
and
24
you
know
what
that
means?
that
means
probably
i
do
have
more.
now
why
did
he
bring
that
up
when
she
was
screaming
at
him?
why?
because
he
was
gasping
for
breath.
i
can't
breathe.
i
can't
breathe.
she's
hitting
me
too
hard.
pocahontas.
"well,"
she
won
that
debate
cause
mike
could
not
respond.
that's
what
they
all
said.
they
all
said
that.
that's
funny.
i
"won,"
they're
all
shouting.
it's
not
me
that's
saying
it.
fake
news.
you
fake
news
people.
"no,"
they
all
said
it
though.
who
won
the
debate?
trump.
you
know
what?
the
way
i
look
at
"it,"
when
fake
news
cnn
"oops,"
there
goes
the
camera
off.
red
light
just
went
off.
"see,"
i
can
tell
every
one
of
them.
i
know
them
by
heart.
i
know
the
operators.
i
know
the
camera
men.
they're
okay.
they're
all
on
our
side
by
the
way.
they're
screamed
at.
get
that
camera
off.
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
get
that
camera
"off,"
or
it's
going
to
be
you
job.
all
"right,"
i'm
sorry.
precedent.
but
how
bout
msdnc?
they're
worse
than
cnn.
and
they're
owned
by
people
that
really
are
bad.
i
think
they're
very
bad
for
our
country.
the
owners
of
"comcast,"
rotten
"company,"
bad
for
our
"country,"
very
bad.
they
"try,"
they
have
all
these
pr
things
to
try
and
keep
their
image
nice
and
clean.
what
they
do
on
television
is
so
disgusting.
i
think
in
the
old
days
you
had
to
have
licenses
for
this
"stuff,"
right?
they
can
say
whatever
they
want
to
say.
let's
see
what
happens
over
the
next
period
of
time.
bunch
of
dishonest
people.
"comcast,"
terrible
company.
terrible
people
running
that
company.
and
you
know
"what,"
i
had
celebrity
"apprentice,"
i
had
the
apprentice
on
for
14
"seasons,"
14
"seasons,"
and
they
used
to
come
to
my
office
and
they
would
kiss
my
ass.
please
sign.
please.
please
sign.
it's
an
interesting
story.
they
came
and
we
"signed,"
you
know
who
signed
"me,"
jeff
zucker.
it's
one
of
the
only
things
he's
done
good
in
"broadcasting,"
but
i
signed
and
"nbc,"
as
you
"know,"
is
owned
by
"comcast,"
but
i
signed
and
they
figured
the
show
would
be
a
total
failure.
so
they
only
signed
me
for
one
season.
you
know
i
was
going
to
have
it.
it
was
go
on
and
then
the
show
"goes,"
started
at
ten
went
to
"eight,"
went
to
"seven,"
went
to
"five,"
went
to
"four,"
went
to
two.
it
went
to
one.
i
had
the
number
one
show
in
all
of
television.
number
one.
it
was
a
phenomenal
and
the
final
"episode,"
remember
that?
with
"the,"
you
remember
that?
do
you
remember
the
final?
we
"had,"
i
don't
"know,"
it
was
one
of
the
biggest
shows
of
the
year.
it
was
a
tremendous
success
there.
but
here
i
"was,"
i
signed
with
nbc
and
they
didn't
even
want
to
waste
the
ink
on
an
option.
usually
they
have
an
option
for
"not,"
you
"know,"
just
like
they
didn't
do
it.
you
stupid
people.
so
they
paid
me
very
little
for
the
first
season
i
think
"$25,000"
a
"show,"
which
is
considered
not
good.
that's
okay.
it
was
fun.
i
didn't
know
it
was
going
to
be
"success,"
you
know?
"hey,"
just
like
this
was
successful.
it's
a
recent.
because
when
i
left
and
arnold
schwarzenegger
and
i
like
arnold
said
some
very
nice
"things,"
so
i'm
"not,"
but
the
show
did
not
exactly
succeed
when
i
"left,"
but
i
had
it
on
and
they
wanted
me
to
sign
for
more
and
i
"said,"
"no,"
i'm
going
to
run
for
president
but
i'll
never
forget.
i
looked
"at,"
i
didn't
know
anything
about
this
business
and
i
had
an
"agent,"
wonderful
guy
from
william
"morris,"
and
he
"said,"
"sir,"
i
don't
want
you
to
sign.
no
business
show
has
ever
done
well
on
network
television.
"well,"
it's
not
"business,"
it's
"entertainment,"
celebrity.
"sir,"
i
don't
want
you
to
sign.
"sir,"
don't
sign.
i
"said,"
"yeah,"
okay.
but
i
have
a
problem.
i
shook
the
hand
of
somebody
i
have
to.
and
mark
burnett
was
great.
he
was
my
guy
and
but
we
shook
hands.
so
i
have
"to,"
but
i
"agreed,"
you
"know,"
i
didn't
know
that
no
business
or
no
business
type
show
had
ever
succeeded
on
a
network
television.
so
he
"said,"
i
don't
want
you
to
sign
"sir,"
break
it.
i
"said,"
i
can't
break
it.
can't
break
it.
"anyway,"
so
the
show
i
said
started
at
"ten,"
went
to
"nine,"
went
to
"became,"
it
was
the
number
one
show
all
of
a
"sudden,"
and
the
agent
called
me
up
and
he
"said,"
"sir,"
i
remember
it
was
six
in
the
morning.
i
was
in
bed.
he
"said,"
"sir,"
the
show
just
went
to
number
one.
i'd
love
to
see
you
because
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
more
money.
i
"said,"
you
didn't
want
me
to
do
the
show.
"well,"
not
really.
i
"mean,"
i
was
okay.
he
"said,"
i'd
really
like
more
money.
i
"said,"
"jim,"
i
like
you
very
"much,"
"jim,"
you're
fired.
get
out.
"anyway,"
i
had
14
great
seasons
over
about
11
years
because
it
was
so
"successful,"
they
kept…
they
would
have
run
it.
remember
when
they
did
the
three
"hours,"
the
whole
night
was
the
apprentice.
i
"said,"
wait
a
minute.
gone
with
the
"wind,"
to
mention
the
movie
a
second
"time,"
gone
with
the
wind
is
shorter.
they
had
the
apprentice
on
for
three
hours.
i
said
even
i
think
it's
too
long.
you
can't
put
it
up
for
three.
you
got
leave
a
little
bit
like
i
want
to
come
back
next
week.
but
they
had
it
on
for
three
weeks.
we
did
fantastically
with
it.
comcast
did
great.
nbc
did
great.
they
wanted
me
to
sign
for
another
three
years.
i
"said,"
"no,"
i'm
going
to
for
president.
and
that
was
actually
the
time
when
i
knew
i
was
going
to
run.
because
you
know
how
they
were
paying
a
lot
of
money
and
whether
you're
rich
or
"not,"
it's
still
a
lot
of
money.
i
don't
care
how
rich
you
are.
it's
a
lot.
millions
and
millions
of
dollars.
and
i
said
"no,"
i'm
going
to
run
for
president.
and
i
did
that.
but
from
the
day
i
"ran,"
they
went
from
"being,"
you
know
one…
but
from
the
day
i
"ran,"
they
went
from
being
"wonderful,"
they
were
nice.
they
were
nice.
i
guess
if
i
didn't
do
well
with
the
show
they
wouldn't
have
been
nice
because
they
weren't
nice
to
other
people
that
failed.
people
that
didn't
have
good
"ratings,"
that
business
is
a
very
simple
business.
if
you
have
good
"ratings,"
you
can
treat
them
like
garbage.
if
you
have
bad
"ratings,"
you
can
"say,"
"\"sir,"
i
really
respect
you
so
"much.\""
get
out
of
here.
get
him
out
of
my
yard.
they're
very
ruthless
people.
but
comcast
is
a
rotten
company.
they
forgot
totally.
and
they
are
worse
than
cnn.
i
will
tell
you
that
right
now.
comcast
is
worse
than
cnn.
we
should
call
it
"comcast,"
because
that's
their
beautiful
maiden
"name,"
comcast.
they're
worse
than
cnn.
"i'll,"
tell
you
something
about
cnn.
jake
"tapper,"
today
he
put
out…
now
i
know
you
don't
like
him.
i
know.
who
likes
him?
who
the
hell
can
like
him?
i
think
his
wife
likes
him.
actually.
i
really
believe
she
does.
but
let
me
just
tell
"you,"
he
put
out
a
couple
of
social
media
posts
"today,"
because
i
never
call
it
"tweet,"
i
call
it
social
media
because
it's
much
bigger
than
tweet.
what
we
"have,"
dan
scavino.
the
great
dan
scavino.
we
have
won
five
sites.
we're
number
one
on
"twitter,"
we're
number
one
on
"facebook,"
and
the
whole
world.
the
whole
world.
so
it's
powerful.
but
jake
tapper
put
out
some
"things,"
basically
"saying,"
i
believe
"it,"
that's
the
way
i
read
"it,"
that
the
new
russian
thing
that
started
"yesterday,"
that
putin
wants
to
be
sure
that
"trump,"
which
give
me
a
break.
give
me
a
break.
but
jake
tapper
said
it
ain't
"so,"
and
if
he
did
say
that
because
they
were
a
little
"complex,"
they
can
turn
them
"around,"
or
when
zucker
sees
him
and
"said,"
"\"why"
did
you
put
that?
i
want
that
deleted
and
i
want
you
to
do
a
different
"one.\""
but
he
did
say
that.
so
i
respect
that
because
it's
another
hoax
story.
but
we're
standing
up
for
the
defense
of
our
"constitution,"
for
our
"freedom,"
and
democracy
itself.
you
know
that.
i
got
to
get
that.
"hey,"
bobby?
bobby?
see
that
guy?
i
love
that
shirt.
"bobby,"
i
don't
know.
he
looks
like
a
nice
guy.
can
you
please
walk
him
"up,"
even
if
you
have
about
five.
come
"here,"
come
here.
come
here.
come
here.
you
got
to
see
this
shirt.
you
got
to
see
this
shirt.
i
love
it.
i've
got
to
order
me
one
that
i
can
ride
around.
come
on.
come
on
up
here.
he
looks
safe.
he
doesn't
look
like
he's
going
to
start
a
fist
fight.
he's
a
good
"fan,"
i
guess.
you
got
to
see
this
shirt.
i
love
it.
is
there
any
place
that's
more
fun
than
a
trump
rally?
right?
how
many
rallies
have
you
been
to?
80?
80?
80.
he
said
80
rallies.
come
up
here.
come
on.
come
on.
come
on.
look
at
these
two
guys.
these
guys
are
serious.
these
are
serious
"fans,"
right?
are
you
with
him?
are
you
with
him?
are
you
with
him?
you're
with
him?
come
on.
come
up
here.
man.
and
look
at
this
guy
come
on.
thank
"you,"
fellas.
wow.
i
just
"said,"
"\"how"
long
have
you
two
been
"together?\""
i
figured
they'd
"say,"
"\"we're"
"married.\""
he
met
her
at
the
rally
in
colorado.
can
you
believe
this?
can
you
believe
it?
"man,"
did
he
get
lucky.
they
both
got
"lucky,"
right?
they
both
got
lucky.
"well,"
that's
cool.
"no,"
i
just
see
there's
so
much
stuff
out
here.
it's
"genius,"
actually.
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
with
viral
"hoaxes,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
"border,"
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
as
you
"heard,"
we
added
another
"225,000"
new
jobs
last
month
alone.
way
above
anticipated
schedule.
and
that
makes
7
million
new
jobs
since
the
election.
the
number
was
supposed
to
be
under
2
million
and
we
added
7
million.
and
"remember,"
if
i
give
you
wrong
"numbers,"
the
fake
news
is
going
to
have
headlines.
"\"trump"
gave
you
"wrong…\""
i
"mean,"
it's
very
tough.
i've
got
to
be
very
careful.
even
if
i
give
you
wrong
in
the
wrong
"way,"
they'll
say
it
was
wrong.
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
but
it
was
wrong
in
the
low
"way.\""
"no,"
that's
no
good
either.
got
to
be
very
precise
with
these
characters.
the
democrats
don't
have
to
"be,"
but
we
have
to
be.
we've
destroyed
he
isis
territorial
caliphate
"100%,"
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
isis.
al
baghdadi
is
dead.
al
baghdadi
is
dead.
17
years.
they
looked
for
him.
17
years.
al-baghdadi.
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
when
i
came
in.
he's
the
founder
of
isis
and
when
i
came
in
three
years
"ago,"
isis
was
all
over
the
place.
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
knock
it
"out.\""
we
knocked
it
out
of
"syria,"
"and,"
iraq
and
other
places.
we
really
knocked
at
100%.
remember
i
wanted
to
leave.
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right.\""
we
were
at
"96%,"
then
"98,"
then
99%.
i
"said,"
"\"let"
some
of
these
other
countries
do
"it.\""
wouldn't
you
"say,"
right?
so
what
happened
is
i
wanted
to
leave
and
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
we
want
"100%.\""
so
we
wait
and
stayed.
we
got
"100%,"
then
we
moved
them
all
out
of
"syria,"
except
we
did
keep
the
oil.
you
noticed
"that,"
right?
we
kept
the
oil.
sorry.
they
"said,"
"\"he"
left
soldiers
in
"syria.\""
"yeah,"
i
did
to
keep
the
"oil,"
if
you
don't
mind.
which
is
what
we
should
have
done
in
iraq
"too,"
by
the
way.
i
would
have
done
that.
i'm
making
a
lot
of
money
with
all
that
oil.
but
you
remember
that
whole
"thing,"
that
whole…
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
find
al
"baghdadi.\""
i've
been
saying
that
actually
for
two
years.
i
had
a
lot
of
other
things
to
do
the
first
"year,"
like
fight
off
the
democrats.
these
crazy
democrats
with
their
hoaxes.
think
of
it.
if
they
use
their
"genius,"
because
they
are
genius
at
that
"stuff,"
right?
they're
really
good.
they
can
take
nothing.
they
can
take
a
perfect
phone
call
made
to
the
ukrainian
president
who
said
very
specifically
there
was
no
pressure.
he
doesn't
even
know
what's
going
on
and
they
can
take
this
perfect
call.
thank
goodness
i
had
a
transcriber.
do
you
agree
with
it?
because
the
fake
whistleblower
said
that
the
call
was
totally
different
than
what
the
call
was.
so
when
i
released
the
"call,"
when
i
released
the
"transcripts,"
they
died.
they
"said,"
"\"oh"
we
got
a
"problem.\""
they
never
thought
i
was
going
to
do
"it,"
but
i
had
no
choice.
i
had
to
because
i
had
to
show
they're
liars.
but
think
of
"it,"
they
can
take
something
like
"that,"
a
perfect
phone
"call,"
or
they'll
take
just
out
of
thin
air
they
can
make
something
up.
and
they
ended
up
"today,"
front
"page,"
new
york
times.
they
used
to
call
it
the
eighth
column.
that's
the
big
column
on
the
right.
i
don't
know.
the
papers
become
so
small.
i
don't
know
if
they
have
an
eighth
column
anymore.
they
used
to
have
the
eighth
"column,"
was
a
big
"deal,"
right?
that
was
the
big
deal.
today
it's
too
narrow.
think
they're
probably…
after
i'm
"gone,"
they
won't
have
any
columns.
that's
why
eventually
they're
going
to
support
me.
"eventually,"
the
times
and
the
washington
"post,"
which
will
be
dead
as
a
doornail
after
i
"leave,"
and
the
"cnn,"
it'll
be
an
obsolete
"business,"
the
cable
business.
msdnc
will
be
out
of
business.
you
"know,"
cable
was
supposed
to
be
obsolete
and
now
they're
doing
the
highest
numbers
they've
ever
done.
if
an
airplane
goes
down
with
700
"people,"
they
don't
cover
it.
if
it's
not
trump
"related,"
they
don't
cover
it.
it's
got
to
be
trump
or
trump
related.
so
if
a
plane
goes
down
and
it's
total
"devastation,"
if
the
ship
goes
"down,"
if
the
titanic-
if
the
titanic
equivalent
went
"down,"
they
wouldn't
cover
it
unless
i
was
on
the
sucker.
it's
true.
they
wouldn't
cover
it.
the
fake
news
would
not
cover
the
equivalent
of
the
titanic.
but
you
know
what
they're
going
to
do
before
the
election?
they're
going
to
"say,"
"\"we"
want
to
just
say
something.
we're
going
to
endorse
the
"president.\""
you
know
why?
because
they'll
be
out
of
business.
can
you
imagine
if
they
had
to
cover
mini
mike?
who
i
don't
"think,"
i
think
he's
"gone,"
but
you
know
what?
he'll
spend
another
500
million.
don't
forget
i
spent
70
and
i
"won,"
of
my
money.
in
other
"words,"
they
"said,"
and
this
was
in
the
new
york
"times,"
i
said
the
other
night
in
colorado.
i
spent
"70,"
mini
mike
so
far
has
spent
almost
$500
million
dollars
in
order
to
get
embarrassed
by
pocahontas.
pocahontas.
and
she's
"mean,"
isn't
she?
did
you
see
that?
do
you
see
the
anger
on
her
face?
that
nervous
energy.
she's
jumping
up
and
down.
she's
a
mess.
but
"no,"
"no,"
she's
mean.
right?
right?
that
face
is
just…
"\"you"
want
to
get
"him?\""
she
"said,"
"\"i"
got
him.
i
want
to
see
those
"agreements.\""
"\"i,\""
"\"you"
open
up
those
"agreements.\""
this
poor
guy
probably
signed
a
hundred
of
them
and
each
one's
a
disaster.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
want
to
open
those
agreements.
nobody
told
me
this
was
going
to
"happen.\""
"said,"
"\"actually,"
"sir.\""
"\"nobody"
told
me.
get
me
out
of
"here.\""
after
the
"debate,"
he
went
"backstage,"
fired
a
lot
of
people.
he
"said,"
"\"how"
the
hell
did
you
get
me
into
this
"thing?\""
but
pocahontas
was
really
"mean,"
but
she's
going
to
be
easy.
i
hope
it's
her.
it's
not
going
to
be
her.
can't
"be,"
i
don't
think.
alfred
e.
"neuman,"

and
"gentlemen,"
introducing

nobody
knows
because
you're
all
too
young.
nobody
knows
who
alfred…
it's

they
all

no.

see
nobody

who
alfred

is.
only
the
real

they're

they
love

but
that's
only
15%
of
the
"crowd,"
right?
am
i
right?
better
than
howdy
doody.
howdy
doody.
and
that's
what
happens
when
you
can't
get
the
words
out.
no
it
does.
that's
what
"happens,"
right?
when
you
can't
get
the
words
"out,"
you
get
angry.
you
get
angry
because
you
can't
get
the
words.
that
might
happen
to
me
someday.
can
you
imagine
if
that
happened
to
me?
"man,"
would
i
be
a
bad
guy.
i'd
be
the
meanest
man
in
history.
"no,"
but
biden
is
very
angry.
he
gets
"angrier,"
and
"angrier,"
and
angrier.
he's
changed.
and
then
you
have
the
tom.
yeah.
he
said
tom
steyer.
tom
"said,"
"\""
mister
"impeachment.\""
how
did
that
work
"out,"
tom?
thank
you
very
much
for
the
great
poll
numbers
between
him
and
nervous
dancing.
how
did
that
work
out?
this
schmuck
spends
$250
million
"dollars,"
he
ends
up
with
one
third
of
a
percent
in
iowa.
but
maybe
that
could
be
"rick,"
because
they
still
don't
have
any
idea
what
he
got.
maybe
he
won
"iowa,"
they
took
it
away
from
him.
"no,"
but
he
was
substantially
below
it.
all
i
"know,"
it
said
1%
and
an
arrow
left.
so
he
spends
250

never
heard
of
this
guy.
who
is
he?
where
did
he
get
his
money?
who
is
he?
he
was
in
the
coal
"business,"
did
you
know
that?
this
"guy,"
this
phony
is
a
big
environmentalist.
he
made
his
"money,"
a
lot
of
"it,"
in
the
coal
business.
nobody
knows
"that,"
but
he's
a
fake.
remember
when
he
walked
up
to
bernie
the
other
day.
"\"hi"
bernie.
"hi.\""
"oh,"
and
he
was
having
a
fight
with
"pocahontas,"
right?
is
this
the
greatest?
mark
burnett
"said,"
"\"this"
is
the
greatest
reality
show
in
"history.\""
he
"said,"
"\"you"
can
take
the
"apprentice,"
and
you
can
take
"survivor,"
and
you
can
take
every
other
reality
show
ever
"made,"
multiply
it
times
"10,000,"
and
you
still
don't
have
what
we
have.
and
even
the
"cas.\""
he
did
say
this.
you
got
the
perfect
president.
you
got
the
perfect
first
lady.
how
about
the
first
lady?
you
got
the
perfect
kids.
the
"kids,"
though.
those
beautiful
kids.
my
beautiful
kids.
they
had
such
a
great
"life,"
before
i
did
this.
"sorry,"
kids.
sorry.
my
beautiful
ivanka.
she
had
such
a
great
life.
she
had
a
company
that
was
selling
shoes
and
everything
you
could
sell.
she'd
just
put
her
name
on
it
and
she
"said,"
"\"daddy,"
does
it
matter?
i
want
to
come
to
washington
and
help
people
get
"jobs.\""
right?
ain't
that
true?
and
she
left
the
company.
and
when
you
leave
a
"company,"
all
of
a
sudden
it
doesn't
do
as
well.
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
exactly
helped
talking
about
the
wall
and
other
"things,"
but
she
left
the
"company,"
came
to
washington
and
she
said
"500,000"
jobs.
that
was
her
goal.
and
she
did
that
in
the
first
month.
she
actually
did.
she's
gotten
these
great
companies
like
"walmart,"
and
many
"others,"
"exxon,"
she's
gotten
them
to
take
millions
of
people.
she's
now
over
15
million
jobs
where
they
train
people
and
bring
them
into
the
companies.
it's
incredible.
15
million.
and
she's
smart.
she
got
it
figured
"out,"
but
most
people
"can't,"
but
she
does.
but
all
they
do
is
give
them
heat.
they
work
so
hard.
and
could
you
imagine
you
take
biden's
son.
can
you
imagine?
but
you
know
what?
we
don't
do
any
of
that
stuff.
we
don't
do
that
stuff.
we
don't
do
it.
the
kid
got
$3
million
"dollars,"
"83,000"
a
month
and
he
didn't
have
a
job
until
his
father
became
vice
president.
and
speaking
of
vice
presidents
and
speaking
also
of
reality
"television,"
because
it's
the
greatest
show
of
all
"time,"
right?
look
at
us.
look.
we
told
"you,"
"what,"
last
night?
little
change
"here,"
folks.
we're
going
to
move
it
up
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
until
12
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
little
change.
just
a
minor
change.
because
i
have
to
get
back
to
washington
to
work.
i
feel
guilty.
this
is
too
much
fun.
but
speaking
to
vice
presidents
and
speaking
of
perfect
vice
"presidents,"
if
you
become
"president,"
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
choose
a
really
"horrible,"
horrible
vice
president.
so
if
the
idiots
ever
want
to
impeach
"you,"
they
have
to
"say,"
i
can't
impeach
him.
look
who
we
have.
i
have
the
perfect
vice
president.
i
have
the
greatest
in
the
world.
i
have
the
greatest
vice
president.
i
don't
know.
i
got
the
great
ones.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
can't
do
"that.\""
i
picked
a
great
guy.
he's
done
a
fantastic
job.
he's
been
a
great
vice
president.
but
it
is
true.
i
could
have
"picked,"
i'll
give
you
"names,"
but
don't
want
to
do
that
because
i
don't
want
to
hurt
anyone's
feelings.
but
there
are
plenty
of
them
out
there.
they're
mostly
out
there
and
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
but
mike
pence
has
been
great.
but
tell
"me,"
is
it
perfect
casting
the
whole
thing?
and
this
isn't
about
"casting,"
this
is
about
real
life.
but
when
mark
burnett
said
to
me
the
other
"day,"
he
"said,"
"\"the"
greatest
reality
show
of
all
"times,"
times
of
"million.\""
that's
exactly
except
for
one
"thing,"
we
work
our
asses
off
and
we
are
doing
things
like
nobody
has
ever
done
before.
right?
right?
"so,"
we
took
out
al
baghdadi
and
then
we
just
took
out
two
weeks
ago
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
qasem
soleimani
of
"iran,"
ending
his
evil
reign
of
terror
forever.
he's
the
father
of
the
roadside
bomb.
when
you
see
our
beautiful
people
walking
around
with
no
"legs,"
they're
"walking,"
and
trying
to
walk
so
"hard,"
and
they're
really
in
rough
shape
he's
the
father
of
the…
he
loved
the
roadside
bomb.
he
thought
it
was
a
great
thing.
where
is
he
now?
soleimani.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
you
know
who's
happy
about
it?
the
people
of
iran
are
happy
and
even
the
leaders
of
"iran,"
because
the
leaders
of
iran
were
afraid
of
him.
okay?
and
the
fact
"is,"
america
is
respected
again.
we're
winning.
we're
winning
all
over.
we're
winning
in
washington
that
democrats
keep
losing
their
minds.
that
is
why
millions
of
registered
democrat
voters
are
leaving
their
party
to
join
our
movement.
"look,"
we're
a
unified
party.
the
republican
party
has
never
been
unified
like
it
is
today.
i'll
show
you.
i
could
"say,"
"\"we're"
going
to
go
over
to
the
hill.
"no,"
we're
going
to
go
over
to
someplace
and
we're
going
to
do
a
rally
at
eight
o'clock
"tonight.\""
we'd
have
tens
of
thousands
of
people
there.
there's
never
been
this.
ronald
reagan
was
great.
i
thought
he
was
a
great
"guy,"
great
"president,"
didn't
like
his
policy
on
trade.
that's
okay.
trade.
but
if
he
came
to
las
"vegas,"
you
know
they'd
have
a
"ballroom,"
and
they'd
have
"500,"
maybe
a
thousand
people.
what
we're
doing…
and
this
isn't
"even,"
i
must
say
"this,"
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
"this,"
this
is
not
election
season.
because
we're
nine
months
away.
election
season
is
when
you're
two
months
away.
we're
not
even
in
election
season
and
we
have
more
enthusiasm
now.
believe
it
or
"not,"
then
we
had
even
before
the
election
in
2016.
it's
true.
it's
too
early.
it's
too
early.
it's
true.
we
have
a
great
gentleman
and
a
woman
with
"us,"
a
friend
of
"mine,"
mister
and
misses
sheldon
"adelson,"
right
over
here.
"great,"
great
person.
two
great
people.
he's
got
so
much
"money,"
he
doesn't
know
what
the
hell
to
do
with
it.
he
owns
the
sands
hotel.
that's
like
one
of
the
smaller
businesses.
"sheldon,"
that's
like
your
small
"business,"
right?
he
is
a
great
guy.
she's
an
"incredible,"
she's
a
"doctor,"
and
she
studies
"addiction,"
and
"drugs,"
drug
"addiction,"
all
sorts
of
addictions.
and
she
knows
more
about
that
"subject,"
i
"think,"
than
"anybody,"
and
she
works
hard
and
she
doesn't
need
it.
he
does
not
need
the
money
that
she
brings
in.
okay?
he
also
happens
on
the
paper.
he
owns
the
paper.
you
own
the
paper
in
"town,"
right?
they
wanted
like
a
couple
of
hundred
million
dollars
too
much.
you
"said,"
"\"give"
it
to
them.
it's
peanuts.
what
the
hell
difference
does
it
make?
we
want
to
thank
the
adelsons.
they've
been
incredible
fans
and
they
love
israel.
they
love
israel.
i
just
saw
him
sitting
there.
i
didn't
know
they
were
here.
i
just
see
him
sitting
there.
he's
something.
the
chairman
of
the
nevada
republican
"party,"
who's
really
been
great.
he's
been
with
me
for
a
long
time
and
he's
a
very
committed
man.
make
america
great
again.
"oh,"
"oh,"
oh.
let's
do
a
poll
quick.
just
quick.
i'll
never
get
rid
of
maga
because
i'm
superstitious.
but
we
just
hit
an
all
time
high
with
the
stock
market.
our
military
is
rebuilt.
you
just
got
the
greatest
tax
cuts
in
"history,"
the
greatest
"rate,"
regulation
"cuts,"
and
all
this
stuff.
"so,"
let
me
ask
you
this.
"so,"
"\"make"
america
great
"again,\""
it
sort
of
doesn't
work
quite
as
well.
so
now
we
have
keep
america
great
and
we
have
the
new
hat.
it's
"higher,"
stiff.
it's
like
a
"billboard,"
right?
i
call
it
the
billboard.
it's
a
billboard.
so
let's
go
just
that.
because
i
am
very
surprised
by
it.
we're
going
to
keep
them
"both,"
but
i
just
curious
if
we
did
go
to
"one,"
"\"make"
america
great
"again?\""
"\""
keep
america
"great?\""
i
can't.
i
would
have
said
that's
impossible.
"\"make"
america
great
"again,\""
is
the
greatest
phrase.
a
lot
of
"people,"
"again,"
fake
"news,"
i
think
will
agree
to
it.
it's
the
greatest
phrase
ever
used
in
politics.
it's
the
greatest
phrase.
"now,"
who
has
the
greatest
phrase
ever
used
in
the
history
of
politics
and
"say,"
"\"oh,"
let's
go
with
a
new
"phrase.\""
right?
but
we're
going
to
keep
it.
so
we
have
to
keep
maga.
but
now
we
have
"cag,"
now
we
have
cag.
so
we
have
a
both.
i
just
don't
have
the
courage
to
get
rid
of
the
one.
it
would
be
too
disrespectful.
too
disrespectful.
but
michael
"mcdonald,"
i
want
to
thank
you
and
the
members
of
the
nevada
republican
central
committee.
you're
all
here.
they're
great
people.
and
the
man
came
here.
he
loves
us.
he's
been
with
us.
rick
harrison
of
the
world
famous
gold
and
silver
pawn
shop.
rick
harrison.
you
better
"win,"
michael.
"otherwise,"
that's
the
last
time
i'm
introducing
you
like
that.
i
hear
we're
up.
i
hear
we're
doing
nicely.
i
hear
we're
doing
great.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
"union,"
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
that
union.
last
"time,"
i
had
a
strike
in
my
building
during
the
election.
it's
the
only
reason
we
would
have
won
this
state.
brilliantly
to
save
three
cents.
i
could
have
settled
the
strike
before
the
election.
i
wanted
to
save
$2
total.
and
he
wasn't
too
good.
he
didn't
do
too
good.
but
we
almost
won
this
state
despite…
i
had
a
big
strike.
had
thousands
and
thousands
of
union
guys.
they
had
"it,"
"look,"
they
"wanted,"
wanted
to
show
us.
but
i
think
that
the
unions
are
really
with
us
and
the
unions
have
been
with
us.
they're
"teamsters,"
so
many
of
the
unions.
because
i'm
for
the
working
man
and
"woman,"
whether
you're
union
or
non-union.
some
states
are
all
"union,"
some
states
are
no
union.
but
we
get
them
all.
and
i
think
we're
going
to
have
tremendous
success.
and
a
lot
of
the
democrats
are
going
to
ruin
the
healthcare
programs
that
these
unions
have.
the
unions
have
worked
hard
on
healthcare
and
they're
going
to
ruin
them.
they're
going
to
take
away…
"well,"
we're
going
to…
you
can
lose
180
million
people
off
of
great
private
healthcare.
so
we'll
see
what
happens.
but
a
lot
of
the
democrats
want
to
do
that.
they
think
it's
wonderful.
but
together
we're
building
the
world's
most
prosperous
economy
and
the
most
inclusive
society.
that's
true.
since
my
"election,"
over
125-
that's
true.
since
my
"election,"
over
"125,000"
new
jobs
have
been
created
right
here
in
"nevada,"
including
over
"40,000"
new
nevada
manufacturing
and
construction
jobs.
a
30%
increase.
the
national
unemployment
rate
is
the
lowest
in
over
half
a
"century,"
and
soon
we're
going
to
have
that
be
a
historic
number
like
so
many
of
the
others.
the
average
unemployment
rate
for
my
"administration,"
this
is
the
coolest
of
them
"all,"
is
the
lowest
for
any
united
states
president
in
recorded
history.
that's
pretty
good.
when
i'm
in
a
"debate,"
they're
"saying,"
"\"we're"
going
to
do
"this.\""
i
"say,"
"\"listen,"
we
have
the
best
unemployment
numbers
in
the
history
of
our
"country.\""

got
a

of

love

who
in
this
audience
is
hispanic?
"yeah,"
we're
doing
great.
"well,"
we
should
be
doing

you
have
the

the
unemployment
rate
for

americans
has
reached
an
all
time
historic
low
and
you
got
to
remember
they're
back
there
checking
every
word.
they're
"going,\""
"oh,"
my
god.
he's
"right.\""
i
can't
say
it
because
i
got
all
these
maniacs
back
there.
they're
trying
to
find…
"\"he"
put
the
comma
in
the
wrong
place.
he
didn't
make
that
word
"plural,"
therefore
he
"lied.\""
now
i've
got
to
be
very
accurate
because
all
these
"numbers,"
they
check
them
out.
"\"they're"
in
"there,"
checking
them
out.
check
on
the
african
american
"unemployment,"
"please.\""
please
tell
me
it's
not
historic.
these
people
are
among
the
most
dishonest
human
beings
on
earth.
not
all
of
them.
workers
without
a
high
school
diploma.
we
have
millions
of
people
that
didn't
go
through
high
school.
they
left.
they
had
"problems,"
good
"problems,"
bad
"problems,"

where
they
don't
have
the
money.
they
didn't
get
a
high
school
diploma.
they've
achieved
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
those
are
important
groups
of
people.
half
a
million
more
hispanic
americans
now
own
a
home.
"now,"
hispanic
have
done
so
good.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
know
who
understands
the
"border,"
because
we
are
building
that
wall
like
crazy.
"remember,"
they
also
"said,"
"\"if"
you
build
the
wall
you'll
lose
the
hispanic
"vote.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
got
to
do
what's
right.
you
know
who
understands
the
border
better
than
anybody?
you
know
who
understands

at
the

better
than
anybody?
the
hispanics
understand
it
and
they
don't
want
to
be
working
and
have
people
come
and
take
their
job.
have
people
come
in
where
they
can't
pay
for
their
"house,"
have
people
come
in
who
are
very
bad
"people.\""
you
have
some
very
bad
people.
you
have
murderers
and
"rapists,"
and
we
have
set
all
sorts
of
records
at
the
"border,"
but
we're
up
to
122
miles
of
"wall,"
and
it
is
true.
the
people
that
understand
it
the
best
are
hispanic.
"so,"
thank
you.
we
got

put
the

you've
been
complaining
about
it

reasons
you
voted

want
to
let
anyone
from

simply
walk

then
they

for
the
amount
of

washington

want

thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
eight
straight
months
in
a
row.
and
as
the
wall
gets
"longer,"
it
gets
easier
and
easier.
remember
when
the
democrats
were
"saying,"
"\"you"
don't
need
a
"wall.\""
two
things
that
never
"change,"
right?
all
these
"computers,"
they
"said,"
"\"use"
"drones.\""
oh
"great,"
we'll
fly
over
with
drones.
watch
the
people
pour
in
by
the
thousands.
that's
great.
use
drones.
before
i
came
"along,"
they
all
wanted
a
wall.
they
just
didn't
know
how
to
build
it.
they
had
no
clue.
they
had
the
"money,"
they
actually
gave
the
money
"back,"
but
they
had
no
clue.
but
as
soon
as
i
came
in
and
i
"said,"
"\"wall,\""
they
went
against
and
i
made
a
terrible
mistake.
we
catch
them.
you
know
the
story.
they
come
"over,"
could
be
a
"killer,"
"murderer,"
rapist.
they
come
over.
we
can't
do
anything.
we
have
to
be
politically
correct.
we
catch
them.
we
then
"say,"
"\"what's"
your
"address?\""
they
don't
know.
they
don't
even
know
their
country
in
many
cases.
where
do
you
come
from?
we
don't
know
and
they
mean
"it,"
but
some
are
very
serious
criminals.
"so,"
we
catch
"them,"
we
take
whatever
they
can
"take,"
which
is
"nothing,"
and
then
we
had
to
release
them
in
our
country.
we
can't
bring
them
back.
and
then
we
have
a
system
of
"judges,"
thousands
of
judges
all
over
the
place.
you
got
to
be
like
perry
mason
and
every
illegal
that
comes
"in,"
they
have
the
lawyers.
the
lawyers
meet
"them,"
they
get
paid
"fees,"
but
we're
breaking
the
system.
no
more
catch
and
"release,"
you
think
that
was
easy?
and
the
big
thing
is
that
30
foot…
and
this
wall
is
built
exactly
to
the
specifications
of
border
patrol.
totally.
and
border
patrol
has
seized
the
largest
"amount,"
just
"recently,"
of
deadly
narcotics
ever
recorded.
the
largest
amount.
we've
deported
record
numbers
of
gang
members.
we've
done
more
to
secure
the
border
than
any
administration
in
history.
we
"are,"
as
i
"said,"
building
the
wall
faster
than
ever.
faster
and
bigger
than
anyone
thought
possible.
they
can't
believe
we're
getting
it
done.
we'll
have
over
500
miles
of
wall
built
sometime
next
year.
500
miles.
washington
democrats
have
never
been
more
extreme
than
they

of

remember

fake
"news,"
you
have
it.
"see,"
you
have
to
be
very
careful
when
you
say
impeachment
because
you
know
what
they
do?
they
go
back
and
they
write.
president
trump
said
that
obama
should
be
"impeached,"
but
he's
not
in
office
and
so
therefore
they
can't
impeach.
he
doesn't
know
what
he's
talking
about
because
he's
not
in
"office,"
so
therefore
they
can't.
"so,"
you
have
to
be
very
careful.
that's
why
i
use
the
word
belated
impeachment.
"belated,"
meaning
i'm
just
"kidding,"
okay?
they
do
it
all
the
time.
they
had
it
the
other
day.
i
"said,"
"\"bring"
back
gone
with
the
"wind,\""
right?
i
said
a
little
bit
up
"here,"
but
i
said
the
movie
the
other
day
in
"colorado,"
i
guess.
i
"said,"
"\"huh,"
south
korean
movie
"won.\""
they
"said,"
"\"ladies"
and
"gentlemen,"
the
winner
of
the
academy
award
is
"…\""
a
movie
made
in
south
"korea,"
what's
this
all
about?
and
i
deal
with
"them,"
they
like
me.
we're
helping
them
a
lot.
they're
killing
us
on
trade.
they
beat
us
on
trade
and
then
they
win
the
academy
award
for
a
fricking
movie.
but
we
redid
that
trade
"deal,"
but
the
other
day
they
got
me
on
this
one
too.
i
"said,"
"\"whatever"
happened
to

with
the
"wind,"
that
beautiful

vivian
"lee,"
clark

right?
whatever
"happened,"

of
them
"wrote,"
"\"he"

says

it
is

they're
fakers.

"now,"
anybody
sitting
there
reading
this
"saying,"
"\"man,"
"trump,"
can't
be

smart.
he
said

that's
an
old
"movie.\""
"yeah,"
it's
an
old
classic.
what
i
say
is
make
great
"movies,"
not
this
computerized
garbage.
and
i
was
never
a
fan
of
brad
"pitt,"
i
will
tell
you
that.
"no,"
i
thought
he
was
a
stiff.
he
was
a
"stiff,"
it's
like
a
boring
guy.
all
of
a
sudden
he
wins
the

so
fitting.
their
ratings
aren't
so
good
at
the
academy
awards.
you
know
when
that
stopped?
when
they
started
attacking
"us,"
their
ratings
went
right
down
the
tubers.
i
told
"somebody,"
the
evening
"newscasts,"
they're
terrible
for
conservative
people
and
they're
"crooked,"
they're
absolutely
dishonest.
i
said
to

of
the
big
"broadcasters,"
i'm
friendly
with
him.
i
"said,"
"\"if"

they
do

used

when
we
had
the
"late,"

abc
is
terrible

is
terrible

terrible.
they're
all
the

i
"said,"
"\"your"

would

sean
hannity
away
from
us.
don't
take
our
show.
that's
my
"problem,"
i
don't
want
to
take
away
any
of
our
people.
you
get
a
pete
hegseth.
you
get
a
jesse
waters.
you
get…
i
could
name
so
many
of
"them,"
right?
and
you
put
them
on
that
"broadcast,"
their
ratings
would
go
up
five
fold
but
they
don't
know
that.
i
don't
know.
they're
stupid.
their
ratings
would
go
through
the
"roof,"
but
they
would
rather
have
a
failed
broadcast
that
nobody
watches
than
put
on
a
conservative
person
and
lift
the
ratings
five
times.
they
would
rather
have
a
fail…
seven
months
ago
we
had
a
little
"skit,"
and
they
were
hoping
the
market
would
crash
because
they
would
rather
lose
their
"money,"
or
big
parts
of
"it,"
and
have
a
really
horrible
market
on
the
basis
that
"we,"
not
"me,"
we
could
not
be
elected
on
november
3rd.
this
is
how
crazy-
…
on
november
3rd.
this
is
how
"evil,"
this
is
how
crazy
they
are.
they've
gone
crazy.
i
guess
you
call
it
trump
derangement
syndrome.
but
if
they
ever
did
a
conservative
"broadcast,"
meaning
very
"fair,"
very
honest
when
i
say
"that,"
it's
almost
like
do
a
fair
broadcast.
just
a
fair
broadcast.
that
thing
would
be
the
hottest
show.
but
they
don't
realize
it.
and
if
they
"do,"
they
probably
wouldn't
do
it
anyway
because
they
don't
want
to
go
away
from
what
they're
"doing,"
which
is
crazy
because
it
"is,"
they're
doing
very
poorly.
while
the
social
and
socialist
democrats
are
trying
to
destroy
american
healthcare
and
your
social
"security,"
they're
putting
it
at
"risk,"
my
administration
is
protecting
your
social
security.
remember
they
"said,"
four
years
ago
in
the
debates
and
you
had
this
crazy
woman.
i
"mean,"
i
hate
to
mention
her
name.
i
did
it
you
"know,"
yesterday.
i
threw
all
the
"runs,"
hates
it.
she's
a
zero.
it's
got
zero
television
personality.
aero
ab
"stoddard,"
whoever
that
is.
she
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
lost
all
of
his
"debates.\""
i
won
every
debate
and
"maybe,"
i
don't
know
maybe
one
"somebody,"
but
i
won
with
tremendous
numbers.
he
"says,"
"\"you"
always
"won.\""
i'm
not
sure.
we
"try,"
i'll
tell
you
that
and
we're
winning
now.
but
this
crazy
woman
who's
got
zero
"going,"
zero.
she
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
lost
his
debates
that
he
"won.\""
you
"know,"
she
was
talking
about
how
badly
benny
mike
did.
so
she
"said,"
"\"well,"
donald
"trump.\""
"no,"
i
won
every
single
debate.
i
won
them
against
crooked
hillary.
i
won
them
in
the
primaries
like
15
or
16
debates.
and
for
some
"reason,"
you
"know,"
sometimes
you
do
"say,"
it's
not
a
big
deal.
nobody
watches
it.
nobody
cares.
nobody
even
knows
who
she
is.
i
just
made
her
"famous,"
right?
she's
nothing.
she's
nothing.
she's
got
no
"talent,"
got
nothing.
she's
probably
got
a
little
drive.
that's
how
she
keeps
getting
on
television.
other
people
don't
have
her
drive.
but
you
know
what?
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
really
"unfair.\""
so
i
took
out
the
"polls,"
time
"magazine,"
"drudge,"
good
"guy,"
"drudge,"
drudge.
we
took
out
a
lot
of
different
things
and
we
put
up
the
drudge
"poll,"
the
time
magazine
and
many
others.
and
some
of
them
had
to
be
down
to
like
at
91%
and
they
didn't
have
many
people
and
i
can't
really
show
up
because
many
of
those
people
are
now
great
friends
of
mine.
some
of
them
are
great
republican
senators.
i'm
not
going
to
show
"results,"
but
i'm
holding
it
up
just
quickly
glancing.
i
call
it
a
glancing
"blow,"
but
we
won
the
debates
and
i
have
this
fake
news
person
"saying,"
"\"donald"
trump
did
very
poorly
in
the
"debates.\""
i
want
every
debate
easily.
i
never
did
it
before.
remember
my
first
question?
i
"said,"
"\"rosie"
"o'donnell.\""
that
was
one
of
my
best
answers.
rosie
o'donnell
who
violated
the
campaign
finance
laws
as
badly
as
anybody
i've
ever
seen
and
nothing
happens
to
her.
right?
and
yet
‘jevich
violate
…
he
made
a
little
mistake
and
they
want
to
destroy
him.
so
we
pardoned
him.
we
pardoned
him.
by
the
"way,"
he
made
a
mistake.
rosie
o'donnell.
that
was
a
massive
violation
of
the
campaign
finance
laws
but
"dinesh,"
"dinesh,"
they
wanted
to
put
him
in
jail.
i
don't
know.
i
think
he
might've
even
gone
to
jail
for
a
period
of
time
for
doing
something
that
was
really
very
understandable.
rosie
o'donnell.
five
times
what
she
did
is
incredible.
nothing
happens.
and
then
she
gets
on
and
"says,"
what
a
bad
guy
i
am.
i'm
not
a
bad
"guy,"
but
it's
really
a
disgrace.
you
"know,"
it's
a
disgrace.
i'm
glad
they
didn't
do
anything
with
"it,"
frankly
because
you
know
what
to
do
for
something
like
that.
but
you
know
what?
we
have
two
sets
of
justices
in
this
country.
it's
no
good.
it's
no
good.
it's
no
good.
you
know
the
thing
we're
working
on
right
now?
we're
trying
to
get
fairness
for
a
certain
person
who's
been
treated
very
unfairly.
a
man
who
had
a
"juror,"
who
was
a
radical
anti-trump
"person,"
and
she
didn't
say
that
when
she
went
up
there
and
she
became
the
foreperson
of
the
jury
and
she
did
terrible
things
and
said
terrible
things.
and
you
know
how
they
caught
her.
when
he
was
convicted
and
then
a
statement
was
"made,"
she
started
jumping
up
and
down
"screaming,"
"\""
"yes,"
"yes.\""
and
started
telling
everybody.
they
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
wasn't
she
just
a
"juror?\""
the
woman
was
totally
biased.
how
do
you
do
this?
so
i
fight.
"look,"
i
fight.
a
lot
of
times
it's
not
worth
"it,"
but
i
got
to
fight
for
fairness.
i
got
to
fight
for
fairness.
got
to
fight
for
fairness.
it's
a
very
unfair
system.
i
guess
it's
called
the
swamp.
when
i
said
drain
the
"swamp,"
it
was
a
nice
phrase.
i
never
liked
the
phrase.
when
i
was
"campaigning,"
somehow
the
phrase
came
"up,"
"\"sir,"
i
think
we
have
a
"phrase,"
drain
the
"swamp.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
like
it.
that's
too
"hokey.\""
but
one
day
i
was
in
a
big
"arena,"
"25,000"
people
packed
before
the
election
and
i
"said,"
"\"and"
we
will
drain
the
"swamp.\""
the
place
went
crazy.
i
"said,"
"\"wow,"
you
never
know.
you
never
"know.\""
frank
sinatra
said
his
best
song.
i
won't
tell
you
which
one
because
i'll
ruin
it
for
"you,"
but
his
best
song
is
the
song
that
he
thought
would
never
make
"it,"
the
song
that
he
liked
the
"least,"
but
he
said
that's
the
one
that
was
the
most
successful
that
the
people
like
you
never
know.
so
i
"said,"
"\"drain"
the
"swamp.\""
and
the
people
went
crazy.
i
"said,"
"\"woah.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
try
that
"again.\""
and
the
next
time
i
did
it
again
and
again
and
again.
i
only
didn't
know
how
disgusting
and
dirty
the
swamp
is
and
a
lot
of
the
media
is
a
big
part
of
the
swamp.
so
my
administration
is
protecting
your
social
"security,"
your
"medicare,"
and
is
fighting
to
give
you
great
healthcare.
we're
defending
your
right
to
keep
your
doctor
and
your
plan.
we're
defending
that
right.
you're
going
to
have
that
right
back.
we're
going
to
cancel
that
obamacare
if
we
could
win
the
case
and
we're
going
to
give
you
great
healthcare
and
we're
making
healthcare
better
and
much
cheaper
while
premiums
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
five
years
before
i
took
office.
we're
managing
it
very
well.
we
got
rid
of
the
individual
"mandate,"
by
far
the
most
unpopular
thing
where
you
had
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
for
the
privilege
of
not
having
to
pay
for
bad
"healthcare,"
right?
we
got
rid
of
it.
and
it
was
upheld
in
the
supreme
"court,"
what
we
did.
whenever
we
get
"sued,"
everything
we
"do,"
if
we
"move,"
if
we
take
10
steps
right
or
"left,"
we
get
sued
and
we're
now
offering
plans
that
are
up
to
60%
less
expensive.
we're
going
to
make
healthcare
a
big
part
of
this
campaign.
we're
protecting
people
with
preexisting
conditions
and
we
always
will.
that's
why
if
we
are
"successful,"
you
don't
want
the
supreme
court
to
try
and
get
rid
of
"this,"
the
caucus.
it's
a
caucus
known
as
"obamacare,"
but
we're
running
it
much
better
than
they
did.
remember
when
they
"had,"
this
was
the
"greatest,"
the
$5
billion
"website,"
right?
5
billion.
it
was
supposed
to
cost
5
million.
i
have
a
son
at
home.
he's
13.
he's
a
genius
with
computers.
"\"hi,"
dad.
what's
up?
dead
dad.
get
out
of
"here.\""
hey
listen.
i'm
the
president
of
the
united
"states,"
pal.
don't
talk
to
your
dad.
"\"dad,"
come
on
dad.
can't
you
see
i'm
playing
with
my
"computer?\""
the
guy
talks
to
me
and
he's
working
with
his
computer.
these
guys
are
genius.
you
"know,"
they
grow
up
with
like
"walking,"
right?
but
he's
looking
at
me.
i
could
have
given
him
their
healthcare
site.
he
would
have
done
it
for
nothing
and
it
would
have
been
better
than
what
they
have.
so
"remember,"
come
"on,"
dad.
i'm
"busy,"
dad.
what
do
you
want?
what
do
you
"want,"
dad?
"barron,"
woah.
"wow,"
he's
going
to
like
that.
he's
a
good
boy.
he's
a
tall
boy.
i'll
tell
you
that.
just
turned
13.
he's
up
there.
i'm
"saying,"
"\"hi"
barron.
how
are
you
"doing?\""
but
they're
great
with
the
computers.
they
spent
5
billion.
okay.
it
was
going
to
cost
50.
it
was
going
to
cost
five.
it
was
going
to
cost
50.
then
it
was
going
to
..
what
was
the
final
number?
five
hundreds.
the
number
that
they
"spent,"
$5
billion.
right?
it
still
doesn't
work.
they
spent
$5
billion.
right?
and
they
spent
$500
million
on
all
of
the
problems
it
caused
and
we've
really
straightened
it
"out,"
but
it's
still
lousy
"healthcare,"
obamacare.
and
it's
really
not
obamacare
anymore
because
when
you
get
rid
of
the
individual
"mandate,"
it's
no
longer
obamacare
but
we're
going
to
terminate
it.
we're
going
to
give
you
your
preexisting
a
hundred
per-
otherwise
i
won't
do
it.
we're
going
to
give
you
brand
new
preexisting
and
we're
going
to
have
a
great
healthcare
that's
much
less
expensive.
and
we're
fighting
to
stop
surprise
medical
bill
and
barron's
is
going
to
be
very
happy.
i
signed
an
executive
order
imposing
price
transparency
because
when
providers
are
required
to
show
their
"prices,"
those
same
prices
fall
very
fast.
you
"know,"
a
man
that
does
this
very
professionally
is
"great,"
into
the
healthcare
business
and
you
have
to
be
careful
when
you
say
"it,"
but
you
know
it
was
just
a
very
strong
statement.
but
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
price
transparency
in
hospitals.
where
you
can
bid
it
out
and
you
can
look
at
the
prices.
right
now
you
can't
see.
if
you
go
to
a
"hospital,"
they
won't
even
tell
you
how
much
it's
going
to
cost.
they
operate
and
then
they'll
give
you
a
bill
and
you'll
"say,"
"\"oh"
my
"god,"
i
had
no
idea
it
could
"be.\""
they
take
blood.
we
have
one
"person,"
blood
$39.
another
"place,"
the
exact
same
"thing,"
$2500.
take
"blood,"
a
blood
test.
one
is
$39
"one,"
is
$2500.
the
same
test.
maybe
the
$39
test
is
better.
who
the
hell
knows?
but
it's
crazy.
price
transparency
and
he
looks
at
me.
he
"goes,"
and
he's
a
real
pro.
one
of
the
top
in
the
country.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,\""
and
nobody
wanted
to
do
it
because
it's
a
little
bit
controversial
and
a
lot
of
the
drug
companies
don't
exactly
love
it.
the
hospitals
don't
love
"it,"
but
i
got
to
do
what's
right
for
you.
the
"people,"
i
don't
"care,"
i'm
not.
i
got
to
do
it.
but
he
looked
at
me.
and
this
is
why
i
did
it.
it
was
one
phrase.
you
"know,"
do
you
ever
do
where
you're
not
going
to
do
something?
and
then
somebody
hits
you
with
a
perfect
phrase.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
price
transparency
is
bigger
than
"healthcare.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
mean
by
"that?\""
he
"said,"
"\"you"
will
see
numbers
that
far
outweigh
"healthcare,"
"hospitals,"
"doctors.\""
he
"said,"
"\"you'll"
be
able
to
price
out
everything.
you'll
be
able
to
see
"costs.\""
he
"said,"
"\"price"
"transparency.\""
you
"know,"
people
you've
heard
about
this
for
"15,"
20
years.
no
president
has
the
guts
to
do
it.
probably
means
i
won't
get
campaign
contributions
from
certain
"people,"
but
i'm
not
going
to
get
them
anyway.
what
the
hell
difference
does
that
make?
i
don't
want
them.
i
don't
want
them.
i
got
to
do
what's
right.
you
"know,"
we're
here
for
a
short
period
of
time.
even
if
it's
a
long
"period,"
it's
still
a
short
period
and
we've
got
to
do
so.
price
transparency
is
a
big
deal.
he
said
it's
bigger
than
healthcare.
think
of
that.
bigger
than
healthcare.
so
let's
see
what
happens.
but
that'll
kick
in.
"unfortunately,"
that
kicks
in
after
the
election
because
we're
going
through
the
final
stages.
we
going
through
a
statutory
"process,"
unfortunately.
so
think
of
"it,"
we're
going
to
win.
but
let's
say
the
fake
news
could
give
me
enough
phony
"stories,"
enough
bad
stuff
that
we
don't
make
it.
the
new
president
will
get
all
the
credit
for
price
transparency
and
he
won't
even
know
what
the
hell
it
is.
and
i
took
the
heat.
isn't
that
something?
but
we're
going
to
win.
we
got
to
win
for
that
reason
alone.
we've
approved
a
record
number
of
affordable
new
generic
"drugs,"
which
are
just
as
good
as
the
name
brand
"drugs,"
but
a
fraction
of
the
cost.
and
that
was
another
one.
tremendous
political
pressure.
think
of
it.
you
own
bayer
aspirin.
you
own
all
these
name
name
brand
drugs
that
are
making
so
much
money.
and
then
the
guy
comes
along
"said,"
"\"i"
want
to
make
20
forms
of
"aspirin.\""
they're
exactly
the
same.
exactly.
but
they
don't
have
a
big
name
on
it.
exactly
as
good.
i
don't
say
better.
i
don't
say
worse.
they're
exactly
the
same.
you
"know,"
people
"still,"

it's

stupid.
"no,"
it's
true.
they're
exactly
the

we're
approving
so
many
of
the
generic
"drugs,"
a
record
number.
nobody's
ever
approved
so
much.
the

companies
hate

happened

what
we're
doing.
we
also
took
down
the

from
12
years
down
to
five
or
six
years.
they'd
have
a
new

the
thing
was
obsolete
by
the
time
it
got
approved.
we've
passed
a
really
spectacular
thing
that
they've
been
trying
to
get
for
40
some
odd
years.

to
try.
so
you
don't
have
to
now
go

you
"get,"
hopefully
nobody
in
this
room
has
those
kind
of
problems.
right
to
try.
and
so
now
you
go
and
you
sign
a
waiver
and
you
get
everything.
it's
great.
if
you're
terminally
ill.
if
you're
"very,"
very
"sick,"
you're
not
going
to
make
it.
and
you
know
why
they
didn't
do
it?
they
wouldn't
approve
it
because
they
didn't
want
to
be
sued.
and
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
this
could
be
"dangerous.\""
they
"said,"
"\"the"
people
are
terminally
"ill,"
they're
going
to

them
use

don't
wait
because
they
have
another
four
or
five
years
before
they
can
come
onto
the
"market.\""
and
it
turned
out
we
are
having
such
unbelievable
results.
and
you
know
what
else?
some
of
those
drug
companies
are
now
like
it.
that
they
fought
me
like
crazy
because
it's
really
showing
if
it
works
"there,"
it's
really
showing
that
it
works.
it's
pretty
amazing.

to

this
is

"something,"

all
of
the
radical

have
declared

you'd
have
about
three
people
standing

i
asked

term
abortion

republicans
believe
that
every

blatant
"corruption,"
and
the
total
obliteration

he's
dropping

bring

you'll
see

just

seeing

we
haven't
seen
those

ever

we've
never
seen
them.
and
by
the

we
have

we
have
record
everything.
you're
going
to
have
an
incredible
economic
year
next
year.
your
stocks
are
going
up.
your
401s
are
through
the
roof.
i
had
a
little
pause
today.
people
wanted
to
take
some
profits
and
probably
somebody
said
something
stupid
along
the
way.
but
the
stock
market's
at
record
levels.
think
of
it.
in
the
hopefully
rounding
the
turn
on
the
"pandemic,"
we're
rounding
that
"turn,"
and
vaccines
are
coming
along

the
job
that
they've
"done,"

"else,"
we're
years
ahead

anybody
else's

you
wouldn't
be
talking
about
vaccines
for
two
or
three
years
from
now.
i'll
tell
you
right
now.
that
i
can
tell
you.
biden
will
never
be
able
to
protect
your

or
your

he
is
a
puppet
of
the
"socialists,"
"marxists,"
and
the
cop
hating
extremists.
and
they
are
cop
hating.
and
we
love
our
law
enforcement.
we
love
our
law
enforcement.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
don't
know
if
you
saw
"this,"
if
there's
any
way
of
you
seeing
"it,"
we
have
thousands
of
people
behind
this
"hangar,"
"thousands,"
and
we're
trying
to
get
them
in.
and
i'd
love
to
get
them
in.
i
"mean,"
it's
an
airport.
let
them
go
to
the
runways.
okay?
let
them
in.
i
"mean,"
literally
"there,"
we
landed.
i
actually
thought
that
was
the
crowd.
we're
doing
the
hanger
thing
now
because
the
arenas
can't
do
it
because
of
the
pandemic
for
a
"while,"
a
little
while.
but
in
certain
"ways,"
i
like
this
better.
i
don't
have
to
travel.
i
get
off
the
plane.
i
make
a
speech.
i
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
"no,"
these
are
great.
do
you
remember
the
last
days
before
the
campaign?
i'd
do
a
lot
of
them
a
day.
get
off
that
plane.
it
was
a
little
different
plane.
it
was
black
and
white
instead
of
the
blue
and
white.
but
we
had
some
time.
and
that
was
an
important
day
and
that
was
an
important
"year,"
2016.
but
i
will
tell
"you,"
the
election
that
we
have
coming
up
is
the
single
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
this
country.
and
we
had
a
level
of
"enthusiasm,"
i
"mean,"
even
look
today.
with
all
going
"on,"
look
at
the
kind
of
crowds
we
have.
but
we
had
record
enthusiasm
in
2016.
by
the
"way,"
was
that
greatest
evening
ever?
november.
and
now
it's
going
to
be
november
"3rd,"
and
we'll
keep
it
going
and
we'll
get
it
all
like
a
tree.
you
move
that
tree.
it
takes
a
little
while
to
"plant,"
your
tax
cuts.
they're
going
to
raise
your
taxes.
they're
going
to
take
away
your
guns.
"really,"
if
you
look.
and
you
"know,"
they'll
criticize
me
for
saying
"this,"
the
fake
news
"media,"
which
is
back
"there,"
with
their
fake
polls.
the
same
as
last
year.
we
could
just
put
it
all
on
tape.
the
fake
"polls,"
the
fake
everything.
you
"know,"
they're
called
suppression
polls.
they're
meant
to
make
you
depressed.
are
you
depressed?
you
don't
look
depressed.
we
have
the
real
numbers.
we're
leading
everywhere.
we
are
leading
everywhere.
i'll
tell
you.
i
think
we're
way
ahead
of
what
we
were
four
years
"ago,"
and
there's
far
more
enthusiasm.
our
base
is
bigger.
it's
stronger.
and
we've
done
the
greatest
job.
"again,"
if
we
didn't
get
hit
by
the
plague
from
"china,"
between
"us,"
i
would
have
"canceled,"
mr.
"congressman,"
most
of
the
rallies.
i
wouldn't
have
needed
a
rally.
that's
a
little
bit
"unfair,"
but
that's
okay.
that's
what
china's
done
to
our
nation.
they've
screwed
us
for
a
long
time
on
a
lot
of
different
ways.
never
has
anybody
ripped
off
our
nation
like
"china,"
and
i've
taken
in
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
we
never
took
in
25
cents
from
china.
and
i
gave
$28
"billion,"
"right,"
$28
billion
to
the
farmers
because
they
were
targeted
unfairly
by
china.
and
our
farmers
are
very
unhappy.
i
don't
think
we
have
too
many
farmers
in
this
wonderful
pennsylvania
town.
i
know
we
have
a
lot
of
boilermakers
over
there.
we
got
a
lot
of
"boilermakers,"
i'll
be
talking
about
them.
look
at
those
guys.
nobody
going
to
mess
with
them.
i'll
tell
you.
we're
going
to
be
talking
about
them
in
a
minute.
but
for
the
entire
"summer,"
biden
was
silent
as
far
left
rioters
viciously
attacked
law
enforcement
in
democrat
run
cities
"all,"
burned
down
"businesses,"
terrorized
"civilians,"
and
just
recently
marched
through
the
streets
"chanting,"
"\"death"
to
"america.\""
this
is
what
we
have.
death
to
america.
and
by
the
"way,"
we
could
end
it
like
immediately.
you
saw
what
we
did
in
wisconsin.
it
ended.
it
took
a
while
for
the
governor.
you
"know,"
they
have
to
ask
us
in.
it's
"like,"
otherwise
we
have
to
do
something
much
bigger
and
it's
totally
unnecessary.
the
national
guard
is
fantastic.
i
went
to
see
them
two
days
ago.
biden
went
there
today.
there
was
nobody
there.
there
was
nobody
there.
he
was
a
little
late.
i
was
going
to
"say,"
"\"hey,"
"listen,"
we
ended
that
"problem.\""
but
we
could
end
it
in
portland.
wise
guys
in
portland.
anarchists.
they're
agitators.
they're
looters.
i'll
tell
you
we
could
end
it
in
portland
in
a
half
an
hour.
we
did
it
in
seattle.
we
told
them
we're
coming
in.
you
either
end
it
or
were
coming
in.
"congressman,"
we
were
going
in
the
next
day.
we
were
all
set.
i
was
actually
"disappointed,"
to
be
honest.
they
ended
it
in
seattle.
they
took
over
20%
of
the
city.
do
you
believe
this?
and
the
mayor
"said,"
"\"no,"
it's
going
to
be
a
summer
of
"love.\""
these
people
are
crazy.
so
we
end
them
very
quickly.
we
end
them
very
quickly.
and
now
what
we're
doing
is
we're
holding
back
funds
for
cities
that
don't
know
what
they're
"doing,"
where
they
allow
crime
to
run
rampant.
and
we
put
a
10
year
prison
sentence
at
anybody
that
knocks
down
a
statue.
i
took
out
an
old
"ordinance,"
a
very
old
"one,"
because
today
in
"congress,"
you
don't
get
things
like
that
today.
they
think
that
you
should
just
have
no
cash
bail.
they
do
the
no
cash
bail.
you
kill
somebody.
there's
no
bail.
don't
worry
about
it.
go
out.
but
i
took
out
an
old
ordinance.
i
gave
a
new
executive
order.
it
says
10
years
in
prison.
and
"amazingly,"
"amazingly,"
that
was
three
and
a
half
months
ago.
and
they
were
having
a
big
march
on
"washington,"
march
"elsewhere,"
and
"amazingly,"
that
was
the
end
of
the
statues
coming
down.
no
statutes.
and
we're
actually
prosecuting
people
for
having
done
it.
we
made
it
retroactive
to
the
beginning.
terrible.
terrible.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
state
statues
and
"monuments,"
they
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
it's
real
easy.
but
the
rioters
that
want
biden
to
"win,"
they
want
him
to
win
because
their
"agenda,"
it's
what
they
want.
it's
the
craziest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
they
both
want
to
cut
funding
for
police.
they
want
to
end
that
cash
bail.
they
want
to
hire
far
left
prosecutors
and
"judges,"
and
let
the
criminals
run
wild.
the
radical
left
district
attorney
in
"portland,"
mike
"schmidt,"
his
name
"is,"
has
released
hundreds
of
rioters
that
announced
that
anyone
arrested
for
interfering
with
police
"officers,"
disorderly
"conduct,"
criminal
"trespass,"
"rioting,"
and
other
offenses
will
not
be
prosecuted
under
any
circumstance.
"oh,"
it's
worse.
it's
worse.
you
have
somebody
in
philadelphia
who's
"worse,"
right?
worse.
in
his
manifesto
with
bernie
"sanders,"
that's
what
it
"is,"
biden
agreed
to
all
these
things.
you
notice
"now,"
"\"no,"
no.
i
never
said
about
fracking.
i
never
"said.\""
if
you
don't
do
fracking
in
"pennsylvania,"
"900,000"
jobs
and
your
energy
bills
will
triple.
other
than
"that,"
i
don't
think
you
should
have
it.
okay?
"no,"
but
he
said
in
the
"manifesto,"
plus
he
said
many
"times,"
we
put
on
the
clip
yesterday
where
"he,"
no
"fracking,"
no
"this,"
no
"that,"
i
"mean,"
no
guns.
how
about
guns?
no
guns.
no
second
amendment.
biden
has
pledged
to
a
point
prosecutors
who
extend
these
insane
far
left
policies
nationwide.
that's
what
he's
done.
that's
called
the
manifesto.
he
agreed
to
all
this
stuff.
the
craziest
"thing,"
you're
supposed
to
bring
it
to
the
right.
he
actually
brought
it
further
left.
bernie
never
dreamt
that
this
was
"possible,"
crazy
bernie.
do
you
know
crazy
bernie?
i
had
a
lot
of
his
voters
come
to
me
four
years
"ago,"
a
big
percentage.
you
know
why?
because
i
agree
with
him
and
he
agrees
with
me
on
one
"thing,"
trade.
the
trade.
because
he
knew
that
other
countries
are
ripping
us
off
and
so
did
i.
nobody
else
got
it.
especially
biden
never
got
it.
he
never
got
it.
still
doesn't
get
it.
now
he
really
gets
nothing.
i
tell
you.
he
didn't
get
it
in
prime
time.
now
he
really
doesn't
get
it.
but
it's
okay
for
them
to
make
every
city
look
just
like
portland
which
is
a
disaster.
and
"again,"
we
could
clean
it
up.
we
just
go
right
through
it.
"5,000,"
"10,000,"
right
through
it.
these
guys
are
tough.
they're
smart.
and
they
love
our
country.
they
love
our
country.
we'll
clean
it
up
in
one
half
hour.
it'll
be
over.
""
strength.
they
don't
understand.
nice.
they
chased
him
out
of
his
home.
unbelievable.
biden's
plan
is
to
appease
the
domestic
terrorist.
and
my
plan
is
to
arrest
them
and
prosecute
them.
and
i
will
always
defend
law
abiding
citizens.
that's
why
the
rioters
are
voting
for
biden
and
the
law
enforcement
"people,"
you
"know,"
we
have
it
from
everybody.
we
just
got
the
sheriffs
in
"florida,"
all
of
"them,"
all
of
them.
we
got
ohio.
we
got
texas.
we
got
north
carolina.
we
got
south
carolina.
we
got
everybody.
i
see
rick
perry
right
there.
rick
"perry,"
what
are
you
doing
"here,"
rick?
rick
"perry,"
one
of
the
greats.
but
they're
all
voting
for
me.
this
election
is
about
safety
and
this
election
is
about
jobs.
"today,"
i'm
delighted
to
accept
a
"very,"
very
special
endorsement
from
people
i
like.
sort
of
grew
up
with
these
people.
i
don't
know
what
it
"is,"
the
relationship
we
have
with
all
of
"us,"
with
all
of
us.
what
i'm
"endorsing,"
i'm
getting
an
endorsement
tonight
from
some
"very,"
very
special
people.
they
work
hard.
they
do
great.
we
really
put
them
back
to
work
because
this
state
was
in
trouble.
at
last
"year,"
you
had
the
single
greatest
economic
year
in
the
history
of
your
whole
"operation,"
right?
of
your
whole
operation.
you've
never
had
anything
like
that.
this
has
been
your
greatest.
this
has
been
prior
to
the
plague
coming
in.
it's
been
the
commonwealth's
greatest.
can
we
ever
call
the
commonwealth
a
state?
you
have
two
places.
but
you
always
have
to
"say,"
"well,"
wait
a
minute.
is
this
one
a
commonwealth?
two
places.
you
know
what
the
other
place
is?
name
it.
huh?
that's
right.
how
did
you
know
"that,"
congressmen?
huh?
but
this
"commonwealth,"
it's
a
great
commonwealth.
it's
a
great
place.
and
the
"boilermakers,"
local
"union,"
it's
local
154
of
the
boilermakers.
they
chartered
in
pittsburgh
125
years
ago.
none
of
you
were
around
to
see
"it,"
and
it
now
represents
members
in
"pennsylvania,"
"ohio,"
and
west
virginia.
and
i
want
to
thank
john
hughes
and
the
boilermakers
here
today.
it's
a
great
honor
to
have
you.
where's
john?
where
the
hell
is
john?
stand
"up,"
john.
"john,"
we
appreciate
it.
we
appreciate
it.
do
you
know
why
john
is
the
head?
you
know
why?
because
"look,"
he's
got
the
worst
location.
i
"say,"
"\"where's"
"john?\""
i'm
looking
in
the
front
row.
put
up
your
"hand,"
john.
look
at
that
guy.
he's
great.
you've
got
my
"vote,"
john.
"hey,"
"boilermakers,"
thank
you.
what
a
job
you
do.
you're
the
heart
of
this
country.
you
really
are.
thank
you
very
much.
that's
a
great
endorsement.
that's
a
great
endorsement.
joe
biden
spent
the
last
47
years
shipping
pennsylvania
jobs
to
china
and
foreign
nations.
and
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
bringing
them
back
home
and
we're
bringing
them
back
home.
bringing
a
lot
of
things
back
home.
i
ended
the
last
administration's
eight
year
pure
war
on
pennsylvania
"oil,"
and
"coal,"
and
fracking.
if
you
look
at
the
natural
"gas,"
what
they've
done
to
this
"state,"
what
they
were
doing
to
this
state.
it
was
sort
of
easy.
i
just
opened
it
up
and
i
"said,"
"\"do"
"it.\""
and
the
investment
put
into
"pennsylvania,"
the
investment
put
into
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
has
been
record
setting.
but
"again,"
you
had
the
greatest
year
you've
ever
had
last
year
prior
to
the
virus.
you're
going
to
be
set.
now
with
what
we're
"doing,"
i
believe
that
this
next
"quarter,"
which
will
be
"announced,"
"interestingly,"
just
prior
to
the
"election,"
so
i'm
putting
myself
on
the
"line,"
but
i
know
what's
going
to
happen.
the
numbers
are
going
to
be
great.
and
next
year
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
years
not
only
for
"pennsylvania,"
but
for
the
entire
country.
so
joe
"hiden,"
we
have
a
new
"one,"
joe
hiden.
we
call
him
joe
hiden.
i
have
all.
what
do
you
like
better?
what
do
you
like
better?
we
got
a
number.
let's
do
a
little
poll.
can
we
do
a
poll?
i
saved
myself
so
much
money.
you
"know,"
i
saved
myself
so
much
money.
we
do
these
polls
with
"thousands,"
and
those
people
are
coming
in
from
the
"back,"
are
they
not?
yes?
they're
coming
in.
i'm
telling
you
wouldn't
have
believed
it.
i'm
landing.
i
wasn't
waving
at
you.
i
was
waving
at
them.
there's
more.
but
i
do
these
polls.
right?
and
it's
like
a
perfect
poll.
do
you
ever
see
the
companies?
you
give
them
a
million
bucks
and
they
do
a
"poll,"
like
78
people
were
polled.
now
you've
got
thousands
of
people.
so
tell
me.
what's
your
"feeling,"
first
of
all
in
the
name
you
like
"maga,"
make
america
great
again?
yes?
"oh,"
you
are
the
one.
you
are
a
man.
i
made
you
famous
today.
you
said
the
nicest
things
about
me.
thank
you.
did
you
see
him
on
television
today?
i
think
you're
great.
i
think
you're
great.
thank
you.
"no,"
he
called
me
a
great
christian
and
a
great
christian
leader.
thank
you.
but
he
did
say
i
wasn't
"perfect,"
but
that's
okay.
i
said
thank
"you,"
anyway.
right?
"no,"
that
was
really
great.
that
was
really
great.
biden-
no
that
was
really
great.
that
was
really
great.
but
if
you
look
at
"it,"
the
things
they've
"done,"
we're
going
to
go
through
a
couple
of
different
polls
as
we
go
along
because
i
love
the
people
saying
do
this
or
do
that.
but
one
of
the
things
i
got
you
out
of
is
this
thing
sounds
so
good
but
it's
so
bad.
it's
a
rip
off
of
our
country.
the
so-called
paris
climate
accord.
it's
a
"disaster,"
a
death
sentence.
it's
a
death
sentence
for
your
energy
jobs.
i
took
it
out.
i
withdrew
from
that
calamity.
biden
pledged
to
reinstate
it.
it's
going
to
cost
you
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
you
know
what
it
really
is?
it's
a
way
of
really
taking
advantage
of
the
united
states.
this
is
what
it
is.
last
year
i
visited
the
shell
petrochemical
plant
in
beaver
county.
anybody
ever
hear
of
beaver
county?
the
largest
investment
in
your
state's
"history,"
all
made
possible
by
our
pro-energy
policies.
biden
would
wipe
out
that
entire
industry
killing
the
jobs
of
more
than
"600,000"
pennsylvania
workers.
it's
probably
"940,000"
they
say.
think
of
that.
"also,"
prices
and
everything
else.
now
biden
today
came
out
and
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
fracking's
"okay,"
it's
okay?
did
you
see
that?
fracking's
okay.
because
he
was
getting
killed.
and
now
we
came
out
in
favor
of
law
enforcement.
look
at
all
these
handsome
cops
here.
and
a
beautiful
cop.
if
you
would
see
how
"beautiful,"
if
you
would
see
how
beautiful
this
"is,"
it
was
like
this
perfect
"evening,"
the
sun
was
"setting,"
the
faces
of
these
"great,"
great
majestic
heroes
of
our
"country,"
right?
heroes
of
our
country.
and
they
want
to
blow
mount
rushmore.
but
how
about
this
one?
the
democrats
yesterday
came
out
with
a
plan.
did
you
see
it?
"now,"
they're
the
dc
democrats.
they
want
to
change
the
name
of
the
washington
"monument,"
perhaps
take
it
down.
thomas
"jefferson,"
pretty
good
thomas
"jefferson,"
right?
you
could
forget
about
ever
hearing
that
name
again.
abraham
"lincoln,"
you
could
forget
about
it.
they
want
to
take
down
all
"statues,"
all
monuments
in
washington.
we
have
some
of
your
greatest
people
right
here.
let
me
not
even
talk
to
the
congressmen.
the
heck
with
the
"congressman,"
the
boiler
makers.
how
do
you
like?
how
do
you
like
the
idea
of
taking
down
our
statues
to
our
great
george
"washington,"
thomas
"jefferson,"
abraham
"lincoln,"
andrew
"jackson,"
all
of
them?
i
don't
think
the
boiler
makers.
you'll
do
a
ring
around
washington
right?
along
with
christopher
columbus.
he's
in
big
trouble
i'll
tell
you.
except
there
was
"one,"
there
was
a
group
of
great
italians
in
new
"york,"
they
tried
to
take
down.
they
tried
to
take
down
christopher
columbus
statue
in
new
york.
you
saw
what
"happened,"
right?
these
italians
formed
a
little
circle.
they
"said,"
"\"come"
"on.\""
the
agitators
decided
to
leave.
"\"let's"
get
out
of
here
"darling.\""
they
protected
christopher
columbus.
the
"italians,"
now
the
italians
aren't
big
on
taking
down
christopher
columbus.
you
take
down
those
statues
you
can
forget
about
the
italian
vote.
do
we
agree?
but
they
protected
it.
when
asked
at
the
debate
if
there
would
be
any
place
for
fossil
"fuels,"
including
"coal,"
and
"fracking,"
and
natural
"gas,"
and
so
many
things
that
really
fire
up
these
big
plants
where
many
of
you
"work,"
and
they
produce
just
millions
and
millions
of
jobs
throughout
our
"country,"
biden
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
would
absolutely
not
allow
anything
like
that.
we
would
make
sure
it's
totally
"eliminated.\""
that's
what
he
said.
he
"said,"
"\"we"
would
make
sure
it's
totally
eliminated
or
"eliminated.\""
now
he's
coming
and
"saying,"
"\"this"
isn't
working
too
well.
this
isn't
"working.\""
and
i
made
a
speech
a
week
ago
in
texas.
we
had
crowds
that
were
"unbelievable,"
on
the
"highways,"
you
can't
get
"in,"
but
the
"highways,"
it's
like
incredible.
you
could
sell
your
ticket
tonight
for
a
lot
of
"money,"
go
to
ebay.
even
as
a
used
"ticket,"
you
could
probably
sell.
but
you
go
down
the
highways
and
you
see
"it,"
and
i
was
thinking
of
"texas,"
i'm
making
a
speech
in
front
of
obviously
people
that
like
"oil,"
they
like
"god,"
and
you
know
what
else
they
"like,"
they
like
their
second
"amendment,"
right?
so
think
about
it.
so
whether
it's
"pennsylvania,"
or
"texas,"
or
"oklahoma,"
or
north
"dakota,"
or
any
"place,"
you
take
a
look
at
"this,"
right?
and
no
"oil,"
no
"guns,"
no
god.
i
don't
think
george
washington
running
with
abraham
lincoln
as
his
"vp,"
he'll
pick
abraham
lincoln
as
vp
is
going
to
win
in
"texas,"
or
in
"pennsylvania,"
or
any
place
else
with
those
three
things
eliminated.
that's
what
they
want
to
do.
they
want
to
take
away
your
second
amendment.
if
i
weren't
"president,"
you
would
either
have
an
obliterated
second
amendment
or
it
would
be
gone
entirely.
i
am
standing
between
them
and
your
second
amendment.
and
that's
it.
that's
it.
they
know.
we
put
baido
in
charge
of
guns.
baido
is
in
"charge,"
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
everything.
"baido,"
that's
a
beauty.
remember
he
"said,"
"\"i"
was
born
for
"this.\""
anybody
that
says
they're
born
for
this.
remember
baido?
he
was
on
the
cover
of
a
"magazine,"
i
won't
mention
the
"magazine,"
they're
back
there.
it's
a
total
phony
magazine.
but
he
was
on
the
cover
of
the
magazine.
and
he
"said,"
"\"i"
was
born
to
run
for
"president.\""
he
was
born
for
it.
i
was
born.
anybody
that
gets
that
character.
that
was
when
he
was
doing
well.
since
then
he's
cratered.
ever
since
he
made
that
"statement,"
he's
looked
very
bad.
but
take
a
look
at
what
he
says
about
"guns,"
and
he
got
put
in
charge
of
guns.
so
i
guess
biden
pretty
soon
he's
going
to
be
coming
out
"saying,"
"\"no,"
no.
i
never
said
"that.\""
check
out
all
of
the
statements
he's
made
on
everything
and
now
he's
going
the
opposite
"way,"
but
he's
agreed
to
the
manifesto
entirely
so
maybe
he'll
do
that.
and
then
he
figures
later
"on,"
he'll
go.
but
everything
he
said
is
"right,"
because
he
has
no
control
over
what's
happening.
the
radical
left
has
captured
the
party.
they
even
elected
a
person
that
nobody
ever
heard
"of,"
a
"senator,"
it's
been
a
"while,"
against
a
"young,"
good
looking
kennedy
by
10
points
in
massachusetts.
did
you
know
kennedy
lost
in
massachusetts?
you
know
why?
because
he
wasn't
a
radical
left.
he
was
like
a
semi-normal
"person,"
just
slightly
left.
"no,"
but
think
of
it.
this
is
what's
happened.
and
this
is
really
what's
happened.
if
you're
not
a
radical
"lefty,"
meaning
"guns,"
meaning
fossil
"fuels,"
they
want
"wind,"
wind.
to
make
the
"windmill,"
which
are
made
mostly
in
"china,"
and
in
"germany,"
by
the
"way,"
to
make
"it,"
so
much
emission
is
let
"out,"
that
is
more
than
you
can
ever
save.
it's
just
the
craziest
thing.
"also,"
i
am
truly
an
"environmentalist,"
but
you
have
to
understand.
when
we
do
things
and
they
"don't,"
and
we
"clean,"
and
it's
very
expensive
to
do
that
and
they
"don't,"
and
we
have
this
massive
"planet,"
and
"china,"
"india,"
"russia,"
"germany,"
all
these
"places,"
it's
fuming
up
and
we're
doing
our
job
and
beautiful.
"no,"
they
have
to
do
it
also.
"otherwise,"
it
just
doesn't
work
the
way
it's
supposed
to.
they
want
to
ban
straws.
has
anybody
ever
tried
those
paper
straws?
they
are
not
working
too
good.
right?
they
want
to
ban
"straws,"
i
"said,"
"well,"
i've
had
a
couple
of
meals
at
"mcdonald's,"
et
cetera
over
the
"years,"
right?
"wendy's,"
a
friend
of
mine
owns
"wendy's,"
i'll
give
it
a
"plug,"
right?
burger
king.
so
they
want
to
ban
straws.
i
"said,"
"\"oh"
really?
what
about
the
carton?
what
about
the
plate?
what
about
the
knives
and
the
spoons
that
are
"plastic?\""
"oh,"
they're
"okay,"
but
the
straws
we
got
ban.
has
anybody
ever
"tried,"
"seriously,"
the
new
"straw,"
it's
made
out
of
"paper,"
right?
it
disintegrates
as
you
drink
and
if
you
have
a
nice
tie
like
this
"tie,"
this
would
have
no
chance.
by
the
time
you
get
"finished,"
the
straw
is
totally
disintegrated.
does
anybody
walk
around
with
a
plastic
straw?
because
it's
that
bad.
you
whip
it
"out,"
"boom,"
boom.
you
never
had
to
do
that.
when
asked
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
destroy
the
jobs
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
blue
collar
workers
to
push
his
anti-energy
"agenda,"
you
know
what
the
answer
"is,"
right?
it's
the
green
new
"deal,"
right?
this
green
new
deal.
this
was
made
up
by
people
that
don't
get
it.
either
that
or
people
that
just
don't
like
our
country
very
much.
but
biden
replied
"yes,"
he'll
get
rid
of
those
jobs.
and
he
famously
told
a
"voter,"
"\"i"
want
you
to
look
in
my
"eyes,\""
when
he's
not
wearing
the
mask
because
i've
never
seen
a
man
that
liked
their
mask.
"look,"
i'm
all
for
"it,"
we
have
a
big
"weekend,"
distance
on
the
"weekend,"
and
all
of
that
"stuff,"
and
wear
your
mask
when
you're
close
together
in
"particular,"
and
wash
your
"hands,"
all
those
things.
we
have
labor
day
weekend
coming
up.
but
did
you
ever
see
a
man
that
likes
a
mask
as
much
as
him?
and
then
he
makes
a
speech
and
he
always
has
"it,"
not
"always,"
but
a
lot
of
times
he
has
it
hanging
down.
because
you
know
what?
it
gives
him
a
feeling
of
security.
if
i
were
a
"psychiatrist,"
right?
i'd
"say,"
"\"this"
guy's
got
some
big
"issues.\""
hanging
down.
hanging
down.
"congressman,"
give
me
your
mask.
i
want
to
have
it
hanging
from
my
ear.
i
don't
want
to
touch
your
damn
mask.
mike
i'll
never
touch
your
mask.
"no,"
but
the
new
one
"is,"
i
went
for
a
"physical,"
the
doctor
said
to
"me,"
"\"sir"
would
you
like
to
go
over
to
walter
reed?
it's
"incredible.\""
by
the
"way,"
the
job
they
do
on
people
that
have
been
just
really
"hurt,"
our
heroes.
the
job
they
do
is
incredible.
"\"sir"
would
you
like
to
go
over
and
do
a
physical?
you
have
some
"time.\""
you
know
why
i
had
time?
some
"deal,"
"oh,"
it
was
china.
i
decided
not
to
see
china
because
i
didn't
like
the
way
they
were
doing
"business,"
okay?
does
that
make
sense?
so
the
"doctor,"
white
house
"doctor,"
highly
"respected,"
"sean,"
sean
"conley,"
"\"sir"
would
you
like
to
go
over
and
do
your
"physical,"
or
do
a
piece
of
"it,"
or
finish
"it?\""
or
whatever
it
"was,"
but
do
a
physic.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know.
i'm
not
in
love
with
the
"idea.\""
"\"well,"
if
you
do
"it,"
you
don't
have
to
"do…\""
"\"okay."
let's
go.
come
"on.\""
so
we
"went,"
we
"went,"
and
we're
driving.
now
you
have
to
"understand,"
they're
like
a
hundred
cars.
you
see
what
happens
here.
it's
like
the
plane
times
50.
so
the
cars
are
driving
all
over
to
about
a
20
minute
drive
and
we
get
to
the
"hospital,"
i
get
out.
i
was
there
probably
for
an
hour
and
a
"half,"
two
hours.
and
then
yesterday
i
read
that
i
had
strokes.
"cnn,"
fake
news
cnn
right
there.
"no,"
it's
true.
mini
strokes
they
called
them.
i
don't
know
what
a
mini
stroke
"is,"
but
it's
not
good.
and
there
could
be
a
day
and
i'll
"admit,"
i
said
"\"hey,"
it
happens
all
of
"us.\""
right?
except
these
young
ones.
it's
never
going
to
happen
to
them.
and
i'd
look
at
it
at
"that,"
but
you
know
what
happens?
but
nothing
happened.
so
i
went
"in,"
i
did
that
part
of
the
physical.
the
end
result
was
he's
very
healthy.
they
were
very
unhappy
when
they
heard
that
result.
what
you
don't
remember
is
when
this
took
"place,"
it
was
a
long
time
ago.
they
just
started
up
because
they
want
to
try
and
get
me
to
be
in
biden's
physical
level.
they
view
me
as
being
somebody
"that's,"
i
go
"around,"
"hey,"
last
"week,"
this
"week,"
"texas,"
north
"carolina,"
"florida,"
south
"carolina,"
back
to
washington.
let's
go
"here,"
let's
go
"there,"
let's
go
everywhere.
meetings
all
the
time.
i
think
i've
answered
more
questions
from
these
maniacs
than
any
president
in
history.
and
mean
questions.
i
watched
biden
"yesterday,"
so
he
hasn't
answered
questions
in
"what,"
two
months
or
something.
and
yesterday
he
took
a
couple
and
they
were
set
ups
like
i've
never
seen.
one
young
woman
who
i
think
is
"there,"
one
young
woman
is
"smiling,"
"\"hi,"
"hi,"
"hi,"
hi.
i
just
like
to
ask
"you,"
i'm
sorry
to
bother
you
with
this
"question.\""
it's
the
most
incredible.
so
the
doctor
wrote
a
letter
"saying,"
"\"no,"
this
rumor
is
"wrong.\""
and
i
don't
"like,"
rumors
like
that.
and
by
the
"way,"
if
it
were
a
"fact,"
it's
"fine,"
it
should.
i
think
it's
an
important
thing.
but
if
it's
not
"true,"
my
wife
was
"like,"
she
came
to
"me,"
she
"said,"
"\"i"
think
i
would
have
known
"that.\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
i
think
they
would
have
known
it
"too,"
because
they
drove
back
with
"me.\""
the
press
follows
"me,"
they
have
a
special
"deal,"
and
then
they
followed
me
and
then
we
go
"in,"
we
go
out.
but
if
you
"remember,"
last
"time,"
i
go
"in,"
i
spend
a
little
"time,"
a
physical
like
we
all
have.
hopefully
you
have
them.
good
thing
to
have
i
"guess,"
as
long
as
they
give
you
a
good
answer.
if
they
give
you
a
bad
answer
don't
"bother,"
possibly
too
late.
but
i
go
"in,"
i
come
out
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
"guess,"
whatever
it
"is,"
it's
a
short
time
"later,"
i
get
into
the
"car,"
the
press
sees
me
get
into
the
car.
on
my
way
"home,"
i
get
a
call
from
my
"wife,"
the
first
lady
who's
very
popular.
do
we
like
our
first
lady?
very
"popular,"
great
"person,"
great
woman.
she
"said,"
"\"darling,"
are
you
"okay?\""
i
"go,"
"\"why"
do
you
"ask?\""
she
"said,"
"\"they're"
reporting
that
you
had
a
heart
"attack.\""
now
you
have
to
understand
i'm
driving
in
a
"car,"
which
is
about
what?
six
cars
in
front
of
the
"press,"
because
they
have
a
big
car.
they're
a
lot
of
them
and
we
try
and
give
them
as
little
room
as
"possible,"
make
it
uncomfortable.
but
they're
right
behind
me.
so
they
know
i
got
in
and
cnn
reported
that
i
had
a
heart
attack.
that
was
the
same
"visit,"
and
that
didn't
work.
no
it's
unbelievable.
cnn
reported
i
had
a
heart
attack
so
my
wife
was
concerned.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
not
that
i
know
of.
and
if
i
"did,"
i
think
i'd
be
back
there.
no.
i'll
be
home
in
15
"minutes,"
darling.
thank
you
for
"caring.\""
it's
always
nice.
it's
always
nice.
she
sounded
relieved.
that's
good.
when
your
wife
sounds
relieved.
but
she
"said,"
"\""
i
wonder
how
that
happened.
why
did
they
do
"that?\""
because
they're
fake
news.
so
i
go
in
and
that
rumor
lasted
for
a
little
"while,"
like
a
day
or
two.
it
lasted
for
a
little
"while,"
no
matter
what
i
did.
i'm
in
the
same
"motorcade,"
i
go
"in,"
and
i
go
out.
they
know
i'm
in
the
"motorcade,"
i
actually
have
to
report
"it,"
but
i'm
in
the
"motorcade,"
and
they
said
i
had
a…
one
of
them
said
it
was
a
massive
heart
attack.
think
of
it.
"again,"
it
could
happen
"someday,"
okay?
and
when
it
"does,"
i
hope
things
work
out.
but
they
knew
i'm
in
the
motorcade
and
yet
they
reported
it
anyway
because
they
fake
news.
now
for
the
same
"visit,"
that
was
the
stupidest
thing.
from
now
"on,"
when
i
go
for
a
physical
or
something
or
go
to
the
"hospital,"
announce
it
because
this
was
a
quick
thing.
the
"doctor,"
he
got
me
in
a
lot
of
trouble.
he's
a
great
doctor.
i
"said,"
"\"no"
more
surprise
visits
to
the
hospital
where
we
do
a
little
work
because
we
have
some
"time.\""
so
now
the
same
visit
they
started
yesterday
because
some
joker
from
the
new
york
times
who's
a
third
grade
reporter
writes
a
book
and
he
"said,"
"\"the"
vice
president
was
prepared
to
take
over
the
reins
because
they
thought
the
president
was
going
to
"go,\""
i
"guess,"
under
anesthesia.
do
they
still
call
it…?
in
the
old
days
they
called
it
anesthesia.
it's
essentially
the
same
thing.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
situation
like
where
biden
used
a
record
player.
remember
that?
you
go
"home,"
you
turn
on
your
record
player.
but
the
anesthesia.
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
could
that
"be?\""
so
"remember,"
this
is
the
same
"visit,"
same
visit.
they
said
heart
attack
a
long
time.
all
of
a
sudden
out
of
this
book.
and
he
"said,"
"\"suffered"
mini
"strokes.\""
now
they
get
a
letter
from
the
white
house
doctor
that
said
it's
totally
"false,"
totally
false.
but
they
still
go
with
"it,"
they
go
with
it.
and
they
know
i'm
in
the
group
with
them
coming
back.
and
i
don't
know
much
about
a
mini
"stroke,"
but
i
assume
mr.
"congressman,"
if
you
have
a
mini
"stroke,"
you're
not
heading
back
to
the
white
"house,"
right?
at
least
you'll
spend
a
couple
of
nights
at
that
great
"hospital,"
right?
so
"anyway,"
these
are
really
dangerous
people.
they
are
so
bad
for
our
country.
if
we
had
honest
"press,"
it
would
be
so
great
for
the
usa.
it
would
be
so
great.
they're
just
a
bunch
of
phony
people.
not
all
of
them.
you
have
some
very
good
"ones,"
like
about
10%.
"no,"
you
have
some
very
good
"ones,"
you
have
some
great
"journalists,"
they
know
it's
phony
stuff.
they're
doing
anything
they
can
to
get
this
sleepy
guy
into
the
white
house
and
i
just
don't
think
the
public
is
going
to
fall
for
it.
i
don't
think
the
public
is
going
to
fall
for
it.
in
his
best
"days,"
"25,"
30
years
"ago,"
he
was
weak.
he
was
weak.
as
a
"senator,"
he
was
weak.
he
was
not
known
as
being
one
of
the
smart
ones
and
now
it's
not
exactly
"primetime,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
i
just
want
to
announce
tonight
because
we're
joined
with
some
"very,"
very
special
warriors
and
dan
"meuser,"
"dan,"
thank
you
very
much.
great
job
you're
doing.
"dan,"
congressman.
he's
a
congressman
who
have
really
been
warriors
for
me.
you
really
have
been.
thank
you
very
much
dan.
fred
"keller,"

thank
"you,"
john.
guy
reschenthaler.

you
know
him?
guy
reschenthaler.
what
are
you
doing
over
there?
what
happened?
you
don't
get
along
with
these
guys?
"oh,"
okay.
that's
good.
now
i
understand.
that's
good.
glenn
thompson.
great
"job,"
great
job
"glenn,"
really
great.
and
a
real
good
friend
of
"mine,"
right
from
the
"beginning,"
"right,"
mike?
we
were
in
pennsylvania
and
a
friend
of
"ours,"
a
"congressman,"
"longterm,"
right?
from
kentucky.
"no,"
from
actually
tennessee
came
up
to
"us,"
i
was
getting
ready
to
make
a
"speech,"
and
tennessee
is
very
early
voting.
remember
what
he
said?
this
was
four
years
ago.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know
what's
happening
in
pennsylvania.
i
don't
know
what's
happening
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
but
if
what's
going
on
in
the
rest
of
the
country
is
like
what's
going
on
in
"tennessee?\""
he
"said,"
"\"they're"
coming
from
the
"hills,"
the
"roadsides,"
the
"rivers.\""
he
said
they're
"coming,"
people
that
never
really
cared
to
"vote,"
they're
great
"americans,"
but
they
never
wanted
to
vote
for
the
people
that
they
were
seeing.
he
"said,"
"\"they're"
miles
long.
they've
got
trump
"here,"
trump
"hats,"
trump
"pins,\""
right?
tennessee.
"duncan,"
congressman
"duncan,"
right?
remember
that
mike?
that
was
the
first
time.
i
"mean,"
they
said
that
they'd
never
seen
anything
like
it.
tennessee
has
been
incredible
by
the
way.
so
mike
and
i
listened
and
we
"said,"
"\"i"
wonder
what
that's
all
"about.\""
but
it
is
true.
people
that
weren't
really
political
"people,"
they're
coming
"in,"
and
the
deal
"here,"
like
the
miss
"universe,"
good
old
miss
"universe,"
right?
like
"this,"
they
came
with
"hats,"
they
came
with
"pins,"
they're
loaded
with
pins.
one
person
had
hundreds
of
pins.
they
never
would've
had
a
pin
in
their
"life,"
but
they
love
the
job
that
we've
done
and
we're
going
to
do
it
even
better
in
the
next
four
years.
another
great
friend
of
mine
who's
a
tough
cookie
and
a
great
congressman.
but
unfortunately
he's
a
former
because
he's
"just,"
i
don't
"know.,"
he's
just
a
special
guy
and
really
has
a
"big,"
beautiful
"heart,"
lou
"barletta,"
lou.
you
look
good
lou.
why
don't
you
run
again
lou?
and
a
man
who
is
tough.
there's
this
guy.
you
ever
hear
of
a
guy
named
conor
lamb?
he's
like
a
lamb.
so
we
"heard,"
because
he's
in
sort
of
a
trumpy
"area,"
right?
and
we
heard
that
he's
going
to
be
for
"trump,"
but
he's
going
to
be
fighting
for
trump.
i
saw
some
of
his
"commercials,"
i
thought
he
was
a
"republican,"
right?
except
when
he
got
to
"washington,"
he
voted
with
pelosi
a
hundred
percent
of
the
time.
craziness.
he
voted
with
craziness.
and
so
we
"thought,"
this
conor
lamb
"guy,"
he
even
voted
to
impeach
your
president
over
nothing.
zero.
zero.
and
that's
very
personal.
when
they
do
"that,"
that's
personal.
and
i
have
to
say
"congressmen,"
196
to
nothing
they
stuck
with
us
and
so
did
the
senate
other
than
romney.
you
can
have
romney
i
think.
remember
he
was
walking
with
the
black
lives
matter
"saying,"
"\"yes,"
i'm
a
member
of
black
lives
"matter.\""
everyone
"said,"
"\"that's"
nice.
"wonderful.\""
he
had
a
lot
of
mask
"on,"
i'll
tell
you
that.
but
we
did
a
great
"job,"
it
was
an
amazing
thing.
but
this
conor
lamb
was
out
there
fighting
"it,"
and
he
shouldn't
have
done
that.
and
we
have
somebody
that
blows
him
away.
he's
more
of
a
"hero,"
he's
"tougher,"
he's
"stronger,"
he's
"smarter,"
he's
better
"looking,"
not
"that,"
that
matters.
under
the
me
too
"generation,"
i
don't
talk
about
looks
anymore.
looks
don't
matter.
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
don't
talk
about
looks.
me
too.
me
too
generation.
but
i'll
tell
"you,"
this
man
is
something
special.
he's
a
real
"hero,"
a
real
tough
"guy,"
and
he'll
never
let
you
"down,"
sean
parnell.
just
remember
that
conor
"lamb,"
and
i
"remember,"
because
he's
like
a
"lamb,"
he's
like
a
little
lamb.
"weak,"
got
a
lot
of
weak
people.
we
like
strong
"people,"
don't
we?
we
like
strong
people.
we
need
strong
people
right
now.
we
have
somebody
else
in
the
audience
who
served
as
my
secretary
of
energy
and
he
was
incredible.
he
was
the
governor
of
texas
for
what?
12
years
i
think.
rick
right?
12?
tell
me.
14?
14
years
he
was.
and
he
was
an
incredible
"governor,"
and
he
was
an
incredible
"secretary,"
and
he's
been
an
incredible
friend.
rick
perry
everybody.
there
was
nobody
that
got
into
the
race
tougher
than
rick.
what
he
said
about
"me,"
i'll
never
repeat
again.
even
my
own
family
didn't
like
me
when
he
got
finished.
and
when
he
decided
that
i
would
be
the
"one,"
he
got
out
and
there's
nobody
that's
said
better
things
about
me.
but
you're
great
"rick,"
and
you
did
a
fantastic
job.
every
place
you've
"been,"
you've
been
great.
thank
you
very
much.
rick
perry.
thank
you.
hey
"rick,"
how
are
we
doing
in
texas?
"00,"
the
polls
closed
and
they
only
announce
if
you're
way
ahead.
so
they
"say,"
"\"the"
polls
have
closed
in
the
great
state
of
"texas,"
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
"texas.\""
…
hillary
even
beat
this
guy.
hillary.
hillary
came
in
second
in
utah.
this
week
my
administration
reached
a
breakthrough
agreement
to
stop
additional
steel
imports
from
brazil
and
from
mexico
for
the
rest
of
the
year
despite
the
"usmca,"
sometimes
they
get
a
little
carried
away
and
we
have
to
do
a
little
tariff
action
on
them.
so
we
stopped
that.
we're
reversing
decades
of
the
biden
betrayals
that
decimated
pennsylvania
"jobs,"
you
know
that.
this
state
"lost,"
listen
to
"this,"
one
in
three
manufacturing
jobs
after
the
twin
disasters
of
nafta
and
china's
entrance
into
the
world
trade
"organizations,"
one
of
the
worst
things
that
"happened,"
when
china
came
in.
they
were
flat-lined
for
many
"years,"
then
they
came
into
this
crazy
deal.
they're
considered
a
developing
"nation,"
you
see
i've
been
sort
of
protesting
that
"like,"
but
they're
considering
china
as
a
developing
"nation,"
you
get
all
sorts
of
things
that
you
would
never
"get,"
advantages
over
the
united
states.
well
we
have
very
strongly
protested
that.
they're
not
a
developing
"nation,"
they're
a
very
powerful
developed
"nation,"
and
you
know
what?
they
got
to
pay
what
everyone
else
has
to
pay.
earlier
this
year
i
kept
my
promise
to
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
when
we
ended
the
nafta
nightmare
and
signed
the
brand
new
u.s.-mexico-canada
agreement
into
law
which
is
in
effect
now
and
really
doing
well.
everyone
said
it
will
never
"happen,"
and
i
had
great
help
from
these
gentlemen
right
here.
i
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
"pillaging,"
plundering
and
rampant
theft
of
pennsylvania
and
many
other
"places,"
jobs.
that's
all
throughout
the
world
by
the
way
but
our
states
have
been
just
pillaged
by
china
and
others.
joe
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
"china,"
my
agenda
is
made
in
america.
after
years
and
years
of
rebuilding
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
"country,"
it's
called
america
first.
we're
america
"first,"
that's
"enough,"
and
we're
bringing
our
soldiers
back
home.
you
see
what's
going
on.
after
19
years
in
"afghanistan,"
far
away
"places,"
to
bring
hope
to
our
inner
"cities,"
i
created
opportunity
"zones,"
tim
"scott,"
great
senator
from
south
carolina
worked
on
it
with
me.
passed
criminal
justice
"reform,"
delivered
permanent
funding
for
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
that
obama
would
never
do
and
before
the
china
virus
we
achieved
the
lowest
"african-american,"
"hispanic-american,"
asian-american
unemployment
rates
ever
recorded
by
far.
and
they're
now
heading
back
in
that
direction
quickly.
democrat
politicians
have
failed
the
black
community
for
"decades,"
they've
failed
the
asian
"community,"
the
hispanic
community.
they
failed
women.
the
numbers
on
women's
unemployment
were
the
best
in
61
years.
biden
spent
the
last
47
years
betraying
the
american
people.
he
was
always
for
things
that
you
wouldn't
want
and
now
he's
"changing,"
"\"no,"
i
never
said
that.
i
never
said
"that.\""
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
keeping
my
promises
and
delivering
for
the
african-american
community
and
for
all
communities
and
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
perhaps
in
no
area
have
our
opponents
more
thoroughly
betrayed
working
families
of
all
backgrounds
and
on
the
subject
of
"immigration,"
we've
been
fighting
for
that.
under
my
administration
we
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
we
ended
catch
and
"release,"
stopped
asylum
"fraud,"
and
we've
deported
"20,000"
gang
members
and
we
get
them
out
and
we
get
them
out
fast.
thank
you
ice.
ice
and
border
patrol.
ice
and
border
patrol.
they
don't
like
ice
because
ice
"is,"
they're
tough.
you
got
to
be
tough
in
that
job
by
the
way.
anybody
up
here
like
to
work
in
ice?
i
don't
think
so.
let's
"see,"
you
could
probably
be
okay
but
you'd
rather
do
what
you're
"doing,"
right?
i
agree
with
you.
these
are
tough
"guys,"
they
have
to
be
tough.
these
are
"bad,"
bad
gang
members.
i
mean
you
look
at
"ms-13,"
you
look
at
what's
happened
with
"ms-13,"
you
look
at
…
we
get
them
the
hell
out.
sometimes
we
have
to
put
them
in
prison
because
we
don't
even
want
to
take
a
"chance,"
they
can
come
back
in
after
what
they've
"done,"
we
had
"thieves,"
we
had
some
very
bad
people
in
the
va
and
they're
all
gone.
thank
"you,"
i
love
you
"too,"
thank
you.
thank
you.
such
friendly
voices.
quite
beautiful.
only
in
"pennsylvania,"
right?
thank
you.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
think
of
this.
obama
paid
$150
billion
for
a
short-term
deal.
he
gave
$1.8
billion
in
cash.
you
ever
see
a
million
dollars
like
at
a
casino
floor
or
something
in
$100
bills?
it's
a
"lot,"
it's
like
the
size
of
"this,"
right?
now
think
$1.8
billion.
how
did
you
guys
allow
that
to
happen?
they
said
we
all
voted
against
it.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel.
you
never
know
"nowadays,"
right?
and
i
opened
the
u.s.
embassy
in
jerusalem.
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
they've
been
trying
to
get
that
done
for
52
"years,"
i
got
it
done
immediately.
by
the
"way,"
as
far
as
the
capital
of
"israel,"
"jerusalem,"
they've
been
talking
about
"many,"
many
presidents.
they
all
promised
"it,"
nobody
did
it.
i
did
it.
we
get
things
"done,"
and
we
just
did
something
that
is
incredible.
even
the
new
york
times
gave
it
good
"reviews,"
not
good
"reviews,"
beyond
good
reviews.
tom
friedman
gave
it
phenomenal
"reviews,"
you
believe
that?
that's
we
achieved
the
first
breakthrough
in
middle
east
peace
in
"decades,"
a
deal
with
israel
and
the
uae.
it's
a
deal
with
israel
and
the
uae
and
that's
going
to
lead
and
i'm
going
to
tell
you
we
have
representatives
over
right
now
and
other
people
are
saying
we
want
to
get
in
that
deal.
you'll
have
peace
in
the
middle
east.
we
want
to
get
the
hell
out.
let's
get
them
all
back.
let's
get
thel
all
back.
don't
"forget,"
we're
energy
independent.
there
used
to
be
a
reason.
now
we
do
have
a
"reason,"
it's
called
"israel,"
and
we
have
some
very
good
partnerships
over
there.
in
all
fairness
we
have
some
countries
that
have
treated
us
very
well
and
we're
going
to
take
care
of
those
"countries,"
but
we
are
energy
independent
for
the
first
time
and
that's
a
very
good
feeling.
our
military
has
never
been
stronger
than
it
is
now.
it's
new
and
it's
beautiful
and
i
told
you
we
took
over
100%
of
the
isis
caliphate
in
iraq
and
syria
and
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
isis
"al-baghdadi,"
and
"separately,"
we
killed
the
world's
number
one
"terrorist,"
number
one
terrorist
for
decades
and
"decades,"
qasem
soleimani.
we
killed
soleimani.
it's
a
big
step
for
the
middle
east.
we
kept
america
out
of
wars.
remember
they
always
"said,"
"\"oh,"
this
trump.
he's
"radical,"
he's
"really,"
i
mean
he's
off
the
…
he's
too
radical.
he'll
get
us
in
"wars.\""
i
kept
us
out
of
"wars,"
what
happened
with
north
korea?
"look,"
i
get
along
with
kim
jong-un.
they
"say,"
"\"that's"
terrible
he
gets
"along.\""
no
it's
good
if
i
get
along.
if
i
get
along
with
"russia,"
is
that
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing?
i
think
it's
a
good
thing.
these
guys
only
fight
to
"tie,"
they
don't
fight
to
"win,"
you
fight
to
win.
you
look
at
what's
happening
where
they're
all
coming
back
home.
i
even
reduced
in
germany
because
"germany,"
they're
an
"ally,"
but
you
"know,"
they
took
advantage
of
us
very
badly
on
trade
and
very
badly
with
our
military.
so
we
removed
a
lot
of
soldiers
out
of
germany.
they're
not
"happy,"
they
"said,"
"\"this"
is
going
to
hurt
our
"economy.\""
well
it's
good
for
our
"economy,"
okay?
they
thought
it
was
going
to
hurt
the
german
economy.
"well,"
they
don't
treat
us
"right,"
they
don't
pay
their
"bills,"
they're
delinquent.
you
know
what
delinquent
is?
they're
delinquent.
they
don't
pay
their
bills.
we
protect
"them,"
they
don't
pay
their
bills.
we
got
to
do
something
and
they
treat
us
horribly
on
trade
through
the
european
union
which
basically
they
run.
together
we've
been
rapidly
fixing
a
half
a
century
of
disasters
and
biden
was
there
for
every
one
of
them.
joe
biden
supported
"nafta,"
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade.
he
supported
the
korean
"deal,"
the
korean
deal
was
so
"bad,"
it
was
so
bad.
this
was
a
deal
that
was
going
to
produce
to
south
korea
done
by
crooked
hillary
"clinton,"
this
was
a
deal
that
was
going
to
produce
"250,000"
jobs.
she
"said,"
"\""
this
will
be
"250,000,\""
and
she
was
"right,"
for
south
korea.
it
produced
"250,000"
jobs.
for
"us,"
we
got
nothing.
we
got
"losses,"
we
got
nothing.
it
was
a
terrible
"deal,"
i
"renegotiated,"
now
it's
a
good
deal.
they
also
gave
and
want
to
give
mass
amnesty
for
illegal
aliens.
biden
supported
cutting
social
security.
he
voted
for
the
iraq
"war,"
he
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
the
killing
of
"soleimani,"
when
i
did
"that,"
he
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
terrible
thing.
that's
a
terrible
"thing.\""
everybody
in
the
middle
"east,"
they
couldn't
believe
it.
they
"celebrated,"
some
of
them
quite
quietly
i
must
add.
sign
your
mail-in
ballot.
you
sign
it
and
send
it
in
and
then
you
have
to
follow
it
and
if
on
election
day
or
early
"voting,"
that
is
not
tabulated
and
"counted,"
you
go
"vote,"
and
then
if
for
some
reason
after
"that,"
it
shouldn't
take
that
"long,"
it
comes
"in,"
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
tabulate
it
because
you
will
have
voted.
but
you
have
to
make
sure
your
vote
counts
because
the
only
way
they're
going
to
beat
us
is
by
doing
that
kind
of
stuff.
i'm
trying
to
be
nice.
i'm
trying
to
be
nice.
they
want
to
send
out
congressmen
80
million
ballots.
now
there
have
been
many
races
over
the
last
year
where
they've
done
this
and
they've
been
a
disaster.
you
look
at
new
"york,"
they
had
a
congressional
"race,"
not
a
very
good
"congresswoman,"
very
"untalented,"
i
know
her
"well,"
i
lived
in
new
york.
she's
not
got
much
going.
they
have
no
idea
what
the
vote
"is,"
i
think
20%
of
the
ballots
were
missing
and
then
they
declared
her
the
winner
and
the
other
guy
"said,"
"\"what"
about
"me?\""
he's
not
too
"happy,"
her
opponent.
you
look
at
what
happened
in
"paterson,"
new
"jersey,"
you
look
at
what
happened
in
"virginia,"
you
look
at
what
happened
…
there's
not
a
"race,"
and
these
are
"small,"
these
are
easy
to
control.
they
want
to
send
out
80
million
"unsolicited,"
i
like
it
much
"better,"
they
used
to
say
"universal,"
they
used
to
say
live
"ballots,"
i
like
the
word
"unsolicited,"
and
solicited.
solicited
is
"okay,"
because
that's
when
you're
asking
and
you
want
it
and
you
send
in
the
necessary
paperwork
and
documentation
and
you
get
the
ballot
and
you
fill
it
"out,"
that's
okay.
but
you
"can't,"
this
whole
thing
with
the
"unsolicited,"
unsolicited
means
you're
sitting
there.
we
have
a
big
enthusiasm
"edge,"
but
when
they
throw
these
things
in
your
face
and
the
lists
are
inaccurate
and
people
are
dead
and
dogs
have
gotten
"ballots,"
they
have.
dogs
have
gotten
ballots
and
they
know
i'm
right
and
everybody
knows
i'm
right
and
they
say
i'm
right
behind
the
closed
doors
and
it's
a
"disgrace,"
what
they
do
to
our
country.
80
million
unsolicited
ballots.
people
that
had
no
idea.
people
that
weren't
going
to
vote
in
all
fairness.
it's
really
unfair
because
our
people
have
"enthusiasm,"
they're
going
out
to
vote.
they're
all
going
out
to
vote.
everybody
here
going
to
vote?
everybody?
they
have
no
enthusiasm.
so
i
"said,"
"\"so"
that's
unfair.
that
guy
walks
and
then
they'll
have
somebody
knock
on
the
"door,"
"say,"
"\"listen,"
i
would
like
your
"ballot.\""
"\"i"
don't
want
to
vote.
i
don't
care
about
biden.
i'm
a
democrat.
i
don't
care
about
this
"guy.\""
"\"well"
"look,"
where
is
"it?\""
"\"here"
take
"it,"
blah
blah
"blah.\"\""
they
even
have
a
provision
where
you
don't
have
to
verify
signatures.
what
is
going
on?
and
they
have
another
provision
in
some
states
where
you
can
"harvest,"
that's
where
you
grab
them
all
together
and
drop
them.
in
"nevada,"
they
actually
have
a
provision
where
they
don't
have
to
be
counted
until
seven
days
after
the
election.
so
that
means
if
we
have
a
close
"election,"
could
be
"close,"
i
hope
it's
"not,"
i
hope
we
have
a
landslide
like
you've
never
seen.
but
if
we
have
a
close
election
that
means
nevada
has
the
right
"to,"
and
i
love
"nevada,"
i
think
we're
going
to
win
"nevada,"
except
where
they're
sending
all
these
hundreds
of
"thousands,"
millions
of
unsolicited
ballots
to
people
in
nevada
and
people
that
probably
left
a
long
time
ago.
it's
very
"unfair,"
it's
very
"unfair,"
but
think
of
it.
they
have
seven
days
after
the
election.
did
you
know
that
mike?
seven
"days,"
what
does
that
mean?
i
want
to
see
the
results
of
the
election
on
november
3.
by
the
"way,"
if
it's
anything
like
these
other
"events,"
it
could
go
on
forever.
i
mean
the
congressional
race
which
they
just
gave
up
and
they
declared
her
a
winner
which
they
should
not
have
"done,"
they
should
make
that
a
do-over
and
i
think
in
paterson
they
have
a
do-over.
i
think
they're
going
to
do
it
over
because
it
was
just
ripe
with
"fraud,"
theft.
people
were
selling
"ballots,"
people
were
selling
"ballots,"
and
you
know
they
talk
about
russia.
they're
so
worried
about
russia.
what
about
sending
out
80
million
ballots?
that's
your
real
"problem,"
and
if
russia
or
china
or
these
other
countries
want
to
"cheat,"
all
they
have
to
do
is
forge
ballots.
it's
much
easier
than
the
way
they
have
to
go
about
"it,"
right?
so
we
have
to
put
pressure
on
these
people.
now
the
good
news
is
we
have
a
lot
of
court
cases
we
have
won
in
"pennsylvania,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
we
have
two
"judges,"
we
have
a
state
"judge,"
we
have
a
federal
judge.
i
think
both
highly
qualified
judges
from
what
i
"understand,"
i
hear
that
they're
not
too
happy
about
what
they're
seeing.
so
we'll
see
what
happens.
we're
going
to
see
what
happens.
the
lawyers
feel
very
confident
but
we
have
to
win
those
cases
but
what
you
have
to
do
is
send
in
your
early
ballot
and
then
go
and
make
sure
that
ballot
is
tabulated
or
"counted,"
and
if
it's
not
"counted,"
"vote,"
and
then
they
have
the
"job,"
if
it
comes
in
"late,"
and
if
it's
not
too
"late,"
they
have
the
job
of
making
sure
that
they
don't
count
it.
but
follow
that
ballot
because
these
"people,"
they'll
be
"lost,"
they'll
be
"gone,"
the
numbers
are
incredible
where
they're
25
and
30%
"off,"
20%
off.
follow
your
ballot.
when
i
banned
travel
from
"china,"
biden
called
it
hysterical
and
xenophobic.
if
we
had
listened
to
sleepy
joe
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
americans
would
have
died.
you
know
that.
you
know
he
always
gets
up
"today,"
"\"covid-19,"
"covid-19.\""
i
"say,"
"\"joe,"
look.
we
got
a
"country,\""
and
i
agree
with
that
and
we've
done
a
hell
of
a
job.
we've
done
a
hell
of
a
job.
if
you
look
at
some
of
our
numbers.
you
got
to
start
talking
about
the
economy
and
you
got
to
start
"talking,"
your
"place,"
i
mean
this
is
…
when
you
look
at
"pennsylvania,"
you're
in
a
shutdown.
you
have
a
governor
that
has
you
shut
down
we
know
the
susceptible
are
old
"people,"
senior
"citizens,"
nursing
homes.
people
that
are
"old,"
especially
if
they
have
heart
problems
or
if
they
have
diabetes.
we
know
"that,"
we
learned
"it,"
and
we
opened
it
up.
but
the
problem
these
shutdowns
are
causing
much
bigger
problems.
you
remember
my
original
"statement,"
right?
the
cure
can't
be
greater.
it
was
an
original
statement
that
a
lot
of
people
picked
up
but
it's
so
true.
you
have
to
open
up
this
"commonwealth,"
it
has
to
be
opened
up.
it
has
to
be
opened
up
now.
but
there's
what
i
think
they're
"doing,"
because
you
have
the
same
thing
in
new
york.
we
have
a
governor
in
new
york
who
is
"36,000"
people
"died,"
"11,000"
people
in
a
nursing
home
because
he
made
a
mistake.
he
made
a
horrible
"mistake,"
and
i
built
him
a
convention
center
with
"2,800"
beds
and
they
didn't
use
it
and
i
sent
up
a
"ship,"
a
great
hospital
"ship,"
a
massive
hospital
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
rooms
and
they
didn't
use
it
and
he
requested
it
and
then
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
not
using
it.
why
aren't
you
using
"it?\""
he
could
have
put
those
people
in
the
convention
center
in
the
hospital
ship.
what
a
shame
how
long
can
you
do
this
for?
"restaurant,"
poor
guys.
you
"can't,"
how
long
can
you
do
this
for?
the
people
are
going
to
lose
their
jobs.
they're
never
going
to
open
again.
it's
not
like
the
restaurants
is
the
greatest
business
in
the
world.
it's
a
hard
business.
new
york
is
closed.
you're
closed.
north
carolina's
closed.
michigan's
…
all
democrats.
let
me
tell
"you,"
what's
going
to
happen
on
november
4th.
they're
going
to
announce
their
opening.
they're
doing
this
for
political
reasons.
they
are.
"right,"
john?
they're
doing
it
for
political
reasons
because
they
want
our
numbers
to
look
as
bad
as
"possible,"
going
into
november
"3rd,"
election
day.
then
as
soon
as
the
election's
over
"with,"
"win,"
lose
or
draw
for
"them,"
they're
going
to
open
it.
they
got
nothing.
you
know
what?
it's
a
shame
what
they're
doing.
for
political
"reasons,"
they'll
be
open.
you'll
be
open
on
november
"4th,"
but
you
know
what?
from
your
"standpoint,"
it's
very
close
to
the
election.
it's
very
far
if
you
have
a
"restaurant,"
and
you
can't
open
your
restaurant.
you
can't
open
your
store.
it's
a
disgrace
and
they
ought
to
get
together.
they
ought
to
do
it.
these
are
democrat
governors
in
all
instances
and
democrat
mayors.
when
the
china
virus
"arrived,"
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
thanks
to
the
life-
saving
therapies
that
we
"pioneered,"
the
mortality
rate
has
been
reduced
by
85%
since
april.
think
of
that.
we've
achieved
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
of
any
major
"country,"
anywhere
in
the
world.
you
never
hear
that
from
the
fake
news.
they
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it.
this
is
a
big
country.
this
is
a
tougher
country
to
do
that
"with,"
the
european
union's
case
fatality
rate
is
nearly
three
times
higher
than
ours.
if
you
look
"now,"
spain
is
having
a
big
blow
up.
france
is
having
a
big
blow
up.
"now,"
we've
done
a
great
"job,"
we
haven't
been
given
credit
for
it.
he
always
starts
"off,"
covid-19.
that's
all
he
knows.
covid-19.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
the
economy?
what
about
jobs?
what
about
all
the
other
things
we
have
to
"do?\""
all
he
"does,"
he
thinks
it's
a
weak
"spot,"
and
actually
in
"theory,"
if
we're
getting
a
fair
shake
from
those
people
back
"there,"
it's
actually
what
the
job
we've
done
is
actually
a
strong
spot.
that
includes
you
"people,"
with
the
ventilators
that
nobody
had.
nobody
that
needed
a
"ventilator,"
didn't
get
a
ventilator.
now
we're
supplying
them
all
over
the
world.
"altogether,"
the
nations
of
europe
have
experienced
a
30%
greater
increase
in
excess
mortality
than
the
united
states.
think
of
that.
you
don't
hear
these
numbers.
cases
in
the
us
have
declined
by
28%
nationwide
over
the
last
"month,"
and
hospitalizations
and
deaths
have
declined
radically
over
the
last
week.
three
vaccines
are

would
have
taken
two
years
for
another
president.
i
was
going
to
say
a
normal
"president,"
but
they'll
hit
me
with
…
a
little
truth
to
that
too.
"now,"
but
for
another
"president,"
"especially,"
in
the
last
"administration,"
they
had
the
h1n1
pandemic.
it
was
called
swine
flu.
you
"know,"
joe
always
calls
it
the
n1h1.
he
gets
it
mixed
up.
"no,"
it's
the
"h1n1,"
joee.
not
that
it
"matters,"
i
guess.
no.
do
you
ever
"notice,"
he's
always
calling
it
the
other.
he
calls
it
the
opposite.
he
has
no
clue
where
he
"is,"
but
he
keeps
"saying,"
"\"oh,"
if
he
"was,\""
well
he
didn't
want
the
ban
"china,"
and
we
saved
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
by
banning
china.
i
was
the
only
one
that
wanted
to
do
"it,"
actually.
then
we
banned
europe
because
i
saw
what
was
happening
in
italy
and
spain
and
france.
we
banned
europe.
we
saved
hundreds
of
thousands.
if
i
didn't
do
the
closing
and
the
"opening,"
so
we're
at
"175,000,"
far
too
…
"look,"
one
is
too
much
because
this
was
given
to
us
by
"china,"
and
it's
a
disgrace.
it's
a
disgrace.
they
could
have
stopped
it.
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
"china,"
but
not
going
to
the
rest
of
the
"world,"
including
our
country.
it's
a
disgrace.
but
think
of
it.
joe
biden
got
the
worst
marks
you've
ever
seen
for
his
handling
of
the
h1ni
swine
flu.
they
said
it
was
"incompetent,"
and
the
head
"guy,"
who
now
he's
trying
to
retract.
it's
a
little
tough.
that's
one
great
thing
about
the
tape.
he
said
it
was
horrible.
he
"said,"
we
did
a
horrible
job.
he
"said,"
they
got
lucky.
it's
not
contagious
like
this.
we
"got,"
this
is
a
tough
one.
i
can
look
at
that
guy
and
he'll
catch
it.
right
"there,"
and
he's
very
far
away
from
me.
it's
a
tough
"one,"
because
it's
so
contagious.
i
tell
you
"what,"
our
"vice-president,"
mike
"pence,"
and
the
task
"force,"
headed
up
by
mike
and
working
along
with
a
lot
of
great
"people,"
they've
done
a
fantastic
job
and
they
just
get
no
credit.
if
i
was
a
"democrat,"
a
different
"president,"
and
they
did
the
same
"job,"
they'd
say
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
jobs
they've
ever
seen.
but
take
a
look
at
what
they
say
about
the
way
they
handled
the
swine
flu.
it
was
a
disaster.
it
was
incompetent.
they
called
themselves
incompetent.
they
"call,"
and
now
they're
coming
in
"like,"
"well,"
we
would
have
done
this
and
biden
by
the
"way,"
was
"against,"
you
"remember,"
"xenophobic,"
"racist,"
because
i
closed
down
china.
then
two
months
"later,"
two
and
a
"half,"
"three,"
and
nancy
pelosi
was
having
dances
in
"chinatown,"
right?
a
month
later.
"no,"
no
problem.
i
was
way
ahead.
then
biden
comes
out
and
he
actually
said
that
i
was
"right,"
but
they
"said,"
"\"don't"
say
"that,"
try
doing
it
a
little
softer
than
"that.\""
he
did
it
a
little
bit
"softer,"
but
we
were
right.
they
were
wrong.
they
handled
it
so
badly.
just
take
a
"look,"
because
"we,"
i
said
to
my
"people,"
"\"we've"
got
to
fight
this
a
little
bit
differently
because
we're
getting
a
lot
of
fake
"news,"
a
lot
of
bad
people
saying
"things\","
and
you
look
at
the
stats
and
you
look
at
how
we've
done
compared
to
really
much
easier
and
much
smaller
"countries,"
it's
amazing.
if
you
took
new
york
out
of
"it,"
which
was
a
disaster
by
"cuomo,"
if
you
took
new
york
out
of
those
"numbers,"
we
would
have
numbers
that
would
be
even
better
than
they
are.
i
could
read
numbers
that
would
be
even
much
"better,"
because
a
big
percentage
of
the
people
that
died
in
this
country
died
because
new
york
was
incompetently
run
by
mayor
de
blasio
and
governor
cuomo.
by
the
"way,"
just
"today,"
there's
another
credible
thing
happening.
"pfizer,"
great
"company,"
announced
that
it
expects
to
have
the
results
of
its
vaccine
trials
in
a
matter
of
"weeks,"
very
shortly.
incredible.
under
operation
warp
"speed,"
we
remain
on
track
to
produce
a
safe
and
effective
"vaccine,"
in
that
record
time
that
we
talked
about.
this
would
have
been
years
later.
it'll
be
delivered
"before,"
in
my
"opinion,"
before
the
end
of
the
"year,"
but
it
really
might
even
be
delivered
before
the
end
of
october.
how
do
you
like
that?
wouldn't
that
be
nice?
that
would
be
nice.
you
know
why?
not
because
of
the
electric.
it'll
be
nice
because
we
want
to
save
people.
that's
why
it'll
be
nice.
that's
the
important
thing.
"together,"
we
will
defeat
the
virus.
the
job
we're
doing
"is,"
the
job
that
all
of
the
people
working
on
"it,"
our
"generals,"
our
"admirals,"
the
"distribution,"
we
bought
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
of
"things,"
and
now
we
make
gowns
and
we
make
masks
and
we
make
shields
and
we
make
ventilators.
very
tough.
the
ventilator's
very
"complicated,"
very
"big,"
very
expensive.
it's
"like,"
i
made
the
"statement,"
it's
like
building
a
"car,"
but
more
sophisticated.
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
it's
"not.\""
they
"said,"
they
took
a
ventilator.
they
took
it
apart.
these
people
are
the
"worst,"
the
worst.
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we'll
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
"world,"
and
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
that's
what
we'll
do.
let
me
just
tell
you
something.
if
they
didn't
waste
a
year
and
a
half
of
my
life
on
a
ridiculous
"impeachment,"
based
on
a
phone
call
that
was
"perfect,"
this
stuff
would
have
all
been
done.
would
have
all
been
"done,"
truly.
it
would
have
all
been
done.
"yet,"
with
all
of
this
"stuff,"
the
fake
russia
witch
"hunt,"
the
fake
ukraine.
how
about
that?
did
anybody
read
the
transcript
of
that
call?
it
was
a
perfect
call.
"\"hey,"
congratulations.
good
"luck.\""
it
was
like
a
perfect
call.
now
they'll
take
it
back
and
they'll
"say,"
"\"well,"
i
don't
"know.\""
this
was
a
per
…
in
"history,"
there's
never
been
anything
like
this.
it
was
a
totally
"lopsided,"
100%
political
witch
"hunt,"
and
it
goes
on
and
on.
these
are
bad
people.
i
really
believe
they
don't
love
our
country.
i
watched
nancy
pelosi.
"\"you"
must
wear
your
mask.
you
have
to
wear
your
"mask,"
and
we're
going
to
keep
every
beauty
salon
closed
in
california
and
all
over
the
"country.\""
then
i
see
a
picture.
i
"say,"
"\"nancy"
pelosi.
"well,"
where's
the
"mask?\""
i'll
tell
you
what.
she
must
have
treated
that
beauty
salon
owner
pretty
badly.
she
uses
the
salon
and
the
salon
turned
her
in?
the
salon
turned
her
in.
i
don't
think
i
would
have
turned
her
in.
i
would've
"said,"
"\"well,"
you
"know,"
she's
a
customer.
i
got
to
take
care
of
my
"customers,"
"right?\""
but
she
made
them
"open,"
and
the
salon
turned
her
in
and
the
salon
did
business
with
her.
how
much
do
they
hate
nancy
pelosi?
then
she
made
a
terrible
mistake
because
you
want
people
that
can't
be
set
up.
she
"said,"
"\"i"
was
set
up.
i
was
set
up
by
the
salon
owner.
i
was
set
"up.\""
i
"said,"
"\"tell"
me
she
didn't
say
"that,"
"please.\""
i
just
put
"out,"
that
if
she
was
set
"up,"
then
she
shouldn't
be
leading
the
house
of
representatives.
i
want
the
salon
owner
to
lead
the
house
of
"representatives,"
because
she
set
up
…
think
of
it.
she
set
up
the
speaker
of
the
house.
that
was
a
big
mistake.
as
soon
as
i
"heard,"
she
"said,"
"\"well,"
she's
sent
me
"up,\""
"nancy,"
you're
not
supposed
to
get
set
up.
you're
representing
our
country.
you
know
what
she
should
have
done
honestly?
she
should
have
"said,"
"\"i"
made
a
"mistake,"
"sorry,\""
and
nobody
would
be
talking
"about,"
this
is
like
the
biggest
story.
this
is
the
"big,"
crazy
"nancy,"
highly
overrated
person.
let
me
just
say
she
is
a
highly
overrated
person.
they
give
her
such
good
play.
she
is
a
highly
overrated
person.
"look,"
they
just
turned
off
a
camera
because
they
don't
want
me
saying
that.
just
in
"closing,"
we
will
rapidly
return
to
full
"employment,"
soaring
wages
and
record
prosperity.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increased
penalties
for
assault
on
law
enforcement.
surge
federal
prosecutors
into
high-crime
communities
and
ban
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
and
justices
who
believe
in
enforcing
the
"law,"
not
their
own
political
agenda.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
speech
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
citizens.
we
will
not
let
them
threaten
our
"citizens,"
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
endless
foreign
wars.
we
will
end
surprise
medical
billing.
we
don't
want
surprise
medical
billing.
you
know
what
happens?
it's
"terrible,"
but
we
have
ended
it.
"also,"
we've
signed
something
that's
incredible.
you're
going
to
see.
some
people
say
it's
bigger
than
"healthcare,"
and
i
signed
it.
unfortunately
it
takes
place
on
january
1st.
you
better
elect
me.
you
better
elect
me.
it's
called
price
transparency.
i
said
to
my
people
at
the
end
of
the
"day,"
what
is
price
transparency?
this
is
going
to
lower
your
prices
by
50%.
you'll
be
able
to
negotiate.
you'll
be
able
to
do
things
you're
not
even
allowed
to
do
"now,"
with
"hospitals,"
with
doctors.
you
get
better
"doctors,"
you
get
lower
prices.
i
"said,"
"\"when"
does
it
"start?\""
it's
a
complicated
…
"oh,"
did
i
"get,"
i
was
fought.
you
have
no
idea.
right
fellows?
you
have
fought
too.
but
they
fought
me
on
this
price
transparency.
it's
bigger
than
"healthcare,"
could
be
bigger
than
healthcare.
but
i
"said,"
"\"when"
does
it
"start?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
it
all
"set.\""
"\"when?\""
"\"january"
"1st,\""
"\"i"
"said,"
i'd
better
win
this
"election,\""
because
you're
going
to
see
some
unbelievable
price
reductions.
that
includes
on
"drugs,"
because
we're
reducing
health
insurance
premiums
"massively,"
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
went
down
the
first
time
in
51
"years,"
last
year.
but
now
it's
going
to
go
down
very
"big,"
because
we
did
a
favorite
nation's
clause.
i
see
the
drug
companies
"are,"
they're
killing
me
with
ads.
they
have
nothing
but
cash.
they
have
nothing
but
money.
they're
spending
because
they
can't
believe
…
germany
and
other
countries
pay
much
less
than
we
do.
we
want
to
"have,"
what
we
have
to
"have,"
is
we
have
to
have
a
comparison
of
prices.
that's
what
it
is
"called,"
favored
nation
clause.
i
instituted
a
"favorite,"
so
we're
paying
$2.50
for
a
"pill,"
and
some
nation
is
paying
25
cents
for
the
same
exact
pill
from
the
same
"factory,"
right?
we
get
the
25
cent
price.
"so,"
what's
going
to
happen
that'll
go
up.
ours
will
come
way
down.
they
can't
believe
it.
the
drug
companies
can't
"believe,"
and
i
will
tell
"you,"
mark
meadows
is
"here,"
our
chief
of
staff.
where's
mark?
they
want
to
negotiate.
they
called.
we
signed
it.
it's
all
done.
they
want
to
negotiate
and
they
are
"negotiating,"
so
let's
see
what
"happens,"
but
we're
going
to
get
you
cuts
on
prescription
"drugs,"
the
likes
of
which
you've
never
seen.
we'll
protect
medicare
and
social
security.
they
will
not
be
able
to
protect
it.
it
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
"conditions,"
always.
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on
mars.
when
i
took
"over,"
nasa
was
dead.
now
it's
the
most
vibrant
space
center
in
the
"world,"
by
far.
we
will
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools
and
we'll
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
history
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
we
will
live
by
the
timeless
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
"god,"
we
trust.
for
"years,"
you
had
a
president
who
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
standing
up
for
the

of

by
the

they
want

i
do
this
every
night
and
a
lot
of
times
it's
a
waste.
i
did
it
last
night.
we
were
…
did
you
see
the
crowd
we
had
last
night?
we
were
in
a
great
"place,"
ohio.
we
had
a
crowd.
we
had
a
crowd.
you
couldn't
see
the
end
of
it.
i
"said,"
"\"turn"
around
"camera,"
turn
"around.\""
"but,"
they
never
liked
doing
"that,"
you
know?
they
don't
like
spinning
those
cameras.
they
don't
want
to
show
the
crowd.
they
don't
like
showing.
they
don't
like
"showing,"
show
the
crowd
and
this
is
…
it's
an
honor.
let
me
tell
you.
"look,"
i
used
to
think
that
was
a
difficulty
like
it
was
a
new
camera
that
can't
"turn,"
but
then
whenever
there
was
like
a
"problem,"
like
there'd
be
a
little
argument
or
some
kind
of
an
anti-trump
"person,"
you
don't
see
that
much.
i
don't
want
to
bring
it
"on,"
but
you
don't
see
it
much
anymore.
you
know
why?
it's
dangerous.
it's
dangerous
for
"them,"
but
you
"know,"
i'd
see
the
camera
would
never
"move,"
whenever
where
there's
something
like
a
little
negative
"happening,"
that
thing
would
turn
around
like
a
pretzel.
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
it
does
"move.\""
"but,"
they
never
want
to
show
the
crowds.
they
"never,"
last
night.
"now,"
i
went
home
and
i
tell
you
"this,"
i
go
home
all
the
time.
first
"lady,"
"\"how'd"
you
like
the
"crowd?\""
"sir,"
i
didn't
see
it.
i
didn't
see
"it,"
but
i
didn't
see
"it,"
donald.
i
didn't
see
it.
sometimes
she'll
call
me
mr.
"president,"
but
she's
only
kidding.
believe
me.
she's
only
kidding.
has
she
been
a
great
first
"lady,"
right?
she's
been
a
great
first
lady
and
very
popular.
she's
really
done
a
great
job.
she
works
hard.
we
have
some
great
people
here
tonight.
i
brought
certain
members
of
my
"family,"
but
i'm
going
to
introduce
them
to
you
in
a
little
"bit,"
okay?
great
family.
they
work
hard.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
they
work
hard.
they
really
work
hard.
but
i
do
wish
they
would
show
because
it
would
"be,"
you
"know,"
it's
actually
better
for
them
if
they
show.
it
shows
the
importance.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
show.
i'll
"say,"
"\"how"
did
it
"look?\""
i
don't
know
how
it
"looked,"
but
the
sound
was
phenomenal.
okay?
it
sounded
like
a
penn
state
football
game
like
the
steelers
football
game.
you
can't
disguise
it.
you
ever
see
sleepy
joe
with
the
little
circles?
"oh,"
you
can.
he
puts
them
very
far
"away,"
so
far
away.
then
he
comes
up
with
the
mask.
he's
like
a
hundred
yards
from
the
nearest
human
being.
he's
got
a
…
he
feels
good
about
the
mask.
i
wonder
in
the
debate
it'll
be
him
and
i
or
the
stage.
is
he
going
to
walk
in
with
a
mask?
"no,"
i
think
he'll
come
in
with
a
mask.
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
idea.
"well,"
the
question
"is,"
will
he
leave
it
on
during
the
debate?
because
it's
a
little
hard
and
i'm
all
for
mask
when
you
need
"them,"
i'm
"up,"
but
when
you're
making
a
speech
and
the
nearest
person's
like
where
you
are
and
you're
in
a
stage
all
by
yourself
and
then
he
had
a
habit
of
taking
it
off
and
it
hangs
down
on
his
ear
as
he's
"speaking,"
it
makes
him
feel
comfortable.
"honestly,"
whatever
makes
you
feel
good
is
okay
with
"me,"
but
it'll
be
interesting.
i'm
going
to
"be,"
we're
going
to
have
a
big
rating
on
that.
he's
been
doing
it
all
his
life.
he's
been
doing
it
for
47
years
and
i've
just
started
doing
this
stuff.
i'm
just
starting.
"but,"
i'm
just
"thinking,"
but
i
did
it
more
in
47
months
than
he
did
in
47
years.
that's
true.
that's
true.
you
look
at
what
we've
done.
"no,"
it's
true.
that's
actually
true.
he
did
a
lot
of
negative
stuff
too.
you
have
to
deduct
that
out.
when
asked
if
there
would
be
any
place
for
fossil
"fuels,"
including
coal
and
fracking
in
a
biden
"administration,"
joe
"replied,"
"\"no,"
we
would
make
sure
that
it's
all
"eliminated.\""
all
of
a
"sudden,"
he
gets
the
nomination.
he's
been
trying
to
get
the
nomination
for
decades.
he
finally
"get,"
and
that
was
prime
time
for
"him,"
which
was
never
great.
he
never
got
more
than
1%.
we
called
it.
"remember,"
i
called
him
his
first
nickname
was
1%
joe.
"frankly,"
had
elizabeth
warren
been
loyal
to
her
"philosophy,"
which
is
radical
"left,"
"socialism,"
perhaps
communism.
i
don't
"know,"
perhaps.
it's
verging
on
"communism,"
right?
but
had
she
been
"loyal,"
she
would've
left.
she
would
have
quit.
she
had
no
chance.
she
was
out.
pocahontas.
she
was
gone.
"remember,"
i
"said,"
"\""
i
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
you
have
and
i
have
"none.\""
i'd
love
to
have
"some,"
but
i
don't
happen
to
have
any.
then
she
choked
and
she
went
out
and
got
a
test.
she
announced
she
had
"1024th,"
right?
"1,000."
that
"means,"
like
i
said
it
last
"night,"
that
means
around
700
or
800
years
"ago,"
"somewhere,"
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
relationship
going
and
that's
okay.
"seven,"
800
years
"ago,"
maybe.
what
a
phony
she
is.
it's
terrible.
"now,"
we're
going
to
pick
a
great
"woman,"
any
one
of
the
five
that
i
told
"you,"
but
any
one
of
the
women
that
we
had
they're
all
great
"people,"
great
"scholars,"
"great,"
brilliant
people.
a
lot
of
people.
00
on
saturday
at
the
white
house.
you
"see,"
we
have
tremendous
republican
support.
two
people.
always
got
to
be
two.
always
got
to
be
the
two.
those
two.
we
have
great
support
from
the
republican
"party,"
tremendous
support.
it's
never
been
this
unified
before
"ever,"
ever
and
the
fake
impeachment.
we
had
196
to
nothing
republican
support.
we
had
52
and
a
half
to
a
half
in
the
senate.
who
is
the
half?
i
can't
imagine.
i
can't.
buddy
was
very
good
today.
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
he
was
good.
"now,"
i'm
happy.
thank
"you,"
mitt.
thank
you.
"no,"
he
was
very
"good,"
very
positive
"statement,"
but
days
"ago,"
biden
reiterated
his
pledge
to
require
net
zero
carbon
emissions.
that's
basically
"saying,"
you
know
what
that
is?
there'll
be
no
more
oil.
there'll
be
no
more
gas.
there'll
be
no
more
nothing.
there'll
be
no
more
industry.
there'll
be
no
more
country.
that's
what
it's
like
really.
that
would
instantly
shut
down
all
fracking
and
all
mining
immediately
in
pennsylvania
sending
your
jobs
"overseas,"
sending
your
money
to
somebody
"else,"
not
you.
i'll
keep
your
jobs
in
pennsylvania
where
they
belong
and
you're
going
to
be
doing
fracking
for
a
long
time.
i
can
say
the
same
because
you
are
really
big
in
energy.
i
can
say
the
same
thing
to
you
as
i
say
in
texas.
"so,"
they
don't
want
oil.
they
don't
want
"fracking,"
right?
they
don't
want
the
energy
that
we
know
that
powers
these
massive
plants
because
the
other
stuff
is
wonderful.
it's
not
going
to
do
it.
it's
not
going
to
do
it.
"so,"
they
don't
like
oil.
they
don't
like
the
gas.
they
don't
like
"god,"
"religion,"
churches
are
close.
how
about
these
states?
they
still
have
churches
closed.
by
the
"way,"
your
governor
hasn't
been
so
great.
you
know
"that,"
right?
are
your
churches
still
closed?
they're
still
closed.
they're
doing
it
for
a
reason.
by
the
"way,"
november
"4th,"
they'll
"announce,"
"\"we've"
decided
to
open
"up.\""
okay?
they're
trying
to
make
our
numbers
as
bad
as
possible.
"so,"
california's
closed.
pennsylvania's
closed.
north
carolina's
closed.
michigan
is
closed.
that's
another
beauty
right
"there,"
michigan's
closed.
then
they
have
these
fake
"ballots,"
millions
and
millions
of
ballots.
by
the
"way,"
when
not
"if,"
when
you
see
"shenanigans,"
please
report
it
to
your
authorities.
okay?
the
real
"authorities,"
they're
watching
and
the
authorities
are
"watching,"
but
please
report
it.
but
when
you
look
at
"it,"
"really,"
it's
amazing.
they're
trying
to
make
our
numbers
look
"bad,"
but
even
with
numerous
closed
states
and
you
notice
also
law
and
"order,"
right?
law
and
"order,"
the
red
"states,"
the
republican
"states,"
they're
working
great.
record
low
"crime,"
record
"low,"
but
democrat
run
"states,"
you
look
at
"chicago,"
you
look
at
new
"york,"
new
york
has
gone
through
a
…
we
have
to
bring
back.
we
should
draft
rudy
giuliani.
okay?
let's
bring
him
back.
draft
rudy.
we
want
rudy.
"rudy,"
rudy.
i'll
tell
you
rudy
is
"amazing,"
but
he
did
a
great
job.
new
york
was
in
big
trouble.
he
came
in
and
he
just
was
"tough,"
"smart,"
and
it
became
the
safest
big
city.
"now,"
we
have
a
man
where
some
categories
of
crime
were
up
300%.
he
fired
"1,000."
he
fired
a
lot
of
"police,"
i
"guess,"
a
billion
dollars
a
year
worth
of
"police,"
worth
of
great
"police,"
firemen
and
women.
it's
a
terrible
thing.
i
love
that
place
so
much
and
it's
so
sad
to
see
what's
happening
to
new
york.
we're
going
to
make
a
little
bit
of
a
play
for
new
york.
in
"theory,"
the
democrats
automatically
win
new
"york,"
but
i
do
phenomenally
in
most
parts.
then
one
"part,"
it's
"automatic,"
but
i
can't
imagine
that
particular
part
is
going
to
be
very
happy.
"so,"
we're
going
to
make
a
play
for
new
york.
with
"pennsylvania,"
i
don't
have
to
make
a
play.
we've
got
pennsylvania.
just
go
out
of
here.
we
don't
have
to
make
a
play.
we
don't
have
to.
it's
a
"great,"
you
"know,"
for
years
though
pennsylvania
was
a
place
that
republicans
just
didn't
win.
for
many
"years,"
everybody
thought
they
were
going
to
"win,"
every
republican.
so
"yeah,"
we're
going
to
win
pennsylvania.
they
thought
they
were
going
to
win
it
and
they
didn't.
i
came
along
and
we
won
it
and
we
won
it
quite
easily.
quite
easy.
i
think
we're
going
to
do
even
better
"now,"
because
"remember,"
number
one
in
the
history
of
your
state
last
"year,"
and
that's
because
of
what
we
"did,"
we
stopped
the
dumping.
we
saved
your
stell.
so
many
different
"things,"
but
pennsylvania
is
the
home
of
american
energy.
think
of
it
that
way.
this
has
taken
place
over
a
very
short
period
of
time.
"also,"
the
birthplace
of
a
thing
called
the
american
constitution.
right?
american
constitution.
to
uphold
our
constitution
as
written
as
opposed
to
as
conceived
by
some
radical
left
"judge,"
i
will
soon
be
announcing
that
nominee.
you're
going
to
love
it.
you're
going
to
be
so
happy.
if
you
don't
love
"it,"
don't
vote
for
me.
okay?
you
don't
like
it.
my
opponent
refuses
to
release
a
list
of
justices.
i
was
told
that
a
big
thing
when
i
was
running
last
"time,"
nobody
really
knew
me.
they
knew
me
very
well.
we
had
great
success
at
the
apprentice
and
in
business
and
it
was
"great,"
but
they
never
knew
what
kind
of
a
judge
i
would
pick
or
to
be
a
"justice,"
right?
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
"mean,"
what
am
i
going
to
do?
how
am
i
going
to
solve
that
"problem?\""
"but,"
i
was
in
"politics,"
never.
don't
"forget,"
when
i
"ran,"
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
he's
"inexperienced.\""
i
ran
against
some
very
talented
people.
some
of
whom
are
very
good
friends
of
mine.
some
of
whom
i
don't
like
too
much.
when
i
don't
like
"somebody,"
it
last
for
a
long
"time,"
but
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
how
do
we
solve
that
"problem?\""
i
don't
know.
they
just
weren't
believing.
the
appointment
of
a-
just
weren't
believing.
the
appointment
of
a
united
states
supreme
court
justice
was
much
more
important
to
the
voters
than
i
thought.
and
they're
"right,"
because
they
will
set
policy
for
50
years
and
they'll
set
"policy,"
whether
it's
"life,"
whether
it's
second
amendment.
the
second
"amendment,"
if
i
weren't
"president,"
you
know
the
"pressure,"
your
second
amendment
would
be
obliterated.
it
would
maybe
be
"gone,"
but
at
a
minimum
"obliterated,"
they
haven't
touched
your
second
amendment.
not
even
touched
it.
because
i'm
here
to
block.
i'm
a
blocking
force.
i'm
like
a
lineman
for
the
pittsburgh
steelers.
i'm
a
blocking
force.
"no,"
they
haven't
touched
it.
but
your
second
amendment
would
be
under
siege.
so
nobody
knew.
i
never
knew.
you
hear
about
supreme
"court,"
you
know
about
supreme
"court,"
you
know
about
other
"judges,"
by
the
way
at
the
end
of
the
first
"term,"
we'll
be
close
to
300
federal
"judges,"
including
court
of
"appeals,"
which
i
think
is
a
record.
i
guess
it's
a
record.
it's
a
lot.
that's
a
lot.
nobody's
done
that.
it's
record.
think
of
that.
300.
that's
a
big
percentage
of
the
entire
judiciary.
think
of
that.
300.
and
"many,"
many
court
of
appeals
"judges,"
but
two
great
supreme
court
judges
or
justices.
and
now
we're
going
to
get
a
third.
can
you
imagine
our
enemies?
three
in
one
term.
so
many
"presidents,"
they
just
don't
have
the
chance
and
it's
so
important.
but
i
said
to
my
"people,"
i
"said,"
so
if
they
don't
believe
"me,"
what
i'll
do
is
i'll
make
up
a
list
of
25
judges
or
people
and
we'll
tell
"them,"
"\"i"
will
only
pick
from
that
"list.\""
they
"said,"
"\"that"
sounds
like
an
interesting
"idea.\""
this
was
my
idea.
when
you've
never
run
for
office
before
you
have
to
have
a
little
bit
of
imagination.
so
i
got
out
a
"list,"
i
named
the
"people,"
the
people
are
"good,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"and"
i
promise
that
i
will
pick
someone
like
the
people
on
this
"list.\""
and
it
didn't
work.
it
went
nowhere
because
they
didn't
trust
it.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
want
you
to
pick
the
people
on
the
"list,"
not
somebody
like
the
people
on
the
"list.\""
so
i
went
back
the
next
"week,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
will
pick
somebody
that's
on
this
"list.\""
and
they
were
all
"great,"
great
judges
for
the
most
"part,"
i
think
almost
"entirely,"
but
judges
and
really
respected
conservative
believers
in
our
"country,"
"solid,"
incredible
people.
and
as
soon
as
i
did
"that,"
things
went
through
the
roof.
it
was
amazing
how
important
it
was.
by
the
"way,"
would
you
stand
up
with
that
beautiful
jacket?
i
love
this
guy.
how
many
times-
how
many
events?
he's
been
to
a
couple.
that's
really
great.
thank
you
very
much.
i've
seen
him
before.
he's
been
here
a
couple
of
"times,"
like
about
90.
thank
"you,"
man.
that's
really
nice.
i'm
going
to
get
one
of
those
jackets.
by
the
"way,"
the
wall.
the
"wall,"
"yeah,"
330
miles.
330
miles.
330
miles.
and
"yes,"
we
have
a
great
relationship
with
mexico.
first
they
"said,"
"\"he'll"
never
be
able
to
build
"it.\""
the
democrats
were
just
brutal.
i
made
a
terrible
"mistake,"
i
said
it
last
"night,"
i
should
have
"said,"
"\"we"
will
not
under
any
circumstances
build
a
wall
at
our
southern
"border.\""
they
would
have
given
me
all
the
money
in
the
world.
but
"stupidly,"
i
"said,"
"\"we"
will
build
a
"wall.\""
and
the
democrats
"said,"
"\"let's"
not
give
it
to
"him.\""
but
we
got
"it,"
we
won.
we
won
court
"cases,"
we
won
court
cases.
i
won
so
much
money
we
could
build
four
walls
if
we
wanted.
so
then
they
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
all
"right.\""
they've
lost.
so
by
the
"way,"
we're
up
to
"330,"
the
exact
wall.
their
dream
choice.
i
said
to
the
border
"patrol,"
i
love
these
"people,"
they're
"great,"
"ice,"
the
border
"patrol,"
what
they
do
is
incredible.
they're
incredible.
i
"said,"
"\"give"
me
your
dream
"wall,"
as
long
as
we're
building
we
might
as
well
build
a
wall
that
you
want.
let's
build
it
"right.\""
"\"sir,"
we
have
to
have
vision.
we
need
steel
and
"concrete.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
about
one
or
the
"other?\""
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
"sir,"
we
need
steel
and
concrete.
we
need
steel.
inside
those
poles
we
have
rebar
and
we
have
concrete
and
they're
30
feet
tall.
we
need
all
sorts
of
things.
we
need
them
to
be
"wired.\""
i
won't
tell
you
why
they're
"wired,"
but
they're
wired
for
a
reason.
they're
all
wired
up
and
they're
incredible.
but
you
know
what?
we
got
the
wall.
nobody
could
have
done
it.
so
once
we
had
the
wall
and
it
started
going
up
and
then
we
hit
a
hundred
"miles,"
200
"miles,"
now
we're
at
"330,"
and
we're
building
10
miles
a
week
and
it'll
be
finished
very
soon.
and
we
have
the
most
secure
border
in
terms
of
drug
"trafficking,"
trafficking
coming
along
and
we've
done
phenomenally
well.
because
that's
a
lot
of
the
territory
that
we
need.
we're
going
to
go
up
to
probably
a
little
bit
over
500
"miles,"
so
we're
at
330.
but
once
they
saw
that
i
had
"it,"
they
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
but
mexico's
not
paying
for
"it.\""
but
they
are
paying
for
"it,"
mexico's
paying
for
the
wall.
they
are
paying
for
it.
they're
paying
at
the
border.
they're
paying
for
the
wall.
all
those
trucks
that
go
back
and
forth.
they're
paying
for
the
wall.
so
the
democrats
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
but
"mexico…\","
they
always
have
to
find
"something,"
right?
and
do
you
remember
what
i
used
to
say
that
if
they
fight
"us,"
remember
people
would
"say,"
"\"what"
happens
if
they
fight
you
on
the
wall?
what
happens
if
they
fight
you
right
to
hell
on
the
"wall?\""
i
"said,"
"\"the"
wall
would
get
10
feet
"taller.\""
took
a
little
hit
on
"that,"
we
took
a
little
bit
of
a
"hit,"
but
that's
okay.
the
wall
is
a
tall
"sucker,"
you
don't
want
to
get
up
to
the
top.
they
look
"down,"
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
"ye,"
"ye,"
how
do
we
get
down
off
"this?\""
it's
tall
and
it's
strong
and
it's
great.
and
we
"appreciate,"
because
mexico
has
been
working
with
us
very
closely.
they
have
right
now
"27,000"
mexican
soldiers
on
our
southern
border
making
sure
that
people
don't
come
into
our
country.
i
want
to
thank
the
president
of
mexico.
very
helpful.
so
i
made
this
list
of
potential
justices
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
it
all
changed.
now
i'm
asking
sleepy
joe
biden
to
give
me
a
list
and
he
doesn't
want
to
do
it.
you
know
why?
because
he
can
only
put
super
radical
left
judges
"on,"
people
that
would
destroy
our
"country,"
people
that
would
destroy
your
country.
and
he
knows
that
he's
not
electable…
he
shouldn't
be
electable
anyway.
this
is
the
worst
candidate.
you
know
where
he
is
today?
they
have
a
thing
called
the
lid.
i
don't
even
know.
do
you
know
what
lid
stands
for?
lid.
he
put
out
a
lid
today
early
in
the
morning.
lid
means
he's
not
going
to
be
anywhere
today.
i'm
working
my
ass
"off,"
i'm
in
"ohio,"
i'm
in
"texas,"
i'm
in
"florida,"
i'm
in
"michigan,"
i'm
in
wisconsin.
man.
thank
you.
that's
so
nice.
"well,"
that
is
something
that
one
of
the
fake
news
reporters
back
"there,"
they
said
they've
never
heard
of
that
one.
"\"there"
was
a
chant
that's
going
over
the
last
six
or
seven
rallies
"saying,"
‘we
love
"you.'\""
that's
never
happened
to
a
politician
before.
am
i
a
politician?
i
don't
want
to
be
a
politician.
i
don't
think
of
myself
as
a
politician.
but
it
really
"is,"
i
appreciate
it.
i've
never
heard
it.
i
liked
ronald
"reagan,"
but
they
never
said
we
love
"you,"
or
maybe
they
did.
they're
going
to
try
and
find
out.
then
they'll
"say,"
"\"president"
trump
lied
last
night
because
40
years
ago
i
"remember…\""
but
"no,"
nobody's
ever
heard
that
one
before
and
i
appreciate
it
because
it
is
reciprocal.
thank
you
very
much.
reciprocal.
reciprocal
love.
it's
reciprocal.
i
had
such
a
nice
life
before
i
did
this.
i
had
such
a
nice
life.
then
i
had
the
witch
hunt
that
goes
on
forever.
it
goes
on.
and
then
we
catch
them
spying
on
our
campaign.
how
about
that?
let's
see
what
happens
though.
but
we
caught
them
"spying,"
all
of
"that,"
the
whole
big
deal.
and
then
the
guys
that
were
doing
the
"investigation,"
they
have
their
31
different
"phones,"
they
were
accidentally
wiped
clean.
31
different
"phones,"
i
think
it
was
like
19
different
"people,"
and
they
all
did
the
same
exact
accident.
which
if
you
knew
anything
about
"phones,"
it's
almost
an
impossibility
to
do
it
once.
let
alone
31
different
times.
so
we
caught
them
and
that's
called
obstruction.
we
have
to
remember
that's
called
obstruction.
that
was
the
mueller
group.
that
was
a
mueller
group.
all
those
"phones,"
they
were
wiped
so
clean.
and
hillary
got
a
subpoena
on
the
30.
i
"said,"
"\"forget"
about
these
things
because
you'll
find
them.
they
have
them.
they're
in
the
state
"department.\""
i
have
no
doubt
about
"it,"
they're
in
the
state
department
but
they'll
get
them.
but
you
know
what?
"33,000,"
they
have
a
request
from
the
us
"congress,"
that's
not
"bad,"
us
congress
they
send
a
"subpoena,"
"very,"
very
"important,"
and
after
getting
the
"subpoena,"
she
deleted
all
of
her
emails
and
acid
"washed,"
and
then
she
took
her
telephones.
i've
gotten
rid
of
phones
too.
i
throw
them
away.
she
took
cameras
and
she
beat
the
hell
out
of
them
with
a
hammer
and
then
threw
them
away.
and
they
found
a
couple
of
them.
she
was
very
"angry,"
"obviously,"
if
she
did
the
hammer
work.
but
if
anyone
else
said
"this,"
there's
a
"protection,"
there's
a
dual
level
of
"justice,"
but
we're
getting
down
to
the
bottom
of
it
because
it's
not
fair
to
us.
not
fair
to
us.
"33,000"
emails.
she
deleted
them
on
the
basis
that
it
was
all
about
her
daughter's
"wedding,"
"chelsea,"
and
also
yoga
classes.
"33,000"
emails
on
yoga
and
a
wedding.
i
don't
think
so.
and
comey
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
okay.
that
sounds
like
a
good
"reason.\""
that's
comey.
that's
another
beauty
right
there
that
comey.
but
we
caught
"him,"
we
caught
him.
very
smart
move.
getting
rid
of
that
guy
was
a
smart
"move,"
but
we
caught
him.
"listen,"
we
caught
him.
they
were
spying
on
the
"campaign,"
they
were
doing
actually
worse
than
that.
nobody's
ever
done
a
thing
like
"this,"
so
let's
see
what
happens.
but
we
caught
him
"cold,"
we
got
so
much
stuff.
remember
the
insurance
"policy,"
right?
from
strzok
and
"page,"
two
lovers.
they
were
very
smart.
they
would
use
the
public
servers
and
send
it
over
the
public
wires
because
they
didn't
want
to
be
caught
having
an
affair.
so
they
went
over
the
public.
that
was
a
very
good
thing
for
us.
wasn't
it?
"\""
"darling,"
"darling,"
"darling,"
please.
she's
going
to
win.
she's
going
to
"win,"
isn't
she?
"peter,"
peter
only
you
can
save
us.
"peter,"
she's
going
to
win.
"yes,"
darling.
she's
going
to
win.
i
know.
"100,000"
to
"nothing.\""
remember
that?
it
was
actually
100
million
to
one.
this
was
a
hundred
million
to
one.
this
is
this
idiot.
so
"listen,"
"\"so"
"darling,"
"please,"
please
tell
me
again.
"yes,"
100
million
to
one
she's
going
to
win.
but
just
in
case
she
"doesn't,"
we
have
an
insurance
"policy.\""
now
that
only
means
one
thing.
and
we
went
through
the
insurance
policy
and
we
caught
them.
so
let's
see
what
happens
to
these
treasonous
crooks.
these
terrible
people.
and
they
put
our
nation
through
turmoil.
but
i
just
want
to
thank…
a
lot
of
people
were
very
unfairly
treated.
you
look
at
general
"flynn,"
"look,"
he's
still
going
through
it.
can
you
believe
it?
but
a
lot
of
people
were
unfairly
treated
by
a
bunch
of
"treasonous,"
horrible
people.
and
they
used
the
intelligence
agencies
of
our
country
to
try
and
steal
an
election
and
to
try
and
do
a
coup.
wouldn't
you
think?
who
would
ever
think
this
country…
but
that's
all
you
can
say.
some
people
would
"say,"
"\"well,"
that's
a
conspiracy
"theory.\""
"no,"
just
take
a
look
at
the
records.
for
"me,"
it's
a
very
exciting
thing
because
we
found
something
that
nobody
would
have
thought
possible.
now
let's
see
what
happens.
but
we
have
them
"cold,"
they
spied
on
our
campaign.
it's
our
campaign
and
if
you
want
to
save
"america,"
you
have
to
go
"out,"
get
out
and
vote.
this
is
the
most
important
election.
in
just
three
and
a
half
years
we've
secured
america's
"borders,"
which
makes
them
very
"unhappy,"
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
us
"military,"
we
built
the
military.
it
was
totally
depleted
when
i
took
over.
we
built
a
military.
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollars
we
"spent,"
all
made
in
the
"usa,"
the
greatest
"equipment,"
the
greatest
planes
and
rockets
and
missiles
and
our
nuclear.
i
hate
to
even
mention
the
word
and
hope
to
god
we
never
have
to
use
"it,"
but
we
have
the
most
powerful
weapons
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
we
did
that
over
a
very
short
period
of
time.
weapons
that
are
so
powerful
that
we're
the
envy
of
the
"world,"
but
i
never
want
to
use
those
weapons.
and
hopefully
we'll
never
have
to.
you
know
the
way
you
don't
have
to
use
"them,"
is
when
you
have
them.
it's
when
you
have
them.
but
nobody's
ever
built
force
like
what
we
have.
and
the
newspapers
and
the
press
and
the
fake
news
they
went
and
"said,"
"\"he"
just
gave
away
classified
"information!\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
will
look
you
right
in
the
"eye,\""
first
of
"all,"
i'm
allowed
to
do
"it,"
i'm
the
"president,"
so
i'm
allowed
to
actually.
i'm
the
only
one
that's
allowed
to.
but
"no,"
"no,"
i
didn't
give
away.
i'm
just
telling
"you,"
most
powerful
weapons
ever
produced
we
"have,"
and
other
countries
know
that.
and
it's
a
good
thing
that
they
know
it
and
i
don't
think
we'll
ever
be
using
them.
and
i
hope
we
don't.
i
hope
to
god.
i
use
the
word
"god,"
because
they
refuse
to
use
the
word
god
in
their
pledge
of
"allegiance,"
right?
twice.
i
use
the
word
god.
i
hope
to
"god,"
we
never
have
to
use
them.
but
i
obliterated
the
isis
"caliphate,"
which
was
all
over
the
place.
100%.
remember
i
got
it
down
to
99%.
they
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
go
a
"hundred.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
get
out
of
here.
we're
bringing
them
all
back
home.
everyone's
coming
back
"home.\""
"long,"
long
wars.
the
never
ending
"wars,"
the
endless
wars.
we
fixed
our
disastrous
trade
"deals,"
they
were
a
"disaster,"
brought
jobs
and
factories
back
to
pennsylvania
under
16
years.
and
think
of
"this,"
for
16
years
"presidents,"
"obama,"
president
"bush,"
household
income
rose
"$2,945."
that's
over
a
16
year
period.
in
three
"years,"
your
household
income
rose
almost
"$10,000."
when
you
include
energy.
you
have
to
include
energy.
without
"energy,"
almost
"$7,000."
but
we
have
to
include
energy.
i
"mean,"
how
much
are
you
paying
for
your
gasoline?
you
never
saw
$2
gasoline.
"less,"
right?
it's
less.
they
go
"up,"
it's
less.
it's
a
big
difference.
what
is
it
nowadays?
come
"on,"
tell
me.
i
haven't
got
any
gas.
i
haven't
stopped
recently
at
a
gas
station.
15?
okay.
because
for
a
while
it
was
way
under
two.
and
we're
going
to
keep
it
there.
we
have
so
"much,"
we
have
so
much.
in
my
first
three
years
we
lifted
6.6
million
people
out
of
"poverty,"
the
largest
poverty
reduction
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
by
far.
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
right
now
we're
doing
it
again.
i
see
all
these
"hats,"
make
america
great
again.
and
now
i'm
going
to
say
"this,"
make
america
great
"again,"
again.
make
america
great
"again,"
"again,"
again.
we
saved
1.4
million
jobs
in
pennsylvania
alone
and
to
fight
the

it's
the

not
the

like
a

a
beautiful
place.
it's

"no,"
it's
the

they
don't
want
to
say
it.
the
radical
"left,"
they
don't
want
to
say
it.
you
ever
notice
they're
always
going
to
have
to
russia.
"look,"
nobody's
been
tougher
on
russia
than
me.
"\"russia,"
"russia,"
"russia.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
"china?\""
they
never
going
to
to
mention
it.
they
got
little
deals
going
on
i
think.
but
"coronavirus,"
doesn't
it
sound
like
italy?
a
beautiful
villa.
corona.
"no,"
it's
a
china
virus.
they
should
have
stopped
it.
to
fight
the
china
virus
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
we
did
an
a+
"job,"
except
we
did
a
d
job
in
terms
of
public
"relations,"
explaining
it
because
we
were
too
busy
doing
it.
but
the
fact
is
they
wouldn't
have
written
it
anyway.
it
didn't
matter
to
them.
it's
there.
it's
their
little
thing.
you
have
a
watch
biden?
he
can't
talk
about
it
he
"thinks,"
so
he
gets
"up,"
"\"the"
"coronavirus,\""
they
"say,"
"\"we"
want
to
talk
about
supreme
court
judge
"today.\""
"well,"
i
don't
know
about
that.
"\"the"
"coronavirus.\""
and
he
doesn't
know
we
did
a
great
"job,"
he
has
no
clue.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
should
have
"opened.\""
he
"goes,"
"\"i"
should
have
shut
down
one
week
"earlier.\""
what
he
doesn't
say
is
he
did
the
worst
job
in
the
history
of
an
epidemic
or
a
pandemic
with
the
swine
flu.
it
was
a
joke.
and
what
he
"did,"
his
own
"man,"
that
was
in
charge
said
"recently,"
"\"we"
had
no
idea
what
the
hell
we
were
doing.
it
was
a
total
"disaster.\""
there
were
amateurs.
and
now
he
tells
us
how
to
do
something
that's
far
more
lethal.
but
he
"said,"
"\""
they
should
have
closed
one
week
"early,\""
except
when
it
came
to
closing
the
"border,"
which
i
"did,"
which
turned
out
to
save
tens
of
thousands
of
"lives,"
biden
criticized
me
until
two
months
later
when
he
said
i
was
right.
but
we
should
have
closed
a
weak
earlier.
think
of
that.
we
pioneered
lifesaving
"therapies,"
reducing
the
fatality
rate
85%
since
april.
think
of
that.
"remdesivir,"
the
"plasmas,"
we
have
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
of
any
major
country.
nobody
knows
that.
and
i
am
devastated
to
see
it
"happening,"
but
you
see
what's
going
on
in
europe
again.
they
were
always
"saying,"
"\"oh,"
europe
is
doing
"better.\""
actually
we
did
"better,"
but
now
europe
has
a
big
"spike,"
a
big
spike.
so
they're
not
talking
about
that.
the
number
of
hospitalized
virus
patients
is
down
by
47%
and
virus
patients
coming
to
the
emergency
room
is
down
and
visits
are
way
"down,"
visits
to
hospital.
europe
has
almost
a
50%
greater
excess
mortality
rate
than
the
united
states.
they're
liking
to
compare
us
to
europe.
50%
greater
excess
mortality
rate.
our
early
and
aggressive
action
saved
millions
of
lives
through
operation
warp
speed.
you've
heard
about
"it,"
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
what
we've
done
in
a
record
period
of
time
with
the
"ventilators,"
now
we're
building
ventilators
for
the
world.
very
hard
to
do.
we'll
develop
and
distribute
a
vaccine
"very,"
very
shortly
in
record
"time,"
it
would
have
been
two
or
three
"years,"
four
"years,"
if
biden's
group
had
done
"it,"
but
we've
done
a
great
job
with
the
fda
in
clearing
a
path
and
you'll
be
seeing
it
very
shortly.
and
these
are
great
companies
that
are
doing
it.
so
we'll
crush
the
virus
and
our
opponents
"will,"
with
"him,"
they
will
crush
america.
we
can't
let
it
happen.
this
country
is
too
great.
our
love
of
each
other
is
too
great.
this
guy
doesn't
know
he's
alive.
he
really
doesn't.
he
doesn't
know
he's
alive.
he
did
an
ad
on
an
anonymous
source
that
said
about
me
making
a
statement
about
military
soldiers
that
died.
and
it
was
such
a
disgusting
thing.
i
"said,"
"\"the"
only
good
thing
about
it
is
now
i
can
take
the
gloves
"off.\""
this
guy
doesn't
have
a
clue.
he
doesn't
know
where
the
hell
he
is
and
they'll
give
him
a
shot
of
something.
i
don't
"know,"
he's
going
to
get
something.
because
i
watched
him
so
"badly,"
he
performed
so
badly
in
the
"debates,"
and
then
with
"bernie,"
he
was
"average,"
not
"great,"
but
he
got
through
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
he
"taking?\""
and
we'd
like
to
ask
him.
and
i
said
"that,"
"\"we"
want
a
drug
"test,"
we
want
a
drug
test.
we'll
both
take
it.
we'll
both
take
"it.\""
because
with
bernie
he
was
able
to
get
through.
but
"listen,"
it
wasn't
winston
churchill.
this
wasn't
the
"greatest,"
but
he
got
"through,"
it
was
fine.
him
and
bernie
screaming
at
each
"other,"
mostly
bernie.
crazy
bernie.
he's
not
too
happy.
i'll
tell
"you,"
did
you
ever
see
a
better
loser
than
bernie
though?
seriously.
he's
a
good
loser.
he
got
terribly
treated
by
hillary
and
that
group.
and
then
it
happened
again
with
elizabeth
"warren,"
right?
it
happened
again.
what
the
democrat
party
did
to
him.
and
then
you
have
this
"guy,"
mike
"bloomberg,"
mini
"mike,"
one
question
and
he
was
gone.
there
goes
1.8
billion
out
their
window.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
think
it's
easy
up
"here,"
"mike,"
don't
"ya?\""
one
question
and
that
was
the
end.
he
"said,"
"\"where"
am
i?
get
me
the
hell
off
of
this
"platform.\""
mini
"mike,"
mini
mike.
so
now
he's
trying
to
buy
into
the
party.
you
would
think
after
the
way
they
treated
"him,"
they
called
him
every
"name,"
pocahontas
destroyed
"him,"
she
didn't
do
good
against
"me,"
but
boy
did
she
do
good
against
mini
mike.
i
figured
he'd
be
calling
and
"saying,"
"\"listen,"
i
want
to
become
a
"republican.\""
we've
done
great
for
the
"economy,"
you'd
think.
but
he
always
wanted
to
run
for
"president,"
and
he
tried
"before,"
i
"guess,"
but
he
tried
and
it
was
a
bad
experience.
and
you
would
think
he
would
have
joined
our
party.
but
instead
he's
trying
to
buy
his
way
back
in.
when
somebody
treats
you
that
"way,"
even
stay
"neutral,"
don't
go
back
in.
he
wants
to
give
them
a
lot
of
money
to
try
and
buy
their
friendship.
and
one
thing
you
learned
about
"politics,"
i
spent
a
fraction
of
the
money
that
crooked
hillary
spent.
they
raised
$2
billion.
i
spent
my
own
"money,"
but
i
spent
a
fraction
of
the
money…
i
spent
my
own
"money,"
but
i
spent
a
fraction
of
the
"money,"
like
"35%,"
"30%,"
and
we
won.
nobody
ever
says
that.
it's
not
about
money.
it's
about
other
things.
there
are
other
things
involved.
it's
not
just
about
money.
in
the
old
"days,"
my
father
would
teach
"me,"
"\"if"
you
can
win
and
spend
"less,"
that's
a
good
"thing.\""
i
remember
after
i
won
and
i
won
decisively
"look,"
306
to
223.
that's
a
lot.
306
"delegates,"
"306,"
that's
decisive.
we
won
michigan
and
we're
going
to
win
it
again.
we're
up
in
a
poll
just
now.
"oh,"
they're
going
crazy.
they're
going
crazy.
we
won
wisconsin.
we
won
pennsylvania.
but
my
father
taught
me.
he
"said,"
"\"if"
you
can
win
and
spend
less
"money,"
that's
a
good
"thing,"
not
a
bad
thing.
that's
a
good
"thing,"
not
a
bad
"thing.\""
like
if
you
get
along
with
the
leaders
of
other
lands
and
don't
go
to
war
all
the
time
with
everybody
and
can
come
out
on
top
without
having
to
shed
blood
all
over
the
place
and
destroy
your
families
and
your
"country,"
like
when
i
get
along
with
"putin,"
when
i
get
along
with
kim
jong-un.
whatever
happened
to
the
war
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
with
north
korea?
nothing
happened.
they
said
i
gave
away
so
much.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
did
i
give
"away?\""
they
couldn't
find
that
anything.
i
didn't
do
anything.
they
"said,"
"\"you"
"met.\""
"\"oh,"
i
met.
"oh,"
okay.
i
"met.\""
now
you
would
have
been
in
war
with
her.
you
would
have
been
in
war.
but
if
you
can
"spend,"
think
of
"this,"
if
you
can
spend
less
money
and
"win,"
that's
a
good
thing.
so
after
i
won
one
of
these
people
back
"there,"
right
back
there-
…
in
order
to
keep
the
thing
going
on
"trump,"
i
had
"won,"
he
"said,"
"\"but"
trump
raised
substantially
less
money
than
crooked
hillary
"clinton.\""
that's
because
i
didn't
need
the
money.
i
didn't
need
the
money.
i
can
call
up
a
lot
of
rich
guys
that
raised
a
lot
of
"money,"
but
i
feel
uncomfortable
doing
it
because
when
you
do
"that,"
it's
like
you're
sort
of
…
it's
not
the
same.
i
could
call
up
every
guy.
they
call
me
up
and
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
how
are
"you,"
sir?
mr.
"president,"
"sir.\""
i
have
friends
see.
i
don't
have
too
many
friends
up
because
i
used
to
be
comfortable.
you
have
to
be
comfortable
with
"people,"
right?
i
have
"friends,"
i
have
one
"friend,"
richard.
i
talk
about
him
all
the
"time,"
but
multiply
this
times
a
hundred
people.
richard
used
to
call
me
up
"five,"
six
years
ago.
"\"hey,"
let's
have
"dinner.\""
"\"all"
right.
where
do
you
want
to
"go?\""
"\"i"
don't
know.
go
to
some
crazy
"restaurant.\""
today
the
restaurants
are
all
closed
in
new
york.
they
don't
want
to
open
them.
they
want
to
make
them
do
badly
until
november
but
don't
"worry,"
they're
opening
in
november
4th.
but
it's
true.
"so,"
it's
richard
on
the
"phone,"
"richard,"
my
friend
for
"many,"
many
years.
i
"said,"
"\"hey"
"richard,"
how
are
you
"doing?\""
"\"mr."
president
"sir,"
how
are
"you?\""
i
"said,"
"\"well"
…
"\""
he's
been
calling
donnie
and
don
and
"dj,"
and
all.
"\"richard,"
are
you
okay?
everything
"good?\""
"\"yes,"
sir.
mr.
"president,"
sir.
you're
doing
a
great
job
and
i'd
like
to
thank
"you.\""
"\"good,"
richard.
"richard,"
loosen
up
please.
you
don't
have
to
call
me
mr.
"parson.\""
i
"said,"
"\"just"
call
me
donald.
it's
"okay.\""
"\"thank"
you
donald.
i
really
appreciate
"it.\""
and
you
hear
the
guy
can't
breathe.
he's
having
a
hard
time
breathing.
he's
very
nervous.
then
at
the
end
of
the
"phone,"
he
"goes,"
"\"mr."
president
"again,"
thank
you
so
much
for
the
job
you
"do,\""
and
he
hangs
up.
i
"said,"
how
can
you
be
friends
with
…
?
it
just
doesn't
work.
it's
"like,"
i've
lost
a
lot
of
people
this
way.
it's
called
respect
for
the
office.
they
have
respect
for
the
office.
they
really
do.
nothing
wrong
with
it.
i
sort
of
understand
that.
they
have
respect
for
the
office.
nobody
has
more
respect
for
this
offices
than
i
do.
that's
why
i'm
doing
a
great
"job,"
and
i'll
always
do
a
great
job.
it's
respect
for
the
office.
but
on
november
"3rd,"
"pennsylvania,"
will
decide
whether
we
end
the
"pandemic,"
defeat
the
virus
and
return
to
record
prosperity
just
like
we
were
"before,"
or
whether
we
allow
sleepy
joe
"biden,"
who
doesn't
have
a
"clue,"
to
kill
the
"recovery,"
raise
your
"taxes,"
delay
the

wants
to
impose

you

"hey,"
let's
go

…
when
i
did
"this,"
i
took
a
lot
of
heat.
i
got
rid
of
a
regulation.
they
all
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we'll
amend
the
regulation.
we're
going

amend

i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't

a
couple
of
stories
where
written.
i
wish
the

living
in

would
read
these

were
written
by
people
that
"say,"
"\"i"
can't
believe
a
president
had
the
guts
to
do
"it.\""
i
did
because
i
want
to
save
the
american
dream.
by
the
"way,"
a
big
part
of
the
american
dream
are
minorities
who
made
it
and
they
want
to
live
in
the
suburbs
and
they
don't
want
to
be
next
to
a
project.
remember?
sleepy
joe.
he'll
do
it
because
he
has
no
choice
because
they
have
total
power.
he's
like
a
puppet
for
them
and
indoctrinate
your
children
with
poisonous
anti-american
lies.
to
combat
the
toxic
left
wing
propaganda
in

"schools,"
i
announced
last
week
that
we
are
launching
a
new
pro-american
lesson
plan
for
students
called

commission.
we
will
teach
our
children
the
truth
about
"america,"
that
we
are
the
most
exceptional
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
getting
better
every
single
day.
we're
not
going
to
let
it
fail.

then
they

we
love
"them,"

you
know
what?
we
call
it
a

because
the

thing
you're
allowed
to
do
in

can't
go

endorsed.
and
you
know
that's
hard
when
you
have
radical
left
running
the
"city,"
all
"politicians,"
the
mayor.
i
got
endorsed
by
the
chicago
police.
can
you
imagine
that?
i
got
endorsed
by
oklahoma
and
i
got
endorsed
by
texas
and
louisiana.
i
got
endorsed
by
"florida,"
the
sheriffs.
all
the
sheriffs
got
"together,"
they
endorsed
trump.
i
got
endorsed
by
law
"enforcement,"
everybody.
but
how
could
you
possibly
endorse
people
that
hate
you
and
don't
respect
the
job
you
"do,"
and
don't
let
you
do
your
job
most
importantly?
because
if
they
let
you
do
what
you
do
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
"world,"
you
wouldn't
have
problems.
these
are
other
police
departments.
you
look
at
seattle.
we
said
we're
going
"in,"
and
they
immediately
"said,"
"\"we'll"
put
up
our
"hands.\""
it
was
so
easy.
we
were
going
in
the
following
day.
you
look
at
portland.
how
about
portland?
it's
like
an
anarchist's
dream.
we're
dealing
with
the
"governor,"
because
you
"know,"
i
hate
to
say
"it,"
but
they're
all
democrat-run
cities
and
states.
all
of
"them,"
every
single
one.
the
republicans
are
doing
"great,"
but
they
have
to
ask.
by
"law,"
they
have
to
ask
us
to
go
in.
but
do
you
remember
that
beautiful
day?
it
was
10
days
late.
you
had
these
people
from
cnn
and
other
places.
"\"these"
are
friendly
"protests.\""
that's
a
lovely
thing
to
say.
as
he's
getting
rocks
and
cans
of
tuna
fish.
they
go
out
to
buy
tuna
fish
and
soup.
you
know
"that,"
right?
goya.
i
hope
"goya,"
he's
"great,"
isn't
he?
good
guy.
they
go
out
and
buy
goya
because
they
throw
it.
they
throw
it.
it's
the
perfect
"weight,"
tuna
fish
they
can
really
rip
"it,"
and
that
hits
you.
"no,"
it's
true.
bumblebee
brand
"tuna,"
and
you
can
throw
it
at
"soccer,"
you
can
a
curve
on
it.
you
can
do
whatever
else
you
want.
the
cops
in
"chicago,"
you
"saw,"
they're
going
like
this.
it
was
terrible.
they're
not
allowed
to
fight
back.
they're
not
allowed
to
fight
back.
these
guys
if
they
fight
"back,"
nobody's
going
to
be
there
very
long
throwing
things.
but
they're
"professionals,"
they're
anarchists.
they're
paid
for
by
outside
stupid
rich
people
that
…
they're
stupid
people.
by
the
"way,"
you
know
the
first
ones
that
get
wiped
out?
they
don't
have
a
shot
by
the
"way,"
i'll
tell
you
"that,"
but
if
they
ever
"did,"
the
first
ones
that
would
get
wiped
out
are
the
stupid
people
that
gave
them
the
money
to
do
this
stuff.
those
are
the
people
that
would
get
wiped
out.
but
you
"know,"
they're
very
smart.
everything
is
perfect.
do
you
ever
see
where
they
drop
the
bricks
along
the
thing
in
a
bag?
then
they
"drop,"
everyone
picks
them
"up,"
throws
them
at
our
great
police.
we're
not
going
to
let
that
stuff
"happen,"
but
this
is
all
a
democrat.
it
doesn't
happen
with
republicans.
i
was
with
greg
abbott.
i
was
with
ron
"desantis,"
texas
and
florida
and
other
governors
that
can't
even
believe
a
thing
like
that
could
"happen,"
but
they
get
caught.
they're
walking
up.
there're
like
30
cans
of
soup.
they
have
like
25
cans
of
tuna.
they
get
caught.
"\"i'm"
bringing
this
home
to
my
family.
how
dare
you
stop
"me?\""
"no,"
"no,"
no.
they
use
it
as
ammunition.
it's
terrible
shame.
but
he
went
down
and
he
didn't
like
it.
he
was
hit.
"\"police"
"brutality.\""
you
remember
that?
they
walked
"in,"
and
they've
got
the
tear
gas.
they've
got
everything
you
can
possibly
have.
pepper
spray.
they
don't
want
you
to
use
tear
gas
anymore.
in
some
places
like
i
think
in
"milwaukee,"
they
said
no
tear
"gas,"
no
pepper
spray.
how
the
hell
do
you
keep
big
crowds
back?
you
can't.
so
the
police
all
quit.
they
all
quit.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
can't
do
"it.\""
but
you
"remember,"
they
went
out
and
you
had
"one,"
then
you
had
"two,"
"three,"
"four,"
then
you
had
"five,"
"six,"
seven.
all
of
a
sudden
they
started
pouring
in.
they
were
getting
off
the
buses.
they
came
from
a
different
"locale,"
and
then
you
had
a
line
of
them
and
there
was
no
social
distancing
unfortunately.
in
"fact,"
i
was
going
to
turn
them
in
because
they
were
right
next
to
each
other.
they
were
right
next
to
each
other.
they
were
touching
arms
and
they
had
"big,"
strong
arms
like
these
guys
right
over
here.
there
were
big
strong
guys.
that's
all
right.
they
were
like
together.
then
you
saw
the
first
line.
then
you
saw
the
second
"line,"
then
you
saw
a
third
"line,"
and
then
you
saw
a
fourth
line.
then
they
"said,"
"\"march.\""
they
never
halted.
just
walked
right
"through,"
cleaned
everything
"up,"
and
minneapolis
was
cured.
they
were
cured.
they
grabbed
them.
they
grabbed
them.
they
grabbed
them.
they
were
grabbing
them
left
and
right.
sometimes
they
"grabbed,"
they
grabbed
one
"guy,"
"\"i'm"
a
reporter.
i'm
a
"reporter.\""
"\"get"
out
of
"here.\""
they
throw
him
aside
like
he
was
a
little
bag
of
popcorn.
but
"no,"
but
i
"mean,"
"honestly,"
when
you
watch
the
crap
that
we've
all
had
to
take
so
"long,"
when
you
see
"that,"
it's
actually
…
you
don't
want
to
do
"that,"
but
when
you
see
"it,"
it's
actually
a
beautiful
sight.
it's
a
beautiful
sight.
behind
him
was
like
10
blocks
of
fire
was
…
i'd
never.
it's
a
classic.
i
don't
know.
"anybody,"
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
is
it
…
"so,"
i
just
have
such
"respect,"
but
you
have
to
let
these
great
professionals
do
what
they
do
best.
you
have
to
let
them
do
what
they
…
it's
called
law
and
order.
we
need
law
and
order.
"so,"
democrat
phenomena.
if
they
"win,"
sleepy
"joe,"
if
they
"win,"
because
he
has
no
power
over
these
"people,"
these
people
are
crazed
lunatics.
if
they
"win,"
your
cities
will
be
like
this.
you'll
lose
all
rights.
your
constitution
will
be
worthless.
it'll
be
a
"terrible,"
terrible
thing.
i'm
not
even
sure
"that,"
after
some
time
listening
to
that
and
going
along
with
"it,"
i'm
not
even
sure
the
country
can
ever
recover.
that's
how
bad
it
would
be.
i'm
not
sure
it
could
ever
recover.
over
labor
day.
left-wing
radicals
rampaged
through
"pittsburgh,"
harassing
diners
at
restaurants.
i
saw
that
one.
that
was
horrible.
"no,"
i
saw
"that,"
right?
i
saw
that.
that
one
guy
grabs
a
"woman,"
a
older
"woman,"
she's
eating
a
steak.
he
grabbed
the
steak
and
started
eating
"it,"
then
he
threw
it
back
on
the
plate.
an
outdoor
"place,"
and
her
husband
standing
there
like
they're
afraid
for
their
lives.
it
was
a
terrible
"thing,"
and
should
never
be
allowed
to
happen.
a
thing
like
that
should
just
be
closed
up
before
it
ever
gets
started.
that
was
terrible.
remember
that?
an
older
woman.
last
week
after
a
police
officer
shot
a
knife-wielding
"assailant,"
over
100
rioters
rampaged
in
lancaster.
went
to
school
right
nearby.
looting
"businesses,"
setting
fires
and
assaulting
police
offices
with
rocks
and
bricks
and
glass.
you
saw
that.
joe
biden
has
the
support
of
violent
left
wing
extremists.
he
never
once
mentioned
the
words
law
and
order
during
their
entire
democrat
national
convention.
never
once.
they
didn't
talk
about
the
"riots,"
they
didn't
talk
about
anything
having
to
do
with
law
and
order
and
respect
and
our
great
police.
they
didn't
do
it.
they
didn't
talk
about
it.
it's
not
a
subject.
they
will
rip
your
cities
apart
and
they
will
go
to
your
suburbs
for
all
of
those
people
in
the
suburbs
that
are
ready
to
go
"about,"
they
will
go
to
your
suburbs
next.
i
have
the
support
of
america's
law
enforcement
heroes.
i
was
recently
honored
to

somewhat
…
this
is
crazy
what's
going

"oh,"

you
hear

"said,"

the
republicans
stuck
together.

was
great.
"also,"
a
friend
of

and
he
wanted
to
just
rip
them
"apart,"
i

stonecold
phony.
when
he
was
running

it's
a
very
trump
…
they
like

i
thought

a

i'll
tell

the
real

well
they're
not

but
i
have
a
woman
with

tonight
who
has
devoted
so
much.
she
gave
up

business.
she
"said,"

i'm
going

i
love

we're
going

…
"\""
she
was
very
successful
in
every
"way,"
and
it's
my
daughter
ivanka.
i
just
want
to
thank
this
group
of
people.
and
a
man
that
"helped,"
we
just
negotiated
a
major
peace
deal
in
the
middle
east.
everyone
said
it
was
impossible.
you
know
"that,"
right?
they
said
it's
impossible.
they've
been
killing
everybody
for
years
and
"years,"
they
had
this
"guy,"
john
"kerry,"
who's
grossly
incompetent.
they
paid
$150
billion
to
"iran,"
they
paid
1.8
billion
in
cash.
that's
even
more
"impressive,"
"frankly,"
in
"cash,"
that's
john
kerry.
and
we
just
made
a
deal
with
bahrain
and
"uae,"
united
arab
"emirates,"
and
"israel,"
and
it's
a
great
thing.
and
the
man
right
"there,"
"jared,"
the
"abuse,"
the
abuse
he
"takes,"
but
he
did
something
that
nobody's
been
able
to
"do,"
and
he
wants
none
of
the
"glory,"
he'd
rather
not
come
up
here.
these
guys
will
come
up
100%.
"jared,"
great
"deal,"
great
job.
incredible.
everyone's
talking
about
it.
we
have
plenty
of
other
countries
going
to
join
and
there's
no
blood
in
the
sand.
okay.
thanks
honey.
thank
you.
great
people.
thank
"you,"
sean.
thank
"you,"
sean.
we
have
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
damage
that
joe
biden
inflicted
over
the
last
40.
they
like
sean.
"sean,"
will
you
please
win?
sean
parnell.
i'll
tell
"you,"
he's
popular.
that's
"great,"
sean.
we
love
sean.
but
biden
championed
every
globalist
portrayal
of
pennsylvania
for
half
a
"century,"
he
was
a
cheerleader
for
the
worst
trade
deal
ever
made
by
any
"country,"
nafta
and
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
"organization,"
which
built
china
like
a
rocket
ship.
they
were
flat
lined
for
"many,"
many
decades
and
then
right
through
the
"roof,"
that
was
a
biden
approval.
these
disasters
ripped
out
one
third
of
your
state's
manufacturing
jobs.
you
know
what
happened.
biden
shouldn't
be
asking
for
your
"vote,"
he
should
be
begging
for
your
forgiveness.
he
did
a
terrible
job.
now
the
democrat
party
is
pledging
to
rejoin
the
disastrous
paris
climate
accord.
you
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
for
nothing?
eviscerating
your
state's
"economy,"
you
will
spend
a
trillion
dollars
and
what
it
is
"really,"
it
takes
away
your
"power,"
it
takes
away
your
energy.
you'll
be
closing
your
plants
and
factories
all
over
the
place.
i
withdrew
from
it.
and
you
know
"what,"
the
people
that
"understand,"
the
smart
"people,"
they
"said,"
"\"i"
can't
believe
you
had
the
guts
to
do
"it.\""
and
i
figured
i
was
going
to
be
absolutely
killed
on
this
one.
and
you
know
"what,"
i'm
so
proud
i
did
it
and
people
get
it.
it
was
a
rip
off
of
the
united
states.
i
withdrew
from
the
catastrophe
because
i
was
elected
to
fight
for
"pittsburgh,"
not
for
paris.
this
election
is
a
choice
between
pennsylvania
and
"china,"
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
when
we
"win,"
pennsylvania
wins
and
america
wins.
for
"decades,"
our
politicians
spent
trillions
of
dollars
rebuilding
foreign
"nations,"
fighting
foreign
wars
that
never
ended
and
defending
foreign
borders.
but
now
we're
finally
protecting
our
"nation,"
rebuilding
our
cities
and
we
are
bringing
our
"jobs,"
our
"factories,"
and
our
"troops,"
back
home
in
the
usa
where
they
belong.
all
coming
home.
during
the
"pandemic,"
i've
suspended
the
entry
of
foreign
workers
who
threatened
american
jobs.
as
our
economy
"reopens,"
i
want
to
ensure
that
americans
are
first
in
line
to
get
the
great
jobs
and
the
high
wages.
america
first.
biden
wants
to
flood
the
economy
with
cheap
labor
to
replace
us
workers.
you
know
that.
and
that's
why
"never,"
"never,"
i
see
his
"say,"
hire
american.
he
got
it
for
"me,"
all
the
words
he's
got
"there,"
are
my
"words,"
right?
do
you
ever
see
it?
they
say
he
copied
my
campaign.
i
keep
"saying,"
what
the
hell
happened
for
47
years
and
now
he's
copying
my
campaign.
as
president
…
and
you
know
it's
not
going
to
happen
with
"him,"
as
"president,"
i
know
my
first
duty
is
always
to
take
care
of
"you,"
the
american
worker.
that's
what
we're
taking
care
of.
under
my
"administration,"
we've
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
us
history
and
we
are
finishing
that
"wall,"
it's
going
to
be
done
so
fast.
it's
got
to
be
done
so
fast.
since
2017
ice
has
successfully
arrested
nearly
a
half
a
million
illegal
aliens
with
criminal
"records,"
including
over
"145,000"
"assaults,"
"40,000"
sex
offenses
and
"5,000"
murderers.
if
you
don't
"mind,"
democrats
will
bring
them
the
hell
out
of
our
"country,"
we'll
get
them
out
of
here.
some
of
them
are
so
"violent,"
we
have
to
keep
them.
we
don't
want
to
house
them
for
50
"years,"
but
if
we
let
them
"go,"
they
come
back
"in,"
as
much
as
we
watch.
if
they
come
back
"in,"
we
don't
want
"it,"
we
don't
want
them.
so
we
keep
them
"here,"
we
have
no
choice.
if
the
left
gains
"power,"
they
will
abolish
…
republicans
will
always
…
they're
going
to
abolish.
republicans
will
always
stand
with
these
incredible
heroes
of
ice
and
border
patrol.
you
have
to
see
these
ice
people.
they
go
into
a
den
of
"ms13,"
and
they
call
them
a
"den,"
a
"nest,"
where
you
have
these
guys
that
are
"vicious,"
vicious
gang
members.
and
they
go
in
"there,"
they
just
start
swinging.
it's
the
craziest
"thing,"
they
love
it.
"now,"
who
wants
that
job?
do
you
want
that
job?
"look,"
he's
a
tough
guy
sitting
"here,"
you
"too,"
you're
tough
"guys,"
you
don't
want
any
part
of
it.
they're
just
incredible
and
they
love
our
country.
they
love
our
country.
and
then
people
"say,"
"\""
"oh,"
they're
too
rough.
they're
too
"rough.\""
you
have
no
idea
how
bad
some
of
these
gangs
are
and
what
they
do.
they
use
knives
because
it's
more
painful.
they
cut
people
up.
they
cut
two
"young,"
beautiful
"girls,"
16
years
old.
they
were
going
home
from
school
and
they
cut
them
to
"pieces,"
killed
"them,"
they're
animals.
we
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military
and
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
us
armed
forces
in
75
"years,"
space
force.
not
since
the
air
force.
think
of
"it,"
the
air
force
was
last.
if
i
did
just
"that,"
space
force
big
"deal,"
by
the
"way,"
it's
going
to
end
up
being
one
of
the
most
important
things
you've
ever
imagined.
but
if
i
just
did
"that,"
a
sixth
branch
of
the
us
"military,"
that
would
be
a
big
deal.
that's
like
one
of
"many,"
many
things.
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
accountability.
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
"al-baghdadi,"
they
were
after
him
for
a
year.
we
took
out
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murderer
of
american
troops
and
many
others.
qasem
soleimani
is
gone.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
one
of
the
great
disasters.
and
by
the
"way,"
it's
practically
expired.
the
crazy
deal
that
obama
made
practically
expired.
and
his
chief
"negotiator,"
he
never
left.
"\""
i
want
"this.\""
"\"nope."
we're
not
giving
to
"you.\""
"\"okay,"
let's
go
on
to
the
next
one.
give
me
"this.\""
"\"nope.\""
"\"give"
me
"this.\""
"\"nope.\""
"\"give"
me
"this.\""
"\"nope.\""
he
never
won
a
"point,"
he
lost
everything.
it's
the
worst
deal
i've
ever
seen.
and
the
only
time
he
left
the
table
is
to
go
on
a
bicycle
ride
and
he
crashed
and
broke
his
leg
and
his
arm.
and
i
promised
everybody
i
would
never
go
riding
in
a
bicycle
race.
i
swear
to
you.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
i
also
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
that
was
a
52
year
development
that
i
got
done
in
about
a
day.
they'd
been
negotiating
that
sovereignty
over
the
golan
"heights,"
i
got
it
done
immediately.
52
"years,"
they
worked
on
that.
but
instead
of
endless
"war,"
we
are
forging
peace
in
the
middle
east.
it's
so
great.
peace
in
the
middle
east.
so
biden's
put
forward
a
platform
that
would
end
america
as
we
know
it.
and
this
is
true.
i
don't
think
of
him
as
a
radical
"lefty,"
but
basically
he's
controlled
by
them.
and
what
about
this
kamala?
how
about
her?
she
at
"15%,"
"no,"
she's
at
13%.
then
people
started
…
no
she's
at
12.
"no,"
she's
at
10.
she's
at
"nine,"
she's
at
seven.
these
are
a
poll
numbers.
she
got
worse
than
worse.
she
quit
before
she
ever
got
to
iowa.
we
have
a
great
vice
"president,"
mike
pence.
he's
great
and
he
says
hello.
if
"elected,"
biden
would
destroy
social
security
and
destroy
protections
for
preexisting
"conditions,"
people
with
preexisting
"conditions,"
drain
your
medicare
by
giving
away
your
healthcare
to
illegal
immigrants.
they're
all
going
to
come
in.
if
you
have
"that,"
the
problem
is
we're
going
to
give
you
"healthcare,"
they're
going
to
all
pour
into
the
united
states
and
our
country
can't
afford
it.
we
want
to
be
"nice,"
we
all
have
"hearts,"
country
can't
afford
it.
they
would
get
people
that
never
even
thought
of
coming
if
they
see
that.
can't
do
it.
they
would
end
our
travel
bans
on
jihadist
regions.
we
have
very
strong
…
remember
i
got
travel
bans.
everyone
thought
it
was
such
a
terrible
"thing,"
such
a
terrible
person.
he's
such
a
terrible
person.
i'm
such
a
bad
"guy,"
i
got
travel
bans.
and
increase
refugee
admissions
by
more
than
"700%,"
opening
the
flood
gates
to
radical
islamic
terrorism.
ban
school
choice
and
all
charter
"schools,"
they're
very
important.
in
the
second
"term,"
i
will
provide
school
choice
to
every
parent
in
america.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
"jobs,"
and
a
limitless
future
for
all
americans.
all
"americans,"
"race,"
"color,"
"creed,"
all
americans.
so
in
"conclusion,"
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world
and
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
"china,"
once
and
for
all.
we
will
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
"states,"
right
here
in
pennsylvania.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increase
penalties
for
assaults
or
law
enforcement
and
we
will
ban
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
we'd
ban
them.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
thank
you.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
speech
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
citizens
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
"endless,"
"ridiculous,"
stupid
foreign
wars.
we
losing
our
youth
to
countries
that
you'd
never
even
heard
"of,"
right?
never
even
heard
of
them.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military
"might,"
and
we
will
ensure
peace
through
strength.
we
will
"surprise,"
think
of
the
surprise
medical
"billing,"
we're
going
to
end
"it,"
surprise.
you
ever
walk
into
a
"hospital,"
"oh,"
"gee,"
fix
you
up.
"oh,"
great.
then
you
get
a
bill
for
"$2,000"
for
a
band-aid.
we
will
end
surprise
medical
"billing,"
require
price
"transparency,"
which
i've
already
signed
and
brilliantly
starts
on
january
1st.
"hey,"
you
better
vote
for
me.
you
"know,"
i
think
"that's,"
in
a
"way,"
bigger
than
healthcare.
can
you
imagine
biden
if
he
won?
price
transparency
is
so
"big,"
it's
all
"done,"
it
starts
on
january
1st.
how
smart
is
that?
how
smart.
and
you're
going
to
see
numbers
and
reductions
like
you've
never
seen.
could
you
imagine
if
he
were
"president,"
"\"sir,"
our
medical
costs
have
dropped
in
half
price.
transparency
has
been
"unbelievable.\""
"\"what"
is
that?
what
is
price
"transparency?\""
and
they'll
explain
it
to
him.
he
still
won't
have
a
clue.
but
can
you
imagine
giving
him
credit?
i
signed
"it,"
it's
all
done.
it
starts
on
january
1st.
i
"say,"
"\"why"
can't
you
start
it
"now,"
just
in
"case?\""
and
know
what
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
"statutorily,"
it
has
to
start
"then.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
let's
"go.\""
but
i
know
we're
going
to
"win,"
so
it's
not
going
to
matter.
and
we're
going
to
further
reduce
health
insurance
premiums
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs.
we
have
a
favored
nations
"laws,"
well
now
we
get
the
same
price
as
all
these
nations
that
are
paying
a
tiny
"fraction,"
which
should
have
been
instituted
a
long
time
ago.
and
the
drug
companies
are
going
after
me
with
those
ads.
"oh,"
it's
"terrible,"
terrible.
you
know
why?
just
every
time
you
see
an
add
from
the
drug
"company,"
they
got
plenty
of
"money,"
that's
why
nobody
ever
fights
them.
anytime
you
see
an
ad
from
a
drug
"company,"
just
remember
one
"thing,"
your
drug
prices
are
coming
down.
that's
what
it
means.
that's
what
it
means.
we
will
strongly
protect
medicare
and
social
security
and
we
will
always
protect

we
will
protect
every

america

will
be

on

you
"know,"
nasa
was
an
absolute
"disaster,"
grass
was
growing
through
the
fairways
too.
they
had
"fairways,"
that's
about
all
they
"use,"
were
the
fairways.
and
now
we
have
"something,"
right
through
the
"runways,"
the
landing
"strips,"
it
was
all
grass
"infested,"
it
was
all
weed
"infested,"
and
now
it's
the
number
one
space
center
in
the
"world,"
by
far.
it
was
a
closed
up
mess.
and
we
have
rich
guys
sending
up
"rockets,"
elon
and
others.
they
send
up
rockets
and
we
"say,"
let
them
keep
going.
let
them
keep
spending
money
on
these
rockets.
they
love
rockets.
we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students
and
restore
patriotic
education
to
our

we
will
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
history
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.

we
will
live
by
the
timeless
words
in
our
national
"motto,"
in

trust.

we
leave
in
"10,"
"14,"
"18,"
22
years
from
"now,"
the
new
york
times
will
be
out
of
business
and
so
will
a
lot
of
others.
"but,"
did
you
see
they
did
a
new
york
times
"poll,"
i
"think,"
and
"sienna,"
"sienna,"
new
york
times
of
"iowa,"
and
they
have
me
pitted
against
every
one
of
the
"socialists,"
and
we're
winning
by
a
lot.
everyone.
we're
beating
them
all.
we're
beating
them
all.
we're
beating
them
all.
we're
beating
them
like
they
haven't
been
beaten
before.
you
know
all
the
noises
about
their
crazy
"debates,"
nobody's
watching
their
"debates,"
but
it's
all
about
their
debates.
they
don't
care
about
the
farmer.
everything
out
"here,"
they
love
"trump,"
and
you
should
love
trump
with
what
i've
done.
"so,"
we're
going
to
win
the
great
state
of
iowa
and
it's
going
to
be
a
historic
landslide.
if
we
don't
"win,"
your
farms
are
going
to
hell.
i
can
tell
you
right
now.
"sell,"
"sell,"
they'll
be
saying
"\"sell.\""
"no,"
we
love
the
"farmers,"
and
we
love
the
"ranchers,"
and
we
love
the
"manufacturers,"
frankly.
you
got
plenty
of
that
too
in
this
state.
the
great
"state,"
and
you
have
a
great
"governor,"
by
the
way.
you
have
a
great
governor.
but
every
day
we're
achieving
extraordinary
victories
for
the
citizens
of
the
hawkeye
state.
the
iowa
unemployment
rate
has
reached
an
all
time
low
in
history.
that's
not
bad.
that's
not
bad.
"oh,"
let's
vote
for
pocahontas.
let's
vote
for
bernie.
let's
vote
for
sleepy
joe.
he's
falling
asleep.
"joe,"
"joe,"
joe.
he
always
gets
the
name
wrong.
how
many
times
has
he
missed
it?
he's
in
iowa.
he
"says,"
"\"great"
to
be
in
the
great
state
of
"ohio.\""
they
"say,"
"\"joe,"
you're
in
"iowa.\""
you
can't
do
that.
no
matter
how
great
you
speak.
if
you're
winston
"churchill,"
if
you
make
that
mistake
at
the
beginning
of
your
"speech,"
it's
over.
you
might
as
well
just
wrap
it
up.
there's
the
fake
news.
they
would
just
absolutely
destroy
you.
they
would
absolutely
destroy
you.
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't
do
"that,"
"joe,"
sleepy
"joe,"
but
you
have
these
guys.
you
have
these
people.
how
about
buttigieg?
buttigieg.
they
call
him
mayor
pete.
you
know
why?
because
nobody
can
pronounce
his
name.
nobody
has
any
idea.
buttigieg.
they
"say,"
"\"say"
edge
"edge.\""
he
presides
over
a
city
that's
failed.
it's
doing
so
"badly,"
in
a
state
that's
having
the
greatest
year
they've
ever
"had,"
and
they
have
a
great
governor
"also,"
and
they
had
a
great
governor.
you
just
heard
from
"him,"
right?
the
great
state
of
"indiana,"
so
i
don't
see
that
one.
go
down
the
line.
we
have
some
people.
let's
not
talk
about
them.
what
happened
to
mini
mike?
where
is
he?
he's
not
running.
he's
skipping
four
or
five
states.
mini
mike.
i've
had
him
up
to
here.
more
people
are
working
right
now
in
iowa
than
ever
before.
now
think
of
it.
think
of
it.
yesterday
we
replaced
a
nafta
disaster
with
the
incredible
brand
new
u.s.
mexico
canada
agreement.
the
"usmca,"
you
know
when
you
have
a
hard
time
with
that
"one,"
memory
is
a
great
thing.
i've
always
had
a
great
memory
for
whatever
"reason,"
but
memory
is
a
great
thing.
having
a
great
"memory,"
but
sometimes
you
take
little
clues.
usmca.
thank
"you,"
darling.
i
love
"you,"
too.
where
is
that
person
up?
look
at
that.
wow.
what
a
"good,"
strong
voice.
but
you
know
how
you
remember
it?
the
song
i
just
walked
in
on.
they're
playing
the
song
ymca.
"so,"
when
you're
having
a
hard
"time,"
"gee,"
what's
"u-s,"
just
think
of
the
song
"ymca,"
and
you'll
remember
"it,"
usmca.
it's
a
massive
win
for
iowa
farmers
and
workers
of
all
kinds.
it's
a
massive
win
and
it
creates
some
fairness
with
canada.
it
creates
fairness
with
mexico.
probably
the
biggest
reason
that
i
ran
was
the
unfair
trade
that
i've
"seen,"
and
one
after
"one,"
"china,"
"mexico,"
"canada,"
"japan,"
south
"korea,"
we've
made
all
these
"deals,"
and
we
have
plenty
left
over.
plenty
left
over.
"europe,"
"europe,"
europe
is
next.
i
wanted
to
finish
china
before
we
started
on
europe.
i
like
to
do
them
one
at
a
"time,"
one
at
a
time.
i'm
a
very
organized
person.
but
weeks
ago
we
also
signed
a
terrific
new
trade
agreement
with
china
that
will
boost
american
agriculture
by
$50
billion
every
"year,"
and
many
other
businesses
like
"manufacturing,"
"banking,"
"finance,"
overall
$250
"billion,"
and
you
know
with
the
"farmers,"
because
i
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
the
farmers
big.
i
went
and
i
saw
ambassador
lighthizer's
in
"charge,"
he's
fantastic.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
are
you
doing?
we're
getting
ready
for
the
final
deal.
what
are
you
"doing?\""
he
"said,"
"\"i'm"
putting
in
$20
"billion.\""
because
i
asked
sonny
perdue.
he's
great.
you
know
who
he
"is,"
right?
secretary
of
agriculture.
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
what's
the
biggest
number
that
china's
ever
done
with
the
"farmers?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
$16
billion
last
year.
$16
"billion.\""
this
was
two
years
ago.
i
"said,"
"\"so,"
$16
billion
is
the
"biggest,\""
because
you
"know,"
they
targeted
"you,"
and
now
we're
friends
with
china.
in
"fact,"
maybe
we've
never
had
a
better
relationship
and
were
working
with
them
very
closely
on
the
coronavirus.
we're
working
with
them
"very,"
very
closely.
we
only
have
five
people.
hopefully
everything's
going
to
be
great.
they
have
somewhat
of
a
"problem,"
but
hopefully
it's
all
going
to
be
great.
"but,"
we're
working
with
china
just
so
you
"know,"
and
other
countries
"very,"
very
"closely,"
so
it
doesn't
get
out
of
"hand,"
but
it's
something
that
we
have
to
be
"very,"
very
careful
"with,"
right?
we
have
to
be
very
careful.
but
i
said
to
sonny
"perdue,"
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
what's
the
"number?\""
16
and
12
the
year
"before,"
and
you
were
targeted.
i
don't
blame
china.
"look,"
they're
smart.
they're
negotiators.
they
targeted
trump
states.
where
do
they
love
trump?
they
love
him
in
iowa.
they
love
him
in
nebraska.
they
love
him
in
all
these
states.
they
love
him
in
wisconsin.
they
love
him.
we
won
wisconsin.
they
like
him
and
"wisconsin,"
and
a
lot
of
the
farm
"states,"
and
they
targeted.
the
farmers
came
to
see
me
and
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
you
have
to
do
what's
"right.\""
when
the
fake
news
would
interview
"farmers,"
the
farmers
would
"say,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
president
trump
is
doing
the
right
thing.
it
should
have
been
done
years
ago.
should've
been
done
years
and
years
"ago.\""
but
you
couldn't
have
made
it
because
there
was
too
much
"money,"
$16
billion.
"so,"
what
i
did
is
i
put
a
25%
tariff
on
everything
coming
in
from
"china,"
$250
"billion,"
and
then
more
tariffs
on
things
beyond
the
$250
billion
market.
we
took
in
"billions,"
and
"billions,"
and
billions
of
dollars.
we
still
"are,"
and
then
what
happened?
when
i
heard
about
the
farmers
and
i
saw
the
"farmers,"
they
were
in
the
white
house.
they
came
to
see
me.
i
had
36
farmers
and
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
give
"you.\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
don't
want
"anything.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
mean
you
don't
want
anything?
i've
never
heard
that
"before.\""
everybody
wants
money.
they
want
every.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
just
want
a
level
playing
"field.\""
i
never
forgot
it.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
don't
want
anything.
we
just
want
a
level
playing
"field,"
and
we've
been
treated
badly
for
"years,"
for
"years.\""
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
you
haven't
been
given
a
level
playing
field
for
"many,"
many
"years,"
for
decades.
you
haven't
been
given
a
level
playing
field.
we're
going
to
give
you
the
levelest
field
that
you
ever
had.
"but,"
but
in
the
"meantime,"
i'm
going
to
give
you
$12
"billion,"
out
of
these
tens
of
billions
that
we're
"collecting.\""
don't
worry.
we
had
plenty
of
left
"over,"
because
we
never
got
25
cents
from
china.
china
took
from
us.
we
didn't
take
from
"china,"
right?
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
give
you
$12
billion
for
the
year
"before,"
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
$16
billion
for
this
"year.\""
that
was
last
year
for
this
year.
"so,"
they
"got,"
meaning
"you,"
a
lot
of
you
in
this
"audience,"
got
$12
"billion,"
and
you
got
"16,"
so
you
got
$28
billion
over
that
short
period
of
"time,"
and
you
were
able
to
"actually,"
in
some
"cases,"
i
guess
thrive.
i
told
"sonny,"
"\"i"
want
to
take
care
of
the
small
farmer
"too,"
not
just
the
big
monsters.
i
want
to
take
care
of
"everyone,"
"everyone.\""
"but,"
i
never
forgot
when
cnn
fake
news
and
all
these
"people,"
they
go
around
interviewing
the
farmers.
they
could
never
find
anyone
saying
bad
about
trump.
they'd
go
into
diners.
"\"what"
do
you
think
about
trump?
isn't
it
a
terrible
what
he's
doing
with
the
"trade?\""
the
farmer
would
"say,"
"\"no,"
he's
doing
what
should
have
been
done
20
years
"ago.\""
"now,"
you
people
are
going
to
make
so
much
money.
you're
not
going
to
do
"just,"
you
know
what?
just
relax.
take
it
easy.
put
it
away.
enjoy
your
life.
but
you're
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money.
you're
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money.
"again,"
we
have
never
"had,"
because
they
respect
us
"now,"
they
didn't
respect
us.
we
have
never
had
a
better
relationship
with
china
than
we
do
right
now.
it's
a
beautiful
story.
they
respect
us.
the
whole
world
respects
us
now.
we're
respected
again.
america
is
respected
again.
okay?
we're
fighting
for
products
made
in
america
and
grown
right
here
in
this
"great,"
great
state
of
iowa.
to
keep
america
"safe,"
we
have
fully
rebuilt
the
united
states
military.
it's
now
"stronger,"
more
"powerful,"
more
lethal
than
ever
before.
we
have
all
brand
new
equipment
and
it
was
all
built
in
the
usa.
thanks
to
the
courage
of
american
"heroes,"
the
isis
caliphate
has
been
totally
destroyed
and
its
founder
and
"leader,"
the
animal
known
as
al-baghdadi
is
dead.
crazy
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
"\"don't"
call
him
an
animal.
he's
a
human
"being.\""
"no,"
he's
an
animal.
he's
an
animal.
two
weeks
"ago,"
at
my
"direction,"
the
united
states
military
delivered
another
historic
win
for
american
justice.
our
brave
warriors
launched
a
flawless
precision
strike
that
killed
the
world's
number
one
"terrorist,"
qasem
soleimani.
qasem
soleimani.
he
was
the
mastermind
of
the
road
side
bomb.
he
loved
roadside
bombs.
when
you
see
your
friends
and
great
soldiers
of
our
country
and
other
"countries,"
"frankly,"
walking
"around,"
they
don't
have
"legs,"
they
don't
have
arms
in
some
cases.
some
cases
they
don't
have
both.
you
see
them
walking
"around,"
or
riding
"around,"
or
the
most
brave
"people,"
these
people
have
the
greatest
attitude.
i
go
to
walter
reed
and
i
see
him
and
the
young
man
his
legs
were
blown
off.
"\"how"
you
"doing?\""
"\"sir,"
i
want
to
get
back.
i
want
to
get
"back,"
"sir.\""
i'll
tell
"you,"
the
spirit
of
these
"people,"
it
may
even
top
the
farmers.
it
may
even
top
the
"farmers,"
which
is
pretty
good.
but
he
was
"responsible,"
more
than
anybody
"else,"
90%
they
say
of
these
roadside
bombs
sent
to
fight
"us,"
he
was
responsible
and
he
took
a
hard
hit.
he
took
a
very
hard
hit.
he
was
responsible
for
murdering
and
maiming
thousands
and
thousands
of
"americans,"
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
people.
not
acceptable.
soleimani
was
actively
planning
new
"attacks,"
but
we
ended
his
bloody
rampage
forever.
"yet,"
washington
"democrats,"
"true,"
like
crazy
bernie
and
nancy
"pelosi,"
opposed
our
decision
to
eliminate
"soleimani,"
and
to
save
american
lives.
that
had
a
tremendous
impact.
while
we're
proudly
creating
jobs
and
killing
"terrorists,"
congressional
democrats
are
consumed
with
partisan
"rage,"
and
obsessed
with
a
deranged
witch
hunt
hoax.
you
"know,"
we're
having
probably
the
best
years
that
we've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
and
i
just
got
impeached.
can
you
believe
these
people?
i
got
impeached.
they
impeached
trump.
the
best
trade
"deals,"
the
strongest
"military,"
i
took
care
of
the
vets.
we
got
choice.
we
got
accountability
for
the
"vets,"
accountability.
we
got
all
these
things
and
they
impeach
your
president.
"no,"
that's
not
going
to
work.
"watch,"
just
watch.
they
want
to
nullify
your
"ballots,"
poison
our
"democracy,"
and
overthrow
the
entire
system
of
government.
that's
not
"happening,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
washington
democrats
have
spent
the
last
three
years
trying
to
overturn
the
last
election.
why
am
i
not
worried?
i
should
worried.
remember
"nixon,"
it
was
like
a
dark
"period,"
right?
it's
a
very
dark
period.
it
was
like
"oh,"
you
think
about
it.
right?
with
clinton
it
was
not
good.
they
say
that
with
"johnson,"
it
was
a
long
time
"ago,"
none
of
us
"remember,"
but
they
say
it
was
a
very
dark
period.
this
is
a
happy
period
for
us.
it's
a
happy
period.
it's
a
happy
period
because
we
call
this
impeachment
light.
this
is
light.
crazy
schiff.
shifty
schiff.
he's
a
sick
puppy.
he's
a
sick
puppy.
"but,"
you
know
what?
today
you
saw
"it,"
i
hit
my
highest
poll
numbers
since
i
got
elected
because
the
american
"people,"
and
"frankly,"
people
all
over
the
"world,"
know
it's
a
hoax.
they
understand
it.
they
know
it's
a
"hoax,"
and
we
have
a
great
"party,"
the
republican
party.
they
know
what's
going
on.
they
know
what's
going
on
and
they're
going
to
treat
us
very
fairly.
"but,"
the
democrats
are
trying
to
overturn
the
last
election.
we
will
make
sure
that
they
face
another
crushing
defeat
in
2020.
november
"3,"
november
"3,"
mark
it
off.
november
"3,"
mark
it
off.
was
that
a
great
day?
2016
november.
remember?
he's
not
going
to
do
well
with
this
group.
i
did
well.
he's
not
going
to
do
well
with
that
group.
i
won
that
group.
he's
not
going
to
do
well
here
or
there.
even
the
exit
"polls,"
they

it
right
up.
you
know
what
they
didn't
know
about
the
exit
polls?
when
people
are
"leaving,"
they're
always
very
accurate.

who
are
you
voting
for?
i'm
voting
for
"trump,"

trump.
they're
always
very
"accurate,"
but
this
time
something
happened.
many
"people,"
many…
i
like
that
idea.
i
like
it.
i
like
it.
wouldn't
we
like
to
run
against
her.
who's
tougher?
"her,"
crazy
"bernie,"
"biden,"
buttigieg?
who
would
be
the
closest?
buttigieg.
i
don't
know.
maybe
we
take
another
crack
at
crazy
hillary.
would
that
be
okay?
she
was
so
easy.
remember
that
speech
so
innocently
given
talking
about
deplorables.
remember?
remember
deplorables?
but
you
know
the
only
thing
i
didn't
"understand,"
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"terrible.\""
but
she
said
another
word
that
was
worse.
irredeemables.
i
"said,"
"\"boy,\""
shows
you
how
good
i
am
at
"politics,"
i
"said,"
"\"she's"
in
trouble.
she
said
our
people
are
"irredeemable.\""
to
me
that
was
worse.
"well,"
it
wasn't
that
word
that
caught
on.
it
was
deplorable.
the
next
day
i'm
"speaking,"
and
women
are
walking
"around,"
i'm
deplorable.
everyone's
got
deplorable.
i
"say,"
"\"i"
think
she
made
a
bad
speech
last
"night.\""
but
"irredeemable,"
remember?
she
called
them
deplorable
and
"irredeemable,"
and
me
being
so
"brilliant,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"

are
going

win
back

we
are
going

we
are
going

keep

this
is
a

of

i
just
left
"michigan,"
and
michigan
is
booming
now
because
of
"me,"

i
say
to
prime

he's
a
friend
of
"mine,"
"\"shinzo,\""

"\"you"

going

they're
coming

buying

i
ran
on
the
issue
trade.
i
ran
on
a
lot
of
different
"issues,"
but
trade
was
one
of
them.
that
was
so
big.
to
"me,"
it
was
so
big.
i
used
to
"say,"
how
do
we
allow
these
companies
to
"close,"
fire
"everybody,"
go
to
another
country?
"mexico,"
wherever
it
may
"be,"
make
"product,"
sell
the
product
into
our
"country,"
pay
no
tax.
who
the
hell
would
allow
this
to
happen?
who
would
allow
to
happen?
it's
like
in
south
korea.
i
went
to
"him,"
i
"said,"
"\"listen,"
your
deal
is
no
good.
we
have
to
make
a
new
"deal.\""
south
"korea,"
we're
protecting
them
"all,"
all
these
different
things.
i
"said,"
"\"number"
"one,"
you've
got
to
pay
us
"more.\""
they
agreed
to.
they
gave
us
$500
million
a
year
more.
they
"said,"
"\"but"
nobody
has
ever
"asked.\""
they
gave
us
500.
that's
nothing
compared
to
what
they
have
to
do.
that's
okay.
that's
okay.
they'll
pay
more.
but
you
"know,"
they
made
a
trade
deal
with
the
united
states.
hillary
clinton
was
in
charge
of
the
"deal,"
right?
she
said
it's
going
to
produce
"250,000"
"jobs,"
and
she
was
right.
"250,000."
you
know
who
it
was
for?
for
south
"korea,"
not
for
"us,"
it
was
for
south
korea.
"so,"
we
renegotiated
the
"deal,"
if
i
have
your
"permission,"
we
renegotiated
the
deal
and
now
we
have
a
good
deal
with
south
"korea,"
okay?
this
deal
is
going
to
"produce,"
remember…
this
deal
is
going
to
produce
"250,000"
jobs
for
south
korea.
she
didn't
lie.
can't
say
she
lied.
she
lies
about
a
lot
of
other
"things,"
but
she
didn't
lie.
how
is
she
taking
her
defeat?
okay?
i
think
so.
remember
the
debate?
do
you
promise
if
you
lose
that
you
will
support
the
winner
and
i
sort
"of,"
i
didn't
exactly
say
yes.
i
didn't
say
"yes,"
in
all
"fairness,"
but
i
got
sort
of
like
six
the
68%
there.
but
she
"said,"
"\"see"
he
"won't.\""
she's
the
one
that
doesn't
do
it.
"no,"
"no,"
i
feel
badly
because
it's
too
late
for
her
to
get
in.
i
kept
"hoping,"
but
i
"think,"
honestly
i
think
that
sleepy
"joe,"
crazy
"bernie,"
i
don't
even
want
to
put
buttigieg
"in,"
but
i
think
they'd
actually
be
tougher
than
her.
during
this
campaign
"season,"
the
good
people
of
iowa
have
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
lunacy
and
the
madness
of
the
totally
sick
left.
this
is
a
radical
left
people
that
we're
dealing
with.
today's
democrat
"party,"
i
don't
say
democratic
"party,"
it
sounds
so
much
better
in
a
"speech,"
right?
democratic
"party,"
the
"democrat,"
but
that's
not
their
name.
it's
called
the
democrat
party.
you
know
some
people
aren't
allowed
to
say
the
democrat
party
because
it
doesn't
sound
good.
i
don't
even
like
it.
i
don't
like
the
way
it
sounds
in
this
"speech,"
but
i'm
going
to
say
it
because
i'm
not
looking
to
have
them
look
good.
today's
democrat
party
is
run
by
left
wing
extremists
who
want
to
massively
raise
your
"taxes,"
increase
"regulations,"
cancel
your
health
"plans,"
raid
"medicare,"
shut
down
american
"energy,"
destroy
your
social
"security,"
they
will
destroy
your
social
"security,"
eliminate
religious
"liberty,"
punish
free
"speech,"
confiscate
your
"guns,"
abolish
your
"borders,"
and
indoctrinate
america's
children
with
"hateful,"
left-wing
ideology.
other
than
"that,"
they're
okay.
other
than
"that,"
they're
fine
people.
in
"short,"
this
election
is
a
choice
between
american
freedom
and
democratic
"socialism,"
and
in
some
"cases,"
in
my
"opinion,"
it's
worse
than
socialism.
socialism's
a
kind
word
by
comparison.
the
democrats
will
lose
because
america
will
never
be
a
socialist
country.
we
can't.
they're
all
watching
tonight.
they're
sitting
in
their
hotel
"room,"
little
hotels
right
down
the
"street,"
and
they're
looking
at
this
crowd.
the
press
never
talks
about
my
crowds.
did
you
see
in
new
jersey
a
couple
of
nights
ago?
we
had
signups
for
"175,000"
people.
we
had
an
arena
that
held
about
"9,000"
people.
we
could
have
sold
it
out
15
times.
okay?
they
don't
talk
about
that.
you
know
what
they
talk
about?
they
said
donald
trump
who
spoke
before
a
nice
crowd.
if
bernie
or
sleepy
joe
"has,"
i
mean
joe
had
a
crowd
that
was
so
small
the
other
day
that
they
set
up
a
round
table.
"no,"
it's
true.
"no,"
they
were
in
a
gymnasium.
there
were
in
a
"gymnasium,"
and
they
set
up
a
round
"table,"
and
people
that
went
there
to
hear
his
speech
are
now
being
"asked,"
"\"what"
do
you
think
of
"socialism?\""
they
just
"said,"
"\"i"
just
want
to
be
here
to
watch
his
"speech.\""
they
set
up
a
round-
they
just
"said,"
"\"i"
just
want
to
be
here
to
watch
a
"speech.\""
they
set
up
a
round
table
because
the
crowd
was
so
"small,"
and
then
they'll
"say,"
"\"it"
was
a
brilliant
round
table.
it
was
"wonderful.\""
they
never
mention
crowds.
they
never
mention
crowds.
they
never
mention
anything.
i'll
tell
"you,"
"u.s.m.c.a,"
the
biggest
trade
deal
ever
signed
in
the
history
of
the
world.
okay?
it
"is,"
wait.
it
barely
got
any
mention.
we
signed
it.
it
barely
got
any
mention.
they
talk
about
the
impeachment
hoax.
they
talk
about
all
the
other
"stuff,"
but
the
trade
"deal,"
that
is
going
to
change
our
country.
it's
going
to
bring
growth.
wait
until
you
"see,"
toward
the
end
of
next
"year,"
the
growth
will
be
astronomical
because
of
the
china
trade
"deal,"
the
"u.s.m.c.a,"
"japan,"
south
"korea,"
"europe,"
when
that
happens.
it
will
happen
because
they
have
no
choice.
they
have
no
choice.
but
in
the
"papers,"
and
on
the
fake
news
cable
"shows,"
and
the
"regular,"
"look,"
nbc
is
"horrible,"
the
nbc
nightly
"news,"
it's
terrible.
the
good
news
is
people
don't
watch
it
like
they
used
"to,"
because
they
don't
believe
in
it.
they
don't
believe
in
it.
and
as
sean
hannity
would
"say,"
"msdnc,"
you
know
what
msdnc
"is,"
"right,"
so
bad.
"cnn,"
total
fake
stuff.
"oops,"
their
camera
just
went
off.
look!
the
camera
just
went
off!
cnn!
their
camera
just
went
off.
that
always
happens
whenever
i
say
"cnn,"
their
camera
goes
off.
but
"americans,"
across
the
political
"spectrum,"
were
disgusted
by
the
washington
"democrats,"
the
partisan
"hoaxes,"
the
witch
"hunts,"
the
con
jobs.
it's
all
a
con
job.
and
"so,"
they
don't
love
our
"country,"
i
swear
they
don't.
you
look
at
nancy
pelosi's
district
in
san
francisco.
it
was
so
"beautiful,"
and
now
it's
a
"disgrace,"
being
watched
all
over
the
world.
needles
all
over
the
"place,"
everything
else
all
over
the
place.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
"it,"
washing
down
into
the
"ocean,"
washing
down
onto
their
"beaches,"
people
living
in
tents
if
they're
lucky.
i
mean
you
never
saw
"anything,"
living
on
their
most
important
entryways
into
what
was
a
great
"city,"
san
francisco.
what's
happened?
and
all
she
does
is
work
on
the
hoax
and
work
on
all
of
the
stuff.
"really,"
these
people
are
"very,"
very
bad
for
our
country.
we
have
to
take
back
the
house
of
"representatives,"
we
have
to.
registered
democrats
and
independents
are
leaving
the
democrat
party
in
"droves,"
and
we
are
welcoming
these
"people,"
and
these
great
"voters,"
to
the
republican
party
with
"wide,"
open
arms.
and
we
are
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
a
lot
of
your
great
"leaders,"
a
lot
of
your
really
wonderful
people.
i'm
not
going
to
mention
all
the
"names,"
because
all
those
cameras
that
are
"rolling,"
they
don't
like
it
when
i
do
"it,"
but
one
they
don't
mind
is
governor
kim
reynolds.
come
"up,"
"kim,"
come
up
here!
also
first
"gentleman,"
kevin
"reynolds,"
kevin!
"kim,"
come
"on,"
come
on.
you
want
to
say
something?
"great,"
great
job.
thank
you.
"oh,"
she
was
driving
me
a
little
bit
batty.
she
would
call
me
"up,"
"kim,"
you
would
call.
"\"what"
about
"ethanol?\""
i
said
"kim,"
"\"i"
"mean,"
i'm
doing
a
lot
for
that
"place.\""
"\"no,"
no.
we
want
"ethanol.\""
"then,"
"\"we"
want
"biofuel.\""
then
she
is
asking
for
things
i
never
even
heard
"of,"
but
we
got
them
"all,"
whatever
that
hell
she
"wanted,"
we
got.
right?
and
by
the
"way,"
joni
ernst
and
the
great
chuck
grassley
are
right
now
in
washington
fighting
for
"fairness,"
fighting
the
"hoax,"
fighting
for
all
of
us.
they
"called,"
they
"said,"
"\"do"
you
mind
if
we
don't
go
tonight?
we
have
to
"stay.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
want
you
to
be
there.
i
want
you
to
be
where
you
"are\""
because
they
are
fighting
for
us.
they
are
great
people.
they
are
great
people.
"and,"
they
would
call
too.
chuck
"grassley,"
joni

they
would
"call,"
"\"we"
got
to

you

they
all
"say,"
"\"how"
did
you
do
"it?\""
"and,"
the
truth
is
we
have
certain

we
also
have
a

we
have
the
greatest
people
in

i
really
mean
that.

remember
it.
for
"decades,"
politicians
ran
for
"office,"
promising
to
protect
american
farmers
and
workers.
you've
heard
it
all
your
"lives,"
right?
but
"then,"
they
went
to
washington.
they
looked
at
those
beautiful
marble
"columns,"
and
that
gorgeous
ceiling
"painted,"
and
all
that
"gold,"
the
way
they
used
to
build
the
"buildings,"
they
don't
build
them
that
way
anymore.
we
"could,"
but
they
just
don't
know
how.
by
the
"way,"
we're
building
the
wall.
you
know
the
wall
is
over
a
hundred
miles
long.
it's
over
a
hundred
miles
long
already
and
moving
fast.
they
went
to
washington
and
they
sold
you
out.
that's
what
happened.
they
sold
your
jobs
out.
they
sold
everything
out.
globalist
politicians
allowed
other
countries
to
raid
our
"factories,"
ravage
our
"farms,"
rob
our
"workers,"
and
ransack
our
communities.
but
the
era
of
economic
surrender
is
"over,"
because
now
we
are
finally
putting
america
"first,"
america
first.
before
i
took
"office,"
washington
looked
the
other
"way,"
while
china
stole
our
secrets
from
american
agriculture.
your
"business,"
what
they
do
"scientifically,"
nobody
understands
what
they
have
done
to
a
seed.
it
doesn't
sound
complicated.
it
is
"genius,"
what
they
have
been
able
to
"do,"
what
you
have
been
able
to
do.
but
those
secrets
were
being
"stolen,"
stolen.
and
installed
massive
barriers
to
your
exports.
you
couldn't
do
anything
with
"exports,"
so
"people,"
not
only
"china,"
"many,"
many
other
places
were
stealing
your
secrets.
our
new
agreement
with
china
will
protect
our
intellectual

and
pry
open
vast
new
markets
for
american
"beef,"
"pork,"
"poultry,"
"seafood,"
"soybeans,"
"rice,"
"dairy,"
and
"much,"
much
more.
but
you
know
it
is
true.
china
is
so
big.
1.5
billion
people.
we
have
350.
1.5
billion
"people,"
think
of
"that,"
and
we
are
just
touching
it.
this
deal
will
be
so
big.
if
it
all
works
"out,"
and
you
have
the
best
"product,"
the
best
product
in
the
"world,"
if
it
all
works
"out,"
it
will
just
keep
expanding.
250
billion
will
end
up
being
"much,"
much
more
than
that.
"and,"
i've
told
this
story
"before,"
when
we
were
"signing,"
we
were
almost
finished
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much
are
the
farmers
"getting?\""
meaning
how
much
are
they
going
to
purchase
from
the
farmers.
and
ambassador
lighthizer
"said,"
"\"we"
put
20
"billion,"
sir.
the
highest
ever
was
"16,"
so
we
made
it
"20.\""
i
said
"\"make"
it
"50.\""
they
"said,"
"\"what?\""
and
then
"people,"
even
farm
"people,"
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
can't
produce
that
"much.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
good
"problem,"
not
a
bad
"problem.\""
i
"said,"
"\"make"
it
"50,\""
so
we
now
"have,"
in
the
"contract,"
from
40
to
$50

worth
of
"purchase.\""
make
it
"50,"
make
it
50!
"right,"
jared?
i
"said,"
"\"jared,"
you
better
make
it
"50.\""
i
want
those
farmers
to
come
"back,"
"say,"
"\"sir,"
"sir,"
we
can't
do
it.
we
can't
produce
that
"much,"
"sir,"
what
are
you
doing
to
"us?\""
i
don't
think
that
would
ever
happen?
do
you

that
would
"ever,"
i
said
they
will
figure
a
way.
he's
going
"\"absolutely"
"not.\""
"nah,"
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
make
it
"20,"
make
it
"50.\""
the
u.s.m.c.a.
is
another
colossal
victory
for
american
agriculture
like
you
have
never
had
before.
it's
time.
we
suffered
for
a
year
and
a
"half,"
almost
two
years.
think
of
"it,"
but
not
really
because
i
was
able
to
give
you
"those,"
i
won't
call
them
subsidies.
i
made
that
mistake
once
with
the
farmers.
i
said
to
this
group
of
farmers
that
came
"in,"
"\"subsidy.\""
i
used
the
word
subsidy.
that
was
the
worst
"word,"
"\"sir,"
we
don't
watch
subsidy!
please
don't
ever
use
that
"word.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
"won't,"
i
"promise.\""
just
in
that
"small,"
little
grouping
where
you
were
doing
nothing.
it's
called
promises
"made,"
promises
kept.
promises
met.
the
last
time
i
"came,"
i
never
did
this
"before,"
i
never
"ran,"
so
they
all
"said,"
"\"you"
never
ran
before.
you
can't
do
this
if
you
never
"ran,\""
so
whatever
"happened,"
it
happened.
one
by
"one,"
they
started
dropping
"out,"
right?
and
then
i
was
left
with
"one,"
hillary
"clinton,"
and
that
worked
out
very
nicely.
"\"he"
cannot
get
to

"\"he"
cannot
get
to

i
went
to

it's
"true,"
"maine,"

it's
got
one
"point,"
"right,"
one.
i
went
there
a

many
times.
everyone
"said,"
"well,"
they
kept
getting
"me,"
maybe
if
i
have
a
great
"night,"
"269,"
but
269

right?
but
we
got
306
to
223.
"306,"
"223,"
so
they
were
"right,"
"\"you"
cannot
get
to
"270,"
you
can
get
to
"306,\""
but
not
that
there
is…
in
the
eight
years
before
my
"election,"
net
farm
income
plummeted
by
"20%,"
you
know
that.
if
you
look
at
a
"chart,"
for
15
years
"actually,"
not
"eight,"
for
15
"years,"
it's
like
a
roller
coaster
ride
down
for
the
farmer.
soybeans.
take
a
look
at
it
all.
it
was
just
a
one
way
street.
everybody
was
ripping
off
the
american
farmer.
now
you're
going
to
see
numbers
that
are
going
to
be
great.
look
at
even
what's
happened
recently.
it's
incredible
what's
going
on
and
i
love
"it,"
because
you
deserve
it.
you
suffered
a
"lot,"
with
people
that
were
stupid.
they
were
stupid!
under
three
years
of
my
"administration,"
net
farm
income
has
already
gone
up
nearly
50%
and
will
now
be
rising
even
faster.
what
are
you
going

do?
you
are
going

you
are
going

here
i
am
on
the

"\"well,"
net

has
gone
up
for
the
farmers
"50%.\""
tell
"me,"
how
the
hell
do
i
lose
this
debate?
how
do
i
lose?
and
based
on
the
"polls,"
i
guess
i'm
not
going
to
lose
in
this
state.
i
don't
think
i
will
lose
in
any
other
state
either.
because
this
is
really
true
all
over
the
country.
this
is
happening
all
over
the
"country,"
not
just
iowa.
on
no
issue
have
washington
democrats
more
thoroughly
betrayed
the
american
people
than
on
immigration.
illegal
immigration
costs
our
nation
hundreds
of
billions
of
"dollars,"
drains
public
"services,"
overcrowds
our
schools
and
"hospitals,"
and
threatens
innocent
american
lives
at
a
number
that
you
wouldn't
even
believe.
but
we
have
got
it
closed
"up,"
but
we're
getting
your
people
in.
you
have
people
that
have
worked
for
you
for
a
long
"time,"
don't
you?
i
know
who
the

that
you
"have,"

they
are

we
have
a

you
have
a
lot
of
great
people
out
there.
right
here
in
des
"moines,"
a
twice
"deported,"
illegal
alien
was
charged
with
shooting
and
killing
a
"woman,"
her
11-year-old
"daughter,"

her
five-year-old
son.
in

charged
or
convicted
of
heinous
"crimes,"
including
"robbery,"
"rape,"
and
murder.
yet
today's
democrat
party
glorifies
illegal
immigration.
we
have
no
"idea,"
now
we
do
"now,"

people
would
come
in
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands.
we
have
no
idea
who
they
are.
many
are
fine
people
and
all
of
"that,"

some
are

"murderers,"

people
that
their
countries
don't
"want,"
"guatemala,"
"honduras,"
el
"salvador,"
and
even
mexico.
right
now
we
have
a
love
affair
with
mexico
because
the
"democrats,"
the
democrats
wouldn't
give
us
what
we
needed
and
i
got
"mexico,"
they're
great.
they
put
up
"27,000"
soldiers
on
our
southern
border
and
the
numbers
are
"plummeting,"
87%
down.
the
president
of

is
doing
a
great
job.
and
we
ended

you
think
that
was
easy?

"release,"
you
know
what
catch

is?
you
catch

you
take

today's
democrat

glorifies
illegal
"immigration,"
vilifies
the
heroes
of

to
dissolve

some

some

in

i
came
up
with

they
won't
give

we
are
throwing

remember
the

"\"you"

don't

you
don't

seven
years
they
all
voted
for

they
just
didn't
have
the

build

you
know
it's
not
easy

and
"this,"
and
"that,"
and

they
couldn't
figure
it
out

i
can
figure
it
out.
the
problem
was
we
couldn't
get
the

we
got
all
the

we
need
now.
we
have

we
have
everything.
the

this

they
didn't
really
fight

know
why?

they
learned
it's
a
really
bad

for

i
made
one
mistake
with
the

i
should
have
"said,"
"\"we"

never

they
would
have
given
me
so
much
money
to
build
a

that
was
my
only
…
because
i
used
to
"go,"
"\"we"
will
build

that
was
a
mistake.
i
should
have
"said,"
"\"we"
will

they
would
have
forced
its

would
have

they
"said,"

we
could
have

oh
what
are
you
going

do
with

when
people
are
going
through

they're
going

flying

have

the

are

"honestly,"
that
poor

is
so
lost.
they
talk
"healthcare,"
she
"said,"
"\"it's"
over
for
"him.\""
it
was
over
for
"him,"
actually
if
you
knew
"him,"
a
long
time
ago.
now
it's
really
over.
we
are
making
healthcare
better
and
cheaper.
we
got
rid
of
the
individual
"mandate,"
the
most
unpopular
"thing,"
which
essentially
killed
obamacare.
we
are
protecting
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
we
always
"will,"
the
republican
party.
we're
stopping
surprise
medical
billing
and
making
everything
totally
transparent.
i
signed
it
already.
everything
now
is
going
to
"transparencies,"
where
"hospitals,"
"doctors,"
everybody
has
to
tell
you
how
much
things
are
costing.
watch
those
prices
come
down.
right?
right?
i
have
an
expert
on
healthcare.
he
said
transparency
because
it's
a
big
deal.
it's
a
big
deal.
nobody
else
would
have
gotten
it
"done,"
that
i
can
tell
you.
transparency
is
bigger
than
healthcare
because
you
will
see
prices
tumbling
like
you
wouldn't
believe.
people
go
in
for
a
blood
"test,"
they
get
charged
"$2,700."
down
the
road
they
get
the

test
for
$57.
the
same
exact
test.
maybe
it's
better.
maybe
it's
better.
it's
crazy.
when
you
have
transparency
it's
all
going
to
come.
you
watch.
you
watch.
but
this
"person,"
a
real
"expert,"
"said,"
"\"this"
is
bigger
than
"healthcare,\""
and
i
got
it
done.
unfortunately
it
won't
really
start
kicking
in
until
after
the
election
because
it
takes
a
period
of
time.
they
have
certain
statutory
"requirements,"
et
cetera.
well
you
better
let
me
win.
can
you
imagine?
can
you
imagine?
i
did
"transparency,"
i
took
the
"guts,"
i
did
transparency
and
then
i'm
going
to
watch
as
somebody
else
"says,"
"\"didn't"
he
do
a
great
job
for
"transparency?\""
you
better
let
me
win
because
i
want
the
credit
for
that
one.
we're
buying
cheaper
drugs

approving

ever
before.

defending

are
defending

can
keep

28
times
he
lied.
we
should
impeach
him.
"no,"
he
got
it
on
a
lie.
he
got
it
on
a
"lie,"
but
we've
run
it
much
better.
but
essentially
it's
totally
different
because
of
individual
mandate.
because
that
really
took
the
guts
out
of
it
and
we're
running
it
much
better.
i
had
a
"choice,"
do
we
run
it
well
or
do
we
run
it
poorly?
if
we
run
it
poorly
everyone's
going
to
blame
me.
if
we
run
it
well
everyone's
going
to
give
him
"credit,"
especially
the
fakers
back
there
right?
but
you
know
what?
we
got
to
run
it
well
but
we're
coming
up
with
a
healthcare
that
if
we
win
the
house
we
will
have
the
best
healthcare
of
any
country
in
the
"world,"
by
far.
we're
fighting
the
lobbyists
and
we're
fighting
the
special
"interest,"
in
case
you
didn't
notice.
we
are
serving
only
you.
thanks
to
our
bold
reforms
we're
now
offering
health
plans
that
are
60%
cheaper
than
obamacare.
we're
offering
a
lot
of
different
things.
we
have
just
"passed,"
"recently,"
10
months
"ago,"
right
to
try.
i
love
right
to
try.
you
know
what
that
is?
that's
people
are
terminally
ill
and
they
can't
use
medicine
because
…
they've
been
trying
to
pass
"this,"
almost
for
50
years.
you
can't
use
the
medicine.
we
have
the
greatest
"doctors,"
"labs,"
hospitals
in
the
world.
they
come
up
with
a
medicine
but
it
has
to
go
through
the
fda
"procedure,"
right?
you
can't
do
anything.
you
can't
use
it.
they
won't
let
you
use
it.
now
i
have
you
sign
an
"agreement,"
you're
not
going
to
sue
the
united
"states,"
you're
not
going
to
"this,"
your
"family,"
et
"cetera,"
et
cetera.
very
simple.
and
they
can
use
it.
you
have
no
idea
the
results
that
are
taking
place.
you
have
no
idea.
you
have
no
idea
the
results.
people's
lives
are
being
…
for
me
it
was
simple.
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
you're
worried
about
hurting
somebody?
these
people
are
dying.
they're
terminally
ill.
they're
admitting
they're
terminally
ill
and
you
won't
let
them
use
a
drug
that
may
work?
let
the
use
the
"drug.\""
and
we're
letting
them
use
the
drug
and
it's
working
in
a
lot
of
cases.
we
have
transformed
veterans
"healthcare,"
including
va
choice.
the
best.
you
know
i
think
i'm
a
totally
brilliant
human
being.
i
think
i'm
the
smartest
"person,"
so
i
came
up
with
a
plan.
i'll
never
"forget,"
i
was
in
new
"hampshire,"
i
came
up
with
this
idea
because
everybody
kept
coming
up
to
me
and
"saying,"
"\"sir"
it's
really
terrible
what's
happening
with
healthcare.
we're
waiting
in
line
for
two
"weeks,"
for
four
"weeks,"
for
seven
"weeks.\""
honestly
people
were
waiting
in
"line,"
they
weren't
very
"sick,"
they
were
terminally
"ill,"
"truthfully,"
before
they
saw
a
doctor.
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
doctor.
so
i
came
up
with
this
incredible
plan.
only
i
could
think
of
this.
i
"said,"
"\"here's"
what
you
do
…
here's
what
you
"do,"
if
somebody
can't
get
a
doctor
"quickly,\""
because
we
have
great
doctors
at
the
va.
they
don't
get
enough
credit.
"\"if"
you
can't
get
to
a
doctor
quickly
you
go
"outside,"
you
go
"locally,"
you
get
a
"doctor,"
we
pay
the
"bill,"
you
get
yourself
all
"better.\""
right?
so
i
went
back.
i
went
back
and
i
told
my
"people,"
"\"do"
you
have
any
idea
how
smart
i
am?
listen
to
this
plan
i
"have.\""
they
"said,"
"\"actually"
sir
we've
known
about
that
plan
for
52
years
we
just
couldn't
get
it
"approved.\""
so
i
"said,"
"\"oh"
that's
too
"bad,"
i
thought
it
was
"brilliant,\""
but
what
i
am
good
at
is
getting
things
approved
and
i
got
it
approved.
people
are
using
it
and
it's
great.
i
know
the
people
of
iowa
don't
care
about
this
but
we
are
making

we
are
combating
the
opioid
epidemic.
drug
overdose
deaths
have
declined
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
31
years.
that's
a
great
thing.
our
great
first
lady
is
helping
us
with
that.
that
is
such
a
big
thing
for
melania.
"big,"
big
thing.
she
is
really
involved.
we
will
never
let
the
democrats
give
away
your
healthcare
to
illegal
"immigrants,"
especially
when
we
"say,"
"\"come"
in.
come
"in,"
we'll
give
you
"healthcare.\""
it's
one
thing
they
come
in
and
it's
a
rough
situation
because
we
all
have
hearts
but
when
people
are
"saying,"
like
in
california
this
wacky
governor
he
"says,"
"\"come"
"in,"
we're
going
to
give
you
healthcare.
we're
going
to
give
you
free
education.
we're
going
to
give
you
everything.
we're
going
to
give
you
a
beautiful
"rolls-royce.\""
see
to
show
you
how
fake
they
are
one
of
the
newscasters
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
said
that
the
governor
of
california
promised
a
rolls-royce
to
illegal
immigrants.
he
didn't
promise
them.
this
was
a
lie
and
a
misrepresentation
by
president
"trump.\""
they
can't
take
a
little
humor.
they
can't
take
it.
these
people
are
sick.
they're
sick.
no.
they're
sick
people.
them
and
shifty
schiff
is
a
very
sick
person.
he
lies
awake
at
night
shifting
and
"turning,"
shifty.
shifting
and
turning
in
his
"bed,"
sweating
like
a
dog.
"\"how"
am
i
going
to
get
him?
he
didn't
do
anything
"wrong,"
how
am
i
going
to
get
"him?\""
oh
what
a
sick
guy
he
is.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
abortion.
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
womb.
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
that
is
why
i
have
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
no
matter
how
you
cut
"it,"
that's
what
it
is.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
the
late
great
abraham
lincoln.
you
know
"that,"
right?
abraham
lincoln.
honest
abe.
remember
i
always
"said,"
"\"i"
can
be
more
presidential
than
any
other
past
"president,"
other
than
perhaps
abraham
lincoln
when
he's
wearing

right?
because
it's
easy
to
be

only
have
about
three

in

"\"good"
evening

is
everything
okay
in

oh
i
"see,"
the
world
is
ripping
you
off.
well
there's
not
a
thing
i
can
do
about
that.
thank
you.
good
night

good

"no,"
we
got
to
do
it
the
right
way.
republicans
…
and
by
the
"way,"
can
i
be
honest?
doing
this
takes
far
more
talent
than
doing
that.
doing
that
is
very
easy.
this
is
not
easy.
especially
when
you
just
left
"michigan,"
and
you
just
left
other
"places,"
and
you
got
maniacs
doing
a
number
on
you
all
the
time
for
three
years.
you
got
the
maniacs
for
three
years.
i
think
before
i
came
down
the
escalator
with
our
future
first
lady
i
think
really
they
were
doing
it
then.
they
started
even
before
i
came
down
on
the
escalator.
these
people
are
"maniacs,"
so
you
have
all
that.
so
you're
fighting
that
and
you're
doing
farm
bills.
we
got
your
farm
bill
approved
by
the
way.
we
got
your
farm
bill
approved.
i
don't
even
mention
that
because
that's
massive
by
any
other
"standard,"
but
it's
peanuts
compared
to
the
usmca
and
the
china
"deal,"
right?
so
i
don't
even
mention
it.
"anyway,"
republicans
are
fighting
for
citizens
from
every
background
and
from
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
it's
true.
our
numbers
with
african
american
"workers,"
"people,"
are
through
the
roof.
are
through
the
roof
because
…
remember
i
used
to
"say,"
"\"what"
do
you
have
to
"lose?\""
i'd
read
the
down
the
worst
on
"crime,"
the
worst
on
education.
they
got
"this,"
they
got
"that,"
they
got
10
different
"things,"
all
horrible.
one
day
i'm
in
front
of
this
tremendous
group
of
people
and
i'm
reading
this
"list,"
african

they
have
the
highest

i
"said,"
"\"stay"
with

because
they
were
with
the

for
a
hundred

"said,"
"\"stay"

what
the
hell
do
you
have
to
"lose?\""
you
know
what?

know
what?
remember
that?
now
they
have
the
best

"numbers,"
they
have
the
best

"numbers,"
they
have
numbers
that
nobody
would

they're
doing
so
great.
it's
so
great
to
see
it.
it's
incredible.

american

it's
been
great.
we're
asking
all
americans
to
join
our
incredible
movement.
we
are
a
big
tent
and
a
big
party
with
"big,"
"bold,"
beautiful
ideas
for
the

we're
what
the
country
was
based
on
originally.
it
was
called

during

we
continue
our
fight
to
rescue

in

iowa
became
one
of
the
first
states
to
pass
school

that
was
over
10
years

now
governor
"reynolds,"

more
than
100

are
supporting
our
plan

it's
a

of

we
had
a

of

wanted

we
had

wanted

they
couldn't
get
it
passed.

couldn't
even
come
close.
he
didn't
try

hard.
he
talked
"like,"
"\"oh"
i'll
"try.\""
to
uphold
the
rule
of

we
have
confirmed

will
interpret

as

and
two
great
supreme
court
"justices,"
by
the
way.
as
part
as
…
right?
two
great
ones.
as
part
of
my
commitment
to
rebuild
our
military
we
secured
an
$8.5
million
facility
to
support

we
take

i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
we
recognized

sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
yesterday
we
just
released
a
historic
new
plan
for
peace.
we're
going
to
see
if
we
can
get
that
done.
it's
one
of
the
toughest
deals
of
all.
one
of
the
toughest
deals
but
we
have
a
shot
at
it.
for
years
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
our
country.
they
apologized.
they
would
"say,"
"\"i'm"
"sorry.\""
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
people
of
iowa.
we
are
standing
up
for
iowa.
at
stake
in
our
present
battle
is
the
"survival,"
"frankly,"
of
our
nation.
"look,"
i
can
make
this
speech
really
short.
all
i
have
to
do
is
"say,"
"\"hello"
"iowa,"
you
have
no
choice.
you
have
to
vote
for
me.
otherwise
everything
that
you've
built
in
your
entire
life
will
be
gone.
goodbye
"iowa,"
have
a
good
"time.\""
instead
i
work
my
ass
off
up
"here,"
okay?
yeah.
true.
do
you
think
this
is
easy?
it's
a
little
hot
in
this
room.
this
room
wasn't
designed
for
this
many
people.
if
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
blessings
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
and
died
for
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
in
november
of
2020.
we
have
to.
by
the
"way,"
for
those
beautiful
farmers
that
want
to
leave
your
small
farms
or
businesses
to
your
children
…
because
of
our
great
tax
"bill,"
the
biggest
tax
cut
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
the
biggest
that
you
benefit
by.
because
of
that
there
is
no
death
tax
or
inheritance
"tax,"
as
they
call
it.
so
i
always
"say,"
"\"if"
you
love
your
children
that's
a
great
thing.
if
you
don't
love
your
children
don't
leave
it
to
them
and
that
particular
tax
won't
"matter,\""
but
if
you
love
…
is
there
anybody
here
that
does
not
love
your
children?
is
there
anybody
here
who
loves
your
children?
well
it's
iowa.
it's
iowa.
you
love
your
children.
you
know
you
have
no
tax
to
"pay,"
you
leave
your
...
"no,"
it's
great.
so
when
you're
looking
down
at
your
children
you're
"saying,"
"\"oh"
did
you
get
lucky?
did
you
get
lucky?
look
at
"them,"
they're
enjoying
"life.\""
but
only
this
way
can
we
save
the
america
we
love
and
drain
the
washington
swamp
once
and
for
all.
that
swamp
is
bad.
that
swamp
is
bad.
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
to
be
this
sick
and
this
degenerated.
it's
a
degenerate
swamp.
i
had
no
idea.
when
i
came
"out,"
i
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
drain
this
"swamp.\""
i
had
no
idea
that
the
swamp
was
that
"evil,"
but
we're
winning.
we're
winning
because
we're
in
the
white
house.
we're
winning.
with
your
help
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependents
to
"independents,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
that's
what's
happening
all
over
our
country.

will
elect

create

"safe,"

going
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
want
to
make
it.
but
they've
been
very
nice.
and
today
i
got
a
call
from
one
of
the
top
"representatives,"
he
"said,"
"\"congratulations,"
mr.
"president,"
on
having
a
truly
"great,"
great
"economy.\""
that's
pretty
nice.
we
picked
"up,"
since
the
"election,"
trillions
of
dollars
in
value.
and
china
has
lost
trillions
of
dollars
in
value.
i
will
say
"this,"
if
our
opponent
had
won
that
"election,"
you
know
what
would
have
happened?
right
now
china
would
become
the
…
it
would
be
the
number
one
economy
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
right
now
i
can
tell
you
they're
not
even
close.
our
country
is
stronger
than
ever
before
because
we
are
proudly
"putting,"
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
"time,"
we
are
putting
america
first.

loves

our
bold
pursuit
of
this
pro-american
agenda
has
"enraged,"
and
you
know
what's
"happened,"
it's
enraged
the
failed
ruling
class
in
washington.
not
easy
to
get
them
"out,"
but
we're
doing
it
"slowly,"
but
surely.
these
corrupt
politicians
and
the
radical
leftists
got
rich
bleeding
america
dry.
and
they
knew
that
my
election
would
finally
end
their
pillaging
and
looting
of
our
country.
and
that's
what
they
were
doing.
and
that's
what
they
continue
to
try
and
do.
that
is
"why,"
from
day
"one,"
the
wretched
washington
swamp
has
been
trying
to
nullify
the
results
of
a
truly
great
and
democratic
"election,"
the
election
of
2016.
they're
trying.
they're
not
getting
very
far.
they
want
to
erase
your
vote
like
it
never
existed.
they
want
to
erase
your
voice.
and
they
want
to
erase
your
future.
but
they
will
"fail,"
because
in
"america,"
the
people
rule
again.
do
you
remember
"that,"
just
19
minutes
after
i
raised
my
hand
and
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
the
washington
"post,"
a
terrible
newspaper
that
doesn't
know
how
to
write

in

they
might've
gotten
it
pretty

they
"said,"
"\"the"

was

13

they

to

"fast,"
because
they're
not

look

that's

they

maybe

if

there's

if
you

there's

because
it's

i
can

it's

"\"give"

right?
"no,"
this
is
the
worst.
these
people
and

they're

it's
a

how
about
on

like
the

"\"tonight,"

all
of
a
sudden
every

is
using

it's
a
talking
point
given
to
these
fakers
by
the
democrats.
so
they
know
they
can't
win
the
2020
"election,"
so
they're
pursuing
the
insane
impeachment
witch
hunt.
i've
been
going
through
it
now
for
more
time
than
i've
been
in

"because,"
like
strzok
with
his
insurance
"deal,"
this
was
"before,"
remember
"this,"
this
was
"before,"
that
statement
was
made
months
before
i
took
office.
that
statement
was
made
months
before
the
election
took
place.
they
"said,"
"\"just"
in
"case,"
we're
going
to
have
an
insurance
"policy.\""
that
only
means
one
"thing,"
"\"we're"
going
to
get
him
"out.\""
so
they're
telling
us.
we
can't
let
that
ever
happen
again
to
another
president.
and
rush
"limbaugh,"
sean
"hannity,"
a
lot
of

the
great

we
have
a
lot
of

lou

great
people.
you
know
what
they
said?
every
one
of
"them,"
plus
many
"others,"
"\"there's"
no
other
man
that
we've
ever
met
that
could
have
taken
"it.\""
it's
true.
maybe
i'm
a
little
different
up
here.
i
don't
know.
but
i
enjoy
it.
to
"me,"
i'm
energized
because
we're
draining
the
swamp.
the
democrats'
brazen
attempt
to
overthrow
our
government
will
produce
a
backlash
at
the
ballot
box
the
likes
of
which
they
have
never
ever
seen
before
in
the
history
of
this
country.
these
are
bad
people.
my
phone
"call,"
as
an
"example,"
with
the
president
of
"ukraine,"
was
perfect.
everybody
that
looked
at
it.
and
the
only
reason
i
released
it
was
that
the
democrats
put
out
a
phony
narrative.
so
i
had
no
choice.
and
i
don't
want
to
do
that
as
"president,"
every
time
a
president
from
a
country
calls
"me,"
or
i
call
"them,"
we
have
to
release
the
text.
how
can
you
do
business
that
way?
who's
going
to
want
to
speak
to
your
president?
so
the
president
of
ukraine
reiterated
today
at
a
major
news
"conference,"
on
other
"subjects,"
that
he
was
under
absolutely
no
pressure.
he
doesn't
even
know
what
they're
talking
about.
and
he
used
the
"word,"
there
was
no
"\"blackmail\""
during
this
call.
he
used
that
term.
so
in
"theory,"
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
think
of
"it,"
a
president
of
the
united
states
who's
made
our
"economy,"
with
a
lot
of
help
from
all
of
"you,"
"frankly,"
but
from
mike
and
from
some
of
our
great
senators
and
some
of
our
great
people
that
we
have
with
"us,"
we
made
this
the
strongest
economy
in
our
history.
we've
rebuilt
our
military.
we're
taking
care
of
healthcare
like
nobody's
been
able
to
do.
what
we've
done
is
incredible.
and
by
the
"way,"
we're
protecting
your
second
amendment.
if
you
don't
have
"me,"
your
second
amendment
is
gone.
so
we
have
the
greatest
"economy,"
the
greatest
military.
we've
rebuilt
our
"military,"
$2.
5
"trillion,"
because
when
i
took
it
"over,"
it
was
a
mess.
and
what
do
they
want
to
do?
"\"let's"
impeach
our
"president,\""
right?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
we're
going
to
have
a
turnout
the
likes
of
which
we've
never
seen
in
the
history
of
our
country.
so
we
were
really
"forced,"
just
to
put
it
"away,"
we
were
forced.
i
"said,"
"\"just"
do
"it.\""
got
the
approval
from
ukraine.
i
have
to
ask.
i
"said,"
"\"hey,"
do
you
guys
"mind?\""
they
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
strange
"request.\""
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
it.
do
you
"mind?\""
and
they
"said,"
"\"please,"
go
ahead.
nothing
was
said
wrong
on
that
"call.\""
so
we
released
the
transcript
of
the
"call,"
which
was
so
good
that
that
crooked
adam
"schiff,"
this
guy
is
"crooked,"
he
had
to
make
up
a
fake
conversation
that
never
happened-
a
fake
conversation
that
never
"happened,"
and
he
delivered
it
to
the
united
states
congress
and
the
american
people.
it
was
a
total
fraud.
and
then
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
"\"oh,"
i
think
the
president
said
"that.\""
these
people
are
sick.
i'm
telling
"you,"
they're
sick.
and
you
know
what?
had
they
waited
one
day
"longer,"
they
would
have
had
the
transcript
of
the
actual
"call,"
word
for
word.
it
would've
been
perfect.
"instead,"
they
released
"it,"
they
went
"early,"
they
said
all
these
horrible
things.
you
know
why?
because
they
never
thought
in
a
million
years
that
i
was
going
to
release
a
transcript
of
the
call.
so
nancy
"pelosi,"
upon
hearing
a
false
story
from
a
whistleblower
that
had
no
clue
what
was
going
on
in
that
"call,"
or
somebody
gave
her
very
bad
"advice,"
but
also
hearing
it
from
shifty
shift
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
a
day
before
seeing
the
transcript
of
the
call
with
the
ukrainian
"president,"
"\"we've"
got
to
impeach
him.
we've
got
to
impeach
"him.\""
right?
and
then
she
saw
the
call
and
she
said
to
her
"people,"
"\"what"
the
hell?
nobody
ever
told
me
this
was
the
"call.\""
but
she
keeps
going
anyway
because
the
press
is
fake
and
they
play
right
into
their
hands.
the
do
nothing
democratic
extremists
have
gone
so
far
left
that
they
believe
it
should
not
be
a
crime
to
cross
our
border
"illegally,"
and
it
should
be
a
crime
to
have
a
totally
appropriate
"casual,"
"beautiful,"
accurate
phone
call
with
a
foreign
leader.
i
don't
think
so.
as
our
brilliant
white
house
counsel
wrote
to
the
democrats
"yesterday,"
he
"said,"
"\"their"
highly
partisan
and
unconstitutional
effort
threatens
grave
and
lasting
damage
to
our
democratic
"institutions,"
to
our
system
of
free
"elections,"
and
to
the
american
"people.\""
that's
what
it
is.
to
the
american
people.
it's
so
terrible.
democrats
are
on
a
crusade
to
destroy
our
democracy.
that's
what's
happening.
we
will
never
let
it
happen.
we
will
defeat
them.
i
"mean,"
look
at
their
debates.
these
people
are
crazy.
they
want
to
spend
$99
trillion
to
redo
buildings
all
over
the
united
states.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
china?
what
about
russia?
what
about
india?
what
about
all
these
other
countries
where
that
stuff
is
just
flowing
"out?\""
it's
all
right.
let
him
give
you
the
answer.
"man,"
did
the
cops
act
fast.
he's
already
gone.
that's
unbelievable.
that's
the
fastest
…
you
know
i
have
…
"look,"
i
love
law
enforcement.
i
love
the
cops.
i
love
the
"police,"
all
of
it.
"minneapolis,"
"minneapolis,"
you've
got
a
rotten
man.
you've
got
to
change
your
mayor.
you've
got
a
bad
mayor.
you've
got
a
bad
mayor.
but
you
know
what?
the
police
…
i've
done
this
a
lot
and
every
once
in
a
while
we'll
have
very
little
disturbance.
it's
really
…
"actually,"
is
there
any
place
where
we
can
have
more
fun
than
at
a
trump
rally?
and
we've
set
every
record
at
every
"place,"
"virtually,"
that
we've
gone.
and
one
of
the
big
musicians
"said,"
"\"and"
trump
does
it
without
a
"guitar.\""
can
you
believe
it?
without
a
guitar.
but
this
guy
…
so
i've
had
it
a
lot
where
…
but
sometimes
it'll
take
the
police
like
30
"seconds,"
50
seconds.
it's
like
roger
penske
when
you
watch
"him,"
who's
getting
the
presidential
medal
of
"freedom,"
by
the
"way,"
pretty
soon.
he
won
18
indy
"500s,"
"18,"
roger
penske.
but
it's
like
the
way
they
change
those
"tires,"
takes
four
seconds
to
change
the
whole
damn
thing.
i
"say,"
"\"how"
the
hell
do
they
do
"it?\""
that's
the
way
these
cops
just
reacted.
that
was
a
record.
i
think
it
was
a
…
i've
had
good
"service,"
but
i've
never
had
anything
like
that.
i
look
"up,"
the
guy
is
already
gone.
"ah,"
we
love
you
with
the
red
shirts.
so
now
the
democrats
are
making
a
pathetic
bid
to
save
sleepy
"joe,"
sleepy
joe
biden.
and
you
know
what?
i'd
love
to
run
against
"him,"
to
be
honest.
anybody
like
that.
if
you
can't
beat
him
in
a
"debate,"
you've
got
a
big
problem
folks.
you
can't
beat
him
in
a
"debate,"
you
can't
be
president.
because
what
are
you
going
to
do
against
president
xi
and
kim
jong
un.
you
can't
beat
sleepy
"joe,"
but
now
we're
going
to
meet
with
kim
jong
un?
i
don't
think
so.
but
he's
totally
owned
and
totally
controlled
by
the
washington
swamp
for
many
years.
two
months
after
president
obama
put
joe
in
charge
of
ukraine
"policy,"
they
put
joe
biden
in
charge
of
ukraine
policy.
listen
to
this.
and
the
press
will
not
write
it.
they
"say,"
"\"in"
totally
unsubstantiated
charges
"…\""
every
time
they
talk
about
him.
president
trump
has
said
that
his
son
walked
away
with
a
fortune.
now
you
know
that's
a
totally
unsubstantiated
charge.
really?
it's
not
an
"unsubstantiated,"
it's
fact.
joe's
son
hunter
got
thrown
out
of
the
navy
and
then
he
became
a
genius
on
wall
street
in
about
two
days.
by
the
"way,"
whatever
happened
to
hunter.
where
the
hell
is
he?
where's
hunter?
hey
"fellows,"
i
have
an
idea
for
a
new
t-shirt.
i
love
the
"cops,"
but
let's
do
another
t-shirt.
where's
hunter?
where
is
he?
here's
"hunter,"
being
examined
by
sleepy
eyes
chuck
todd
or
some
of
these
people.
"hunter,"
it's
so
great
that
you're
"here,"
sir.
"hunter,"
i
know
they're
giving
you
approximately
"$168,000"
a
month.
i
hear
they
paid
you
a
big
check
of
$3
million.
i
just
want
to
speak
on
behalf
of
nbc
who's
absolutely
one
of
the
worst.
i
just
want
to
tell
you
…
"hunter,"
hunter
i
just
want
to
tell
you
i
couldn't
be
happier
for
you
and
your
family
and
i
know
you
don't
know
anything
about
energy
and
i
know
it's
an
energy
"company,"
but
i
think
they
made
a
great
"deal,"
hunter.
and
then
they
fly
to
"china,"
and
i'm
dealing
with
people
right
now.
they're
tough
as
"hell,"
those
chinese
"negotiators,"
and
"hunter,"
who's
not
too
"smart,"
hunter.
he
goes
"in,"
he
has
a
"meeting,"
he
walks
out
in
his
fund
with
1.5
"billion,"
with
a
"b,"
one
point
five
billion
dollars.
these
aren't
the
same
chinese
negotiators
that
i'm
dealing
"with,"
i
can
tell
you.
these
are
not
the
same
"ones,"
but
we
are
doing
very
well
in
that
negotiation.
"now,"
think
of
"it,"
where's
hunter?
where
is
hunter?
i
want
to
see
hunter?
"hunter,"
you
know
nothing
about
"energy,"
you
know
nothing
about
"china,"
you
know
nothing
about
"anything,"
frankly.
"hunter,"
you're
a
loser.
why
did
you
get
one
point
five
billion
"dollars,"
hunter.
and
your
father
was
never
considered
smart.
he
was
never
considered
a
good
senator.
he
was
only
a
good
vice
president
because
he
understood
how
to
kiss
barack
obama's
ass.
true.
thank
you.
thank
you.
it's
true.
it's
true.
and
they're
always
saying
the
same
thing.
"yeah,"
he
got
a
billion
"five,"
we
admit
"it,"
they
admit
"it,"
it's
"nothing,"
but
"oh,"
it's
not
that
same
"thing,"
president
trump
made
a
totally
unsubstantiated
claim
about
hunter
biden
and
his
father.
it's
not
"unsubstantiated,"
you
crooked
son
of
a
"guns,"
it's
100%
true.
100%.
even
the
smart
guys
on
wall
"street,"
and
i
know
all
of
"them,"
they
are
smart.
they've
never
seen
anything
like
that
one
before.
i've
called
them.
does
that
ever
happen?
never
happens.
guy
walks
"in,"
no
"experience,"
no
nothing.
walks
out
with
a
billion
five.
gee.
flies
in
on
air
force
two
with
his
"father,"
the
vice
president.
don't
"forget,"
that's
when
he
was
vice
president.
so
china
gives
his
son
1.5
billion.
how
would
you
like
to
have
joe
biden
take
over
negotiations
right
now
with
china?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
"meanwhile,"
biden
allowed
china
to
rip
off
america
for
eight
years
as
vice
"president,"
and
barack
obama
let
him
just
rob
us
"blind,"
and
we're
not
doing
that
anymore.
those
days
are
over.
the
bidens
got
rich
and
that
is
substantiated.
while
america
got
"robbed,"
that's
what
happened.
sleepy
joe
and
his
friends
out
"america,"
they
didn't
have
tough
negotiations.
i
look
at
these
trade
deals
and
i
"say,"
"\"who"
the
hell
could
have
done
"this?\""
if
you
didn't
…
if
you
had
no
business
"instinct,"
no
business
"ability,"
if
you
had
"nothing,"
if
you're
dumb
as
"hell,"
you
wouldn't
make
these
"deals,"
they're
so
bad.
i
"say,"
"\"who"
made
these
deals?
who
made
these
"deals?\""
but
we're
ripping
them
all
up
and
redoing
them
and
they're
going
to
be
very
good.
wait
until
you
see
what
happens.
now
that
i'm
your
"president,"
you
see
it.
america
is
winning
again
and
we're
respected
again
as
a
nation.
a
brand
new
report
just
came
out
as
i'm
walking
on
the
stage.
hard
to
"believe,"
actually.
it
turns
out
that
joe
biden
was
vice
"president,"
he
worked
with
the
so
called
whistle
blower.
this
is
nothing
but
a
partisan
witch
"hunt,"
"sabotage,"
and
i'm
sure
they're
going
to
say
it's
totally
"unsubstantiated,"
but
one
of
them
wrote
this
story.
"congratulations,"
by
the
way.
that's
very
nice.
that's
really
good.
that's
the
way
you
should
do
it.
good.
good.
good.
in
the
twisted
worldview
of
democrats
and
the
"media,"
it's
okay
for
politicians
to
ship
our
jobs
to
foreign
"countries,"
flood
our
communities
with
drugs
and
"crime,"
and
enrich
themselves
at
america's
expense.
their
treachery
is
allowed
because
they
go
along
with
the
rigged
washington
"game,"
and
it
is
far
more
rigged.
when
i
"ran,"
i
thought
it
was
"rigged,"
but
this
is
crazy
what's
happening.
but
if
you
refuse
to
bow
or
bend
to
the
washington
"swamp,"
which
i
could
do
very
"easily,"
i'd
be
much
more
popular.
"folks,"
it
would
be
so
much
easier.
but
they
smear
"you,"
they
spy
on
"you,"
and
they
target
your
"friends,"
your
"family,"
your
staff
for
"harassment,"
for
"abuse,"
for
destruction.
i
came
down
to
washington
with
incredible
people.
we
won
a
great
political
campaign.
they
were
bright
eyed
and
bushy
tailed.
that's
a
nice
phrase.
they
came
"down,"
they
were
happy.
they
wanted
to
turn
the
country
around.
they
wanted
to
do
great
things.
all
of
a
sudden
they
get
summoned
and
they
get
subpoenaed
by
robert
mueller.
how
good
was
he
as
a
witness?
not
too
good
and
by
people
that
"were,"
i
call
them
the
13
angry
"democrats,"
that
turned
into
18
angry
democrats.
it
was
disgraceful.
so
people
that
were
going
"down,"
"\"sir,"
what
is
"this?\""
i
"look,"
"\"oh"
"wow,"
that's
a
"subpoena.\""
what
the
hell
is
this?
they
took
people
…
i
really
mean
this.
they
took
people
that
were
full
of
life
and
energy
and
vigor.
we
had
just
won
the
greatest
campaign
in
the
history
of
american
"politics,"
it's
true.
it's
true.
and
they
destroyed
their
lives.
they
destroyed
their
lives.
they
went
home.
i
could
name
many
"people,"
one
in
"particular,"
who
came
"down,"
an
incredible
young
woman.
she
was
going
to
help
people.
she
wanted
to
help
people.
she
had
causes
that
were
so
good.
she
wanted
to
help
"people,"
and
she
ended
up
going
"home,"
"dark,"
dark.
her
life
became
hell.
they
ruined
people.
they
destroyed
"people,"
good
people.
people
that
ended
up
paying
far
more
money
in
legal
fees
than
they
made.
than
they
made.
they
destroyed
great
people.
they're
"vicious,"
"horrible,"
and
the
media
was
behind
every
single
step.
they
destroyed
so
many
lives.
they
destroyed
so
many
"lives,"
and
they're
continuing
to
do
it.
and
it's
a
disgrace.
when
all
of
their
ludicrous
hoaxes
have
been
exposed
as
"frauds,"
these
sinister
fakers
then
tried
to
impeach
you
for
daring
to
call
out
their
own
corruption.
there's
nothing
like
the
dirty
political
"establishment,"
and
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
this
"is,"
friend
of
"mine,"
very
"smart,"
brilliant
"guy,"
was
with
me
about
two
weeks
ago.
we
just
got
rid
of
the
russia
hoax
and
then
a
week
later
the
ukraine
hoax
starts.
i
had
a
week
of
"like,"
"\"i"
can
think
about
everything
perfect.
it's
so
"beautiful.\""
and
he
"said,"
"\"president.\""
i
"said,"
"\"call"
me
donald.
you've
called
me
donald
for
35
"years.\""
"\"i"
will.
thank
you
"donald.\""
i've
lost
all
my
friends
because
they're
all
scared
to
talk.
"honestly,"
i'm
the
president
that
they
can't
talk
to
me
anymore.
it's
like
they're
afraid.
they
respect
the
office.
it's
true.
they
"say,"
"\"president.\""
i
"say,"
"\"do"
me
a
"favor,"
richard.
you've
called
me
donald
for
35
years.
call
me
"donald,"
please.
i
want
somebody
to
call
me
"donald.\""
true.
he
said
to
"me,"
i
just
told
him
call
me
…
he
"said,"
"\"president,"
i
can't
do
"it.\""
he
said.
so
he
"says,"
"\"president,"
you've
been
here
now
"for,"
think
of
"it,"
almost
three
years.
can
you
believe
we're
here
three
"years?\""
"we,"
"we,"
it's
we.
and
we
have
to
promise
them
no
more
than
16
years.
okay?
no
more.
no
more.
16
more
years.
i'm
only
kidding.
now
they'll
go
back.
"see,"
he
wants
to
run
for
more.
but
he
"said,"
"\"president,"
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
it's
so
important
to
"me.\""
he's
a
great
"businessman,"
very
successful.
he
"said,"
"\"you"
deal
with
all
of
these
"nations,"
these
"great,"
powerful
…
who
is
the
worst
to
deal
with?
is
it
china?
is
it
north
korea?
is
india?
is
it
russia?
please
tell
"me,"
mr.
"pres,"
who
is
the
toughest
nation
to
deal
"with?\""
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
not
going
to
believe
this.
it's
the
usa
is
the
toughest
nation
to
deal
"with.\""
the
usa.
it's
true.
because
we're
dealing
with
some
very
sick
and
deranged
people.
there
is
nothing
that
the
dirty
political
establishment
hates
more
than
a
president
that
they
cannot
"intimidate,"
own
and
control.
they're
trying
to
stop
me
because
they
know
that
i
don't
answer
to
"them,"
i
answer
to
you.
it's
true.
i
never
say
this.
i
don't
think
i've
ever
said
it
in
a
"speech,"
but
they'll
find
out
if
i
did.
they'll
give
me
"pinocchios,"
he
said
it
"before,"
but
i
don't
know
if
i
ever
said
this
before.
but
i
"make,"
as
"president,"
about
"$450,000."
i
give
it
away.
i
don't
care.
i
don't
want
it.
i
never
hear
anything.
can
you
imagine
if
i
didn't.
i
give
it
away
to
…
you
can
only
give
"it,"
you
can't
keep
it.
you
can't
actually
make
a
gift.
you
can
give
it
to
your
different
agencies.
so
i
can
give
it
to
"health,"
i
can
give
it
to
"transportation,"
i
can
give
it
to
"military,"
but
i
give
it
away
all
the
time.
"now,"
and
if
i
ever
did
…
but
it's
450.
if
somebody
stays
"from,"
let's
"say,"
a
middle
east
country
in
one
of
my
hotels
and
we
charge
him
392
dollars
and
53
cents
for
"staying,"
and
i
never
heard
of
the
guy
and
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
"him,"
they
"say,"
"\"trump"
is
getting
rich
off
our
"nation.\""
i
lose
billions
being
president.
i
don't
care.
it's
nice
to
be
"rich,"
i
guess.
but
i
lose
billions.
if
somebody
rents
a
room
someplace
and
they
pay
me
two
months
in
rent
or
hotel
"fees,"
i
never
heard
of
the
people.
i
never
know
who
they
are.
they
"say,"
"\"emoluments.\""
nobody
ever
heard
of
the
word
emoluments
before.
emoluments.
it's
the
craziest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
i
tell
"you,"
it's
cost
me
billions
of
dollars
to
be
president.
it
really
has.
and
at
some
point
i'll
probably
to
prove
"that,"
and
i
look
forward
to
doing
it..
it's
very
easy.
it's
very
easy.
and
there
is
nothing
that
makes
me
happier
than
making
that
decision
to
run
and
win
and
straighten
out
the
mess
that
these
people
have
created.
so
in
desperate
attempt
to
attack
our
movement.
nancy
and
"chuck,"
two
"beauties,"
have
given
control
of
the
democrat
party
entirely
over
to
the
radical
"left,"
including
minnesota's
own
representative
ilhan
omar.
i
know
you
people.
i
know
you
people.
i
know
the
people
of
"minnesota,"
and
i
want
to
tell
"you,"
and
i
"also,"
at
the
same
"time,"
it's
both
a
question
and
a
"statement,"
how'd
the
hell
did
that
ever
happen?
how
did
it
happen?
how
did
it
happen?
congresswoman
omar
is
an
america
hating
socialist.
she
minimized
the
september
11th
attack
on
our
homeland.
where
far
more
than
"3,000"
people
"died,"
"saying,"
"\"some"
people
did
something
big
deal.
some
people
did
"something.\""
she
pleaded
for
compassion
for
isis
recruits
right
here
in
minnesota.
omar
laughed
that
americans
speak
of
al-qaeda.
you
remember
that
tape?
speak
of
al-qaeda.
but
when
we
say
something
about
the
united
"states,"
you
just
don't
say
america
with
any
intensity.
remember
that?
representative
omar
has
a
history
of
launching
virulent
anti-semitic
"screeds,"
whether
you
like
it
or
not.
she's
said
the
us
support
for
israel
is
all
about
the
benjamins.
she
said
that
pro-israel
lawmakers
have
an
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country.
omar
wrote
that
israel
has
hypnotized
the
"world,"
may
allah
awaken
the
people
and
help
them
to
see
the
evil
doings
of
israel
and
the
united
states.
how
do
you
have
such
a
person
representing
you
in
minnesota?
i'm
very
angry
at
you
people
right
now.
she
is
a
disgrace
to
our
"country,"
and
she
is
one
of
the
big
reasons
that
i'm
going
to
"win,"
and
the
republican
party
is
going
to
win
minnesota
in
13
months.
thank
you
very
much.
so
we're
honored
to
have
with
us
today
a
special
"guest,"
a
man
that
really
is
a
terrific
talented
writer.
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
all
those
tangled
lies
of
omar.
mr.
scott
johnson
of
power
line.
he
wrote
some
"stuff,"
i
can't
believe
it.
where's
scott?
where's
scott?
thank
"you,"
scott.
thank
"you,"
scott.
what
a
job.
"man,"
do
you
have
her
figured
out.
the
only
problem
"is,"
"scott,"
it's
incredible
"talent,"
much
more
talented
than
most
of
these
people
that
you
heard
about.
the
problem
is
they
never
pick
it
up.
they
don't
want
to
pick
it
"up,"
but
we
pick
it
"up,"
"scott,"
and
the
people
get
it
and
we
thank
you
for
your
great
reporting.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
and
scott
reported
everything
about
omar
is
a
"fraud,"
including
her
name.
scott
reports
his
sources
told
him
"that,"
"quote,"
omar's
legal
husband
was
omar's
brother
and
that
she
had
married
him
for
fraudulent
purposes.
you
mean
like
coming
into
the
united
"states,"
maybe?
and
as
scott
"says,"
"\"we"
have
seen
a
plethora
of
congressional
scandals
in
our
history
yet
we
have
never
seen
scandals
like
omar's
in
"congress,"
and
nothing
gets
done
about
"it.\""
i
hope
that
some
of
you
people
are
"looking,"
because
what
aoc
has
gotten
away
with
campaign
financing
and
what
…
i
call
it
aoc
plus
"three,"
that's
what
it
is.
and
omar
is
one
of
the
three.
what
aoc
has
gotten
away
with
all
of
that
money
that
she
used
for
her
personal
self
with
campaign
finance
is
"worse,"
and
nothing
happens
to
"them,"
but
it
happens
to
"you,"
and
it's
not
fair.
the
fact
"is,"
we're
in
a
struggle
for
the
survival
of
democracy
in
america.
the
only
message
these
radical
socialists
and
extremists
will
understand-
message
these
radical
socialists
and
extremists
will
understand
is
a
crushing
defeat
on
november
"3rd,"
2020.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
win
back
the
"house,"
we
will
keep
the
senate
and
we
will
win
the
white
house.
and
we're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
some
incredible
people
that
have
helped
me
so
much.
one
of
your
tremendous
"talented,"
"tough,"
congressman
tom
emmer.
tom.
also
a
"man,"
you
don't
want
to
fight
"him,"
and
you
don't
want
to
play
him
in
hockey
because
he
was
tough.

pretty
"recently,"
and
i
was
out
here
campaigning
for

working
"hard,"

it
turned
out
to
be
an
easy
race
because
everyone
loves
him
and
respects
him.

i
guess
you'd
say
he's
brilliant.
his
education
is
"incredible,"
his
military
career
has
been
incredible.
then
he
ran
for

and
now
he's

we
going

she
"said,"
"\"honestly"
"sir,"
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this.
it's
going
to
be
easy.
don't
ever
say…
just
assume
we're
two
points
"behind,"
"okay?\""
two
points
behind.
you
never
ever…
please.
always
just
assume
you're
a
little
"behind,"
but
we're
going
to
win
this
state
by
so
much
that
people
are
going
to
be
shocked.
ad
plenty
of
other
states
too.
we
had
a
rally
three
weeks
ago
in
new
"mexico,"
and
new
mexico's
a
hard
state
for
"republicans,"
hasn't
been
won
in
a
long
time
also.
and
we
had
receptivity
that
was
unbelievable.
the
audience
was
40%
"hispanic,"
where
we're
doing
great.
and
you
"know,"
"hispanic,"
they
understand
borders
better
than
"anybody,"
better
than
we
do.
they
understand
"safety,"
they
understand
their
"job,"
they
don't
want
people
taking
it
"away,"
they
don't
want
crime.
they
understand
it
better.
that's
why
we're
doing
so
"well,"
but
we're
in
new
"mexico,"
and
i'm
telling
"you,"
that
was
electric.
but
"honestly,"
all
evenings
are
electric.
we
haven't
had
any
bad
ones.
we
haven't.
they're
all
electric.
a
woman
who
headed
up
the
great
state
of
michigan
for
"me,"
a
state
that
hadn't
been
won
in
a
long
time
by
a
republican
for
whatever
"reason,"
but
it
hadn't
been
won.
i
guess
we
didn't
have
the
right
"candidates,"
right?
but
a
woman
who
would
call
me
constantly.
i'd
"say,"
"\"i"
don't
want
to
talk
to
her.
she's
giving
me
a
"headache.\""
"\"sir,"
if
you
make
one
more
"trip,"
you're
going
to
win
"michigan.\""
i
"say,"
"\"all"
"right,\""
i
make
the
"trip,"
i
go
back
home.
i
get
a
call
the
next
"morning,"
"\"sir,"
we
need
one
"more.\""
this
went
over
and
over
and
"over,"
and
we
ended
up
winning
the
state
of
"michigan,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"who"
the
hell
was
that
woman
that
kept
bugging
me
to
go
back
to
michigan
and
speak
just
one
more
time
every
week?
one
more
"time,"
"sir.\""
and
her
name
is
ronna
mcdaniel.
she's
"fantastic,"
and
she's
the
head
of
the
rnc.
she's
great.
and
our
campaign
"manager,"
a
man
who's
really
been…
they
used
to
say
that
crooked
hillary
had
a
very
very
sophisticated
campaign.
after
she
"lost,"
they
"said,"
"\"i"
guess
it
wasn't
"sophisticated.\""
we
had
a
sophisticated
campaign.
nobody
knows
the
world
of
computers
better
than
this
guy.
brad
parscale.
remember
when
they
used
to
say
it?
you
"know,"
i
never
got
credit.
my
father
used
to
teach
"me,"
if
you
can
do
it
for
less
and
"win,"
that's
good.
he
wasn't
talking
politics.
the
last
thing…
he's
looking
down.
he's
definitely
looking
"down,"
not
looking
up.
he
was
great.
he
was
"tough,"
but
he
was
great.
but
my
father
would
"say,"
"\"if"
you
could
do
it
for
less
and
"win,"
that's
a
good
"thing,"
not
a
bad
thing.
if
you
can
build
a
building
for
less
money
than
the
guy
across
the
"street,"
and
if
it's
a
nicer
building
and
you
can
rent
for
"less,"
you're
really…
that's
like
a
good
"thing.\""
so
in
the
"campaign,"
we
spent
much
less
money
than
crooked
hillary
"clinton,"
much.
and
we
won.
and
we
won.
we
won
306
to
223.
that's
a
pretty
big…
remember?
remember
they
said
electoral
college.
by
the
"way,"
when
you
"run,"
if
you're
"running,"
the
electoral
college
is
like
the
100
yard
"dash,"
and
the
total
"vote,"
you
don't
go
certain
places.
you
focus.
electoral
college.
we
have
to
explain
to
"them,"
it's
different.
so
we
won
"306,"
and
do
you
remember
they
sued
to
say
one's
the
100
yard
dash.
you
practice.
one's
the
mile.
you
practice.
it's
a
different
race.
winning
the
total
vote
is
much
easier
in
my
opinion.
the
electoral
"college,"
i
had
to
go
to
22
different
states.
for
the
total
"vote,"
i'd
go
to
four
states
"maximum,"
right?
much
easier.
it's
much
easier.
i'm
all
for
"it,"
but
the
electoral
college
is
better
for
our
country
because
it
forces
you
to
go
places
that
you
wouldn't
go.
i
love
maine.
i
went
to
maine
four
or
five
times.
i
needed
one
point.
maine
gave
me
one
point.
and
what
happened?
what
happened?
i
went
there
numerous
times.
everyone
"said,"
"\"why?\""
because
i
was
told
by
these
fraudsters
back
here
in
the
media
that
trump
cannot
get
to
270.
he
cannot
get…
they
had
me
"maximum,"
if
everything
"worked,"
right?
at
269.
so
i
kept
going
to
"maine,"
and
you
know
what?
we
won
that
one
point
in
maine.
we
won
it.
it's
true.
but
i
kept
going.
they
"say,"
"\"why?\""
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
first
of
"all,"
it
is
really
a
beautiful
"place,\""
but
we
won
the
point.
but
they
"said,"
"\"he"
can
not
get
to
"270,\""
and
i
heard
this
for
months
and
months.
i
had
such
a
"headache,"
almost
as
bad
as
listening
to
mike's
damn
commercials
about
those
pillows.
maybe
i
need
one
of
those
pillows
to
cure
my
headache.
does
it
cure
headaches?
i
think
so.
but
here's
the
thing.
here's
the
thing.
so
they
"said,"
"\"he"
cannot
get
to
"270.\""
in
other
"words,"
you
can't
win.
you
don't
get
to
"270,"
it's
over.
you
can't
"win,"
right?
he
cannot
do
it.
there's
no
way
of
doing
"it,"
and
they
were
right.
i
got
to
306.
they
were
right.
but
i
didn't
get
to
306.
you
got
to
306.
we
won
incredible
states.
we
won
incredible
states.
we
won
"wisconsin,"
we
won
"michigan,"
we
won
"pennsylvania,"
we
won
north
"carolina,"
we
won
south
"carolina,"
we
won
florida.
what
a
run.
do
you
remember
the
evening
that
we
won?
i
think…
"look,"
forgetting
"me,"
i
think
it
was
won
of
all
of
us
together
because
we
all
worked
hard.
i
was
the
"messenger,"
but
we
all
worked
hard.
that
was
our
"victory,"
not
my
victory.
but
that
was
one
of
the
greatest
nights
in
the
history
of
"television,"
one
of
the
greatest
"nights,"
and
hopefully
it'll
go
down
when
we're
allowed
to
get
all
of
this
stuff
seeded…
you
"know,"
it's
like
a
tree.
you
plant
it.
you
plant
it.
it
has
to
"go,"
but
it
needs
a
little…
that's
why
we
need
the
four
more
additionally
years.
it's
got
to
grab
on
and
"catch,"
so
they
can't
destroy
it.
so
they
can't
destroy
it.
but
i
think
it'll
go
"down,"
and
i
hope
it's
going
to
go
down
as
one
of
the
greatest
evenings
in
the
history
of
this
"country,"
because
it's
never
"happened,"
anything
like
that
before.
and
these
guys
don't
even
question
it.
they
just
sit
back
and
"say,"
"\"i"
guess
he's
right
about
"that.\""
i'll
never
forget
the
night
"before,"
i
was
at
a
tremendous
arena.
the
place
was
going
crazy.
it
was
like
"this,"
going
"crazy,"
and
two
reporters
that
hate
my
"guts,"
they
looked
at
"themselves,"
they
looked
at
each
other.
famous
shot.
they're
looking
like
this
and
they're
"saying,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
going
"on?\""
they
knew.
they
knew.
and
i
didn't
need
beyonce
and
jay
"z,"
and
i
didn't
need
little
bruce
springsteen
and
all
of
these
people.
they'd
get
all
these
people.
they'd
come
in
because
she
couldn't
get
a
crowd.
they'd
come
"in,"
they'd
sing.
they
got
bruce
springsteen.
okay?
he'd
do
about
two
songs
and
leave.
what
happens
"is,"
they
"leave,"
and
then
everyone
leaves
with
"them,"
and
she's
still
speaking
in
front
of
the
same
lousy
crowd.
it's
the
craziest
thing
i've
ever
seen.
and
then
they
complain.
sometimes
i'll
use
terrible
word
like
hell.
the
other
day
i
used
the
word
hell.
i
got
hell
from…
they
"said,"
"\"he"
used
terrible
"language.\""
i
used
the
word
hell.
it
was
so
bad.
but
you've
got
to
hear
jay
"z,"
the
words
he
was
"using,"
he
was
using
the
f
word
all
over
the
"place,"
and
then
the
next
day
they
say
i
use
bad
language.
the
word
hell
is
a
terrible
word.
these
people
are
sick.
but
that
was
an
amazing
evening.
i'll
never
forget
that
evening.
look.
outside
of
your
family
and
your
children
and
things…
i
love
you
"too,"
darling.
it
was
one
of
the
highest
rated
evenings
in
the
history
of
television.
you
add
up
all
those
networks.
remember
the
woman
crying?
oh
my
god.
"no,"
they
weren't
biased
at
all.
"now,"
another
very
special
man
who's
with
us
"today,"
but
he'll
never
be
a
man
to
"me,"
he'll
always
be
my
"boy,"
you
know
what
i
mean?
right?
he's
my
boy.
he's
my
little
six
foot
six
"boy,"
eric
trump.
and
the
parents
understand
"that,"
right?
they
may
be
big
and
strong
and
older.
to
a
"parent,"
a
child
is
always
their
boy
or
always
their
little
beautiful
"girl,"
and
i
know
that's
probably
politically
incorrect.
they'll
"say,"
"\"it"
was
terrible
what
he
said
about
women.
"terrible.\""
but
they're
our
boy
and
they're
our
"girl,"
and
it
doesn't
matter
how
old
we
get
and
how
old
they
"get,"
is
that
a
correct
statement?
and
i'm
also
proud
to
endorse
your
next
republican
senator
from
"minnesota,"
a
man
that
i've
"known,"
a
man
that
is
tough
and
"smart,"
a
man
that's
running
against
somebody
that's
never
done
a
damn
thing
in
the
"senate,"
mr.
jason
lewis.
and
jason
did
a
great
job
in
congress.
congressman
"lewis,"
thank
you
very
"much,"
and
thank
you
for
putting
up
with
all
of
this
stuff
because
i'll
tell
"you,"
it's
going
to
be
nasty.
it's
going
to
be
nasty.
they're
going
to
make
up
stories
about
you.
they're
going
to
say
things
that's
going
to
want
to
make
your
wife
"say,"
"\"why"
did
i
marry
this
"guy?\""
just
"say,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
it.
it's
just
another
phony
"story.\""
thank
you
very
much
mr.
and
mrs.
lewis.
"jason,"
thank
you.
and
"jason,"
they
can
say
that
about
tom
cotton.
he's
too
"perfect,"
this
guy.
he
can't
say…
they
can't
say
it
about

"anyway,"
good
luck

well.
and
i
don't
know
"why,"
but
with
all
of
the
great
people
i
just
"introduced,"
for
"tonight,"
maybe
this
is
the
most
important
"person,"
because
i
turned
on
a
very
good
show
in
the
morning.
fox
and
friends.
they
treat
us
great.
i
just
want
fairness.
what
a
great
group.
ainsley
and
"steve,"
and
by
the
"way,"
brian
has
gotten
a
lot
"better,"
right?
and
how
good
does
jessie
waters
do?
how
good?
right?
just
some
really
great
people.
and
"again,"
tucker's
been
very
good
i
have
to
say.
he's
been
good.
smart.
he's
been
great.
"tucker,"
and
the
legendary
sean
hannity.
great.
number
one.
number
one
show.
sean's
got
the
number
one
show.
and
laura
ingraham
is
knocking
them
out
of
the
"park,"
laura.
and
you
go
"over,"
maria
"bartiromo,"
and
the
great
lou
dobbs.
how
good
are
they?
lou
dobbs.
and
many
more.
and
many
more.
how
about
greg?
greg
used
to
hate
me.
"now,"
he's
good.
"oh,"
we
can't
forget…
we
can't
forget
judge
jeanine.
i
would
be
in
such
trouble
if
i
forgot
judge
jeanine.
"no,"
these
are…
and
there
are
many
more.
i
just…
"look,"
i'm
just
rattling
some
names
"off,"
but
they're
just
terrific
people.
they're
terrific
people.
but
a
man
that
i
have
to
really
say
something
very
special
about…
00
"slot,"
because
i'm
out
of
there
pretty
"good,"
and
i
see
a
handsome
young
man
named
bob
"kroll,"
cops
for
trump.
and
he's
talking
about
this
lousy
mayor
they've
got.
"now,"
he
didn't
quite
say
"that,"
but
i
say
it.
he's
talking
about
this
lousy
mayor
that
won't
let
the
"cops,"
the
"police,"
the
law
enforcement…
my
father
always
used
to
"say,"
"\"son…\""
and
he
meant
it
to.
"\"never"
say
cops.
it's
disrespectful.
say
police
"officer.\""
i
"said,"
"\"okay"
"pop.\""
but
"honestly,"
the
truth
is
with
"time,"
i
love
you
guys
whether
you're
"cops,"
police
"officers,"
law
enforcement.
i'll
call
you
whatever
you
want.
it
doesn't
matter.
you
are
so
"great,"
so
respected.
you
don't
even
know
how
much
our
public
loves
you.
you
don't
know
it.
you
don't
know
it.
you
don't
know
it.
but
i
see
this
"guy,"
and
i
don't
know
if
he's
done
a
lot
of
television
"before,"
but
he
was
very
effective
and
very
good.
and
he
was
saying
how
the
police
aren't
being
allowed
to
take
care
of
this
"rally,"
and
yet
with
president
obama
and
bush
and
all
these
"people,"
they
were
"fine,"
fine.
everybody
comes.
they
fall
asleep
at
a
rally.
but
they
weren't
allowed
to
do
the
job
for
"us,"
and
they
went
wild.
so
what
i
want
to
do…
go
home
to
mommy.
mommy
"says,"
"\"i"
saw
you
on
television
tonight.
i
love
trump.
don't
you
ever
do
that
"again.\""
"\"yes"
mom.
yes
"mom.\""
but
the
job
he
did
before
the
"election,"
i
came
right
here
to
"minnesota,"
and
i
pledged
to
address
this
really
important
"issue,"
and
it's
the
issue
of
law
enforcement.
and
when
i
saw
this
"man,"
this
great
gentleman
on
television
pouring
out
his
"guts,"
pouring
out
his
heart…
i
don't
know
him.
he
knows
i've
been
good
to
law
enforcement.
he
knows
i've
been
good
"to,"
as
my
father
would
"say,"
"\"the"
"police.\""
he
knows
i
love
the
cops.
he
knows
"that,"
and
so
does
everyone
else.
i
"mean,"
it's
so
many
"shirts,"
so
many
red
"shirts,"
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
here
without
the
red
"shirts,"
and
i
want
to
just
tell
"you,"
the
respect
that
we
have
for
law
enforcement
is
unbound.
it's
unbound.
come
up
here.
"bob,"
come
up.
say
something.
thank
you
fellas.
i'll
see
you
later.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
great
people.
thank
you.
what
a
group.
i
think
your
very
weak
mayor
made
a
mistake
when
he
took
them
on.
as
you
"know,"
for
many
"years,"
leaders
in
washington
brought
large
numbers
of
refugees
to
your
state
from
somalia
without
considering
the
impact
on
schools
and
communities
and
taxpayers.
i
promised
you
that
as
"president,"
i
would
give
local
communities
a
greater
say
in
refugee
"policy,"
and
put
in
place
enhanced
vetting
and
responsible
immigration
controls.
and
i've
done
that.
since
coming
into
"office,"
i
have
reduced
refugee
resettlement
by
"85%,"
and
as
you
"know,"
maybe
especially
in
"minnesota,"
i
kept
another
promise.
i
issued
an
executive
"action,"
making
clear
that
no
refugees
will
be
resettled
in
any
city
or
any
state
without
the
express
written
consent
of
that
city
or
that
state.
so
speak
to
your
mayor.
you
should
be
able
to
decide
what
is
best
for
your
own
cities
and
for
your
own
"neighborhoods,"
and
that's
what
you
have
the
right
to
do
right
now.
and
believe
"me,"
no
other
president
would
be
doing
that.
if
democrats
were
ever
to
seize
"power,"
they
would
open
the
floodgates
to
"unvetted,"
uncontrolled
migration
at
levels
you
have
never
seen
before.
do
you
think
you
have
it
bad
now?
you
would
never
have
seen
anything
like
what
they
want
to
do.
but
in
the
trump
"administration,"
we
will
always
protect
american
families
"first,"
and
that
has
not
been
done
in
minnesota.
we've
also
implemented
the
strongest
screening
and
vetting
mechanisms
ever
put
into
place.
we
are
keeping
"terrorists,"
criminals
and
extremists
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
and
i
want
to
thank
the
country
of
mexico.
the
president
of
mexico
has
been
incredible.
we
have
"now,"
"27,000"
mexican
soldiers.
they're
"great,"
and
they're
"tough,"
and
they
are
now
protecting
our
"border,"
and
those
numbers
have
gone
down
like
this.
thank
you
mr.
president.
we
will
not
make
the
mistakes
made
in
european
"countries,"
that
allow
a
violent
ideology
to
take
root
in
our
"country,"
on
our
shores.
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
happen.
and
as
you
all
"know,"
to
protect
our
citizens
from
those
who
would
do
harm
to
"us,"
i
instituted
a
very
"controversial,"
very
hard
to
"get,"
travel
ban
on
some
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
countries.
and
the
other
"day,"
one
of
the
fake
news
reporters
in
the
back
said…
they
were
talking
about
the
travel
"ban,"
and
they
"said,"
"\"well"
you
"know,"
the
president
has
lost
in
"court.\""
they
"said,"
"\"where?\""
"\"on"
the
travel
"ban.\""
and
he's
right.
i
"lost,"
and
then
i
lost
at
the
appellate
"division,"
and
then
i
won
at
the
united
states
supreme
court.
right?
and
he
knew
"that,"
but
he
said
i
lost
on
the…
and
he
was
right.
i
"lost,"
and
then
i
lost
"again,"
but
then
i
"won,"
and
we
have
the
travel
ban.
but
instead
of
"saying,"
"\"he"
"lost,"
and
then
he
lost
at
the
"appellate,"
and
then
he
won
at
the
united
states
supreme
"court,\""
he
"said,"
"\"he"
lost
on
the
travel
"ban.\""
these
are
very
dishonest
people.
do
you
understand
that?
very
dishonest
people.
in
the
republican
"party,"
we
believe
that
those
who
seek
to
join
our
society
must
embrace
our
"values,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
love
our
people.
democrats
also
support
deadly
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
release
dangerous
criminal
aliens
into
the
heart
of
your
"communities,"
and
we're
not
letting
it
happen
anymore.
republicans
believe
american
cities
should
be
sanctuaries
for
"americans,"
not
for
criminal
aliens.
my
administration
is
taking
historic
action
to
secure
the
border.
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
by
over
60%
since
"may,"
and
we
are
building
the
wall
faster
than
anyone
ever
anticipated
it
could
be
built.
and
this
is
a
serious
wall.
you've
all
seen
it.
it's
going
up
"rapidly,"
and
you
think
that
was
easy?
i
had
every
democrat
in
congress
fighting
"me,"
fighting
"me,"
fighting
me.
i
had
a
lot
of
the
rhinos
fighting
me.
they
"say,"
"\"see,"
he's
not
getting
it
built.
he's
not
"getting…\""
let
me
tell
you.
you
have
every
democrat
fighting
you.
we
took
it
from
"here,"
and
we
took
it
from
"there,"
and
we
took
it
from
all
over
the
"place,"
and
we
got
that
thing.
that's
the
biggest
patchwork
of
financing
you've
ever
"seen,"
and
that
sucker
is
going
"up,"
and
it
is
the
"finest,"
it
is
the
"strongest,"
it's
largely
30
feet
"tall,"
which
is
the
maximum
height
that
they
wanted.
i
went
to
the
border
"patrol,"
and
i
sat
down
with
15
representatives
of
the
border
"patrol,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
want?
what's
your
"ideal?\""
i
actually
"said,"
"\"i"
want
to
give
you
the
rolls
"royce,\""
and
they
killed
me
for
that.
they
"said,"
"\"it's"
not
an
american
made
"product.\""
"yeah,"
they
happened
to
be
right.
"no,"
they're
right
about
that
one.
they're
actually
right
"there,"
tom.
but
i
"said,"
"\"i"
want
to
give
you
the
rolls
royce
of
walls.
tell
"me.\""
and
they
told
me
"everything,"
and
then
we
built
some
alternative
walls.
we
built
all
different
types.
we
built
about
seven
of
"them,"
and
then
we
had
climbers
come
in.
the
one
that
worked
the
best
was
the
one
we're
building.
it
"also,"
unfortunately…
the
bad
"news,"
it's
also
the
most
expensive.
but
we
got
it
for
the
right
price.
we
got
it
for
the
right
price.
it's
"steel,"
it's
hardened
"concrete,"
it's
"deep,"
it's
"high,"
it's
a
thing
of
beauty.
and
it's
going
to
keep
bad
people
out
of
our
country.
that's
what
it's
going
to
do.
and
the
democrats
knew
this.
most
of
the
democrats
four
years
"ago,"
they
wanted
a
wall.
now
all
of
a
"sudden,"
they
don't
want
a
wall.
you
know
why
they
don't
want
a
wall?
because
i
want
it.
that's
the
only
reason.
and
i
just
thought
of
it
a
year
ago.
i
"said,"
"\"man,"
this
could've
been
so
much
"easier.\""
all
i
had
to
do
is
"say,"
"\"we"
don't
want
a
"wall,\""
and
they
would've
given
me
all
the
financing
i
wanted
for
the
wall.
what
was
i
thinking?
we're
not
going
to
build
a
"wall,"
and
they
would
have
forced
me
to
build
it.
i
would've…
it's
true.
under
this
"administration,"
we
are
also
ending
the-
…
this
administration.
we
are
also
ending
the
endless
wars.
we
have
to
do
"it,"
folks.
we
have
to
do
it.
we
have
totally
defeated
the
isis
"caliphate,"
and
i
did
that
in
rather
quick
time
if
you
"remember,"
because
we
have
the
greatest
fighting
"machine,"
now.
when
i
came
in
and
was
totally
depleted.
we
have
great
"generals,"
we
have
great
"warfighters,"
and
they
did
it
so
fast.
i
flew
to
"iraq,"
i
met
with
the
"generals,"
right?
i
met
with
the
generals.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
hear
it's
going
to
take
a
year
to
two
"years.\""
"\"sir,"
we
can
do
it
in
two
"weeks.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what?\""
"\"they"
don't
let
us
"fight,"
sir.
they
don't
let
us
fight.
we
want
to
fight.
they
don't
let
us
"fight.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
let
you
"fight.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
come
if
they
say
it's
going
to
take
anywhere
from
a
year
to
two
"years,"
you
say
you
can
do
it
so
"quickly?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
the
front.
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
the
back.
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
the
"sides,"
from
"underground,"
from
overground.
we
going
to
hit
the
hell
out
of
"them.\""
and
they
did.
and
we
won
very
quickly.
but
from
now
"on,"
we
want
to
fight
where
it
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
of
"america,"
not
to
the
benefit
of
other
countries.
and
we
will
only
fight
to
win.
we're
only
going
to
fight
to
win.
we
don't
fight
to
win.
we
don't
fight
to
win.
the
turks
have
been
fighting
with
the
kurds
for
two
"centuries,"
and
"turkey,"
as
you
"know,"
is
a
nato
ally.
but
i've
been
rough
on
them.
we've
defeated
100%
of
that
isis
"caliphate,"
and
no
longer
have
any
troops
in
the
area.
we
don't
have
any
troops.
the
troops
have
been
pulled
out.
where
turkey
is
carrying
out
now
a
very
tough
campaign
against
the
"kurds,"
get
them
out.
so
turkey
is
right
now
waging
a
very
tough
campaign
against
the
kurds.
we
got
along
with
the
"kurds,"
and
we
helped
the
kurds.
and
don't
forget
they're
also
fighting
for
their
land.
you
know
that.
but
they're
fighting.
so
we
have
three
choices.
you're
ready?
here
are
the
three
choices.
we
don't
have
any
soldiers
there
because
we've
left.
we
won.
we
left.
take
a
"victory,"
united
states.
we
left.
take
a
"victory,"
take
a
victory.
bring
our
troops
back
home.
i
told
this
story
"yesterday,"
i
have
to
sign
"letters,"
it's
the
hardest
thing
i
have
to
do.
i
sign
"letters,"
"\"dear"
mr.
and
mrs.
smith
from
arkansas.
dear
mr.
and
mrs.
jones
from
alabama.
dear
mr.
and
mrs.
somebody
from
some
great
"state,"
i'm
sorry
to
inform
"you,"
your
son
has
been
killed
in
combat.
i'm
so
"sorry.\""
and
every
letter
is
individually
done
because
sometimes
the
"parents,"
they're
"grieving,"
and
they
get
together
with
other
"parents,"
and
i
don't
want
to
see
that
it's
like
the
same
letter.
so
we
do
different
letters.
it's
the
hardest
thing
i
have
to
do.
hardest
thing.it's
the
hardest
thing
i
have
…
i
was
telling
tom
"cotton,"
it's
the
hardest
thing
that
i
have
to
do.
and
i
sign
those
"letters,"
and
it
"just,"
it
breaks
your
heart.
and
by
the
"way,"
there's
a
time
to
fight.
nobody
fights
harder
than
i
do.
but
there's
a
"time,"
and
there's
not
necessarily
a
time.
but
i
send
these
letters
"out,"
quite
a
few.
and
sometimes
i
send
letters
"out,"
it's
called
blue
on
"green,"
where
we're
teaching
people
how
to
fight
and
then
they
turn
the
gun
on
our
soldiers
and
shoot
them
in
the
back.
and
that's
the
hardest
thing
for
a
parent.
i
have
all
of
them.
i
know
everyone.
that's
the
hardest
thing
for
a
parent
when
they
get
"notification,"
because
they
learn
how
their
child
has
died.
when
the
so-called
people
that
were
teaching
how
to
fight
turn
the
gun
on
"them,"
and
shoot.
we've
had
a
lot
of
"that,"
a
lot
of
it
in
"afghanistan,"
more
than
we've
ever
had
proportionately
before.
it's
a
"horrible,"
horrible
thing.
but
i
have
to
sign
these
letters.
and
sometimes
i
go
out
to
a
"place,"
dover
air
force
"base,"
it's
a
very
tough
experience.
mike
pence
"goes,"
i
"go,"
other
people
"go,"
tom
cotton
goes.
we
go
out
"there,"
and
we
meet
the
parents
and
the
"families,"
the
"wives,"
the
"children,"
the
"sisters,"
the
brothers.
we
meet
"them,"
and
we
talked
to
"them,"
and
their
son
or
daughter
is
being
flown
in
from
some
far
away
place
in
a
"coffin,"
and
these
things
are
just
impossible.
i
don't
know
how
parents
can
do
"it,"
even.
and
i'll
meet
them.
and
we
have
a
particular
"colonel,"
that's
all
he
does.
so
good.
so
professional.
that's
what
he
does.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
greet
the
"dead,"
sir.
i
greet
the
"dead.\""
and
what
happens
is
this
big
incredible
machine
flies
"in,"
this
tremendous
cargo
"plane,"
and
it
flies
in
so
"powerful,"
so
big.
i'll
be
talking
to
some
of
the
"parents,"
and
they'll
act
like
they're
fine.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
are
you
"doing?\""
"\"we're"
"fine,"
sir.
we're
fine.
we're
really
"good.\""
i
"say,"
"\"that's"
"great.\""
and
i'll
tell
the
"colonel,"
i'll
"say,"
"\"colonel,"
i
think
they're
doing
"great.\""
"\"no"
"sir,"
they're
not
going
to
do
great.
you'll
"see.\""
and
i
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
"about,"
this
is
the
first
time.
then
we
went
outside
to
the
"runway,"
and
this
incredible
machine
is
flying
"in,"
and
it
"lands,"
and
it
comes
"over,"
and
it
pulls
"up,"
and
we
have
military
"guards,"
we
have
incredible
talented
musicians
that
do
this.
that's
what
they
do.
what
happens
is
that
door
opens
"up,"
and
the
colonel
told
"me,"
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
when
that
door
opens
"up,"
those
same
people
that
you
think
are
"okay,"
do
things
that
you'll
never
see.
you
will
hear
sounds
like
you've
never
"heard.\""
that's
what
he
does.
i
saw
that
door
open
up
with
a
coffin
with
a
flag
over
it.
the
door
was
"opened,"
and
these
beautiful
"soldiers,"
five
or
six
on
each
"side,"
lifting
the
coffin
and
walking
down
the
"runway,"
the
"plank,"
they
call
"it,"
off
this
cargo
plane.
and
i
see
parents
make
"sounds,"
that
were
just
20
minutes
ago
absolutely
"fine,"
make
"sounds,"
scream
and
cry
like
you've
never
seen
before.
the
colonel
was
telling
me
"that,"
"\"sir,"
you'll
see
things
that
you've
never
seen
before.
a
mother
who
was
fine
20
minutes
"ago,"
you
"think,"
breaking
the
military
line
and
jumping
"off,"
and
then
jumping
onto
a
coffin
of
her
son
or
her
"daughter,"
jumping
"on,"
on
top
of
the
"flowers,"
on
top
of
the
american
"flag.\""
i've
seen
this.
then
i
have
all
these
people
that
want
to
stay.
they
want
to
stay.
and
i
don't
want
to
stay.
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
syria
for
30
days.
we've
now
been
there
for
10
years.
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
afghanistan
for
a
short
period
of
time.
we're
now
going
to
be
there
for
close
to
19
years.
it's
time
to
bring
them
home.
it's
time
to
bring
them
home.
it's
true.
time
to
bring
them
home.
we've
done
our
"job,"
we've
defeated
everyone
that
we're
supposed
to
defeat.
and
now
we
"are,"
we
are
"policing,"
we
are
now
policing.
that's
what
we're
doing.
we're
policing.
and
"that,"
as
i
"said,"
no
more
respect
for
the
"police,"
but
these
are
military
"people,"
and
those
are
"police,"
but
we
are
now
policing.
we're
not
"fighting,"
we're
policing.
and
you
know
what?
after
all
of
these
years
…
one
other
"story,"
and
i
have
to
tell
you.
i
go
to
walter
reed
on
"friday,"
and
i
do
it
quite
often.
i
gave
out
five
purple
hearts.
and
i
meet
people
that
are
so
"beautiful,"
so
amazing.
i
met
five
"warriors,"
and
one
was
so
badly
"hurt,"
with
the
loss
of
arms
and
a
"leg,"
another
one
…
they're
just
"very,"
very
devastated.
but
these
are
"great,"
great
people.
and
i
gave
out
the
purple
heart.
and
i
see
the
"parents,"
and
i
have
to
"say,"
walter
"reed,"
i
want
to
just
"say,"
the
doctors
"there,"
the
job
they
"do,"
you
"know,"
you
hear
so
many
complaints
about
doctors
and
about
the
"vets,"
and
the
vets'
"care,"
and
nobody's
done
better.
we
got
choice
for
the
vets.
we
did
things
for
the
vets
that
nobody
thought
would
be
possible.
but
i
saw
these
young
"men,"
and
i
gave
them
their
purple
hearts.
and
their
parents
were
there
crying.
and
one
of
them
was
so
amazing.
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
your
"problem?\""
"\"sir,"
my
face
was
blown
apart.
my
nose
was
absolutely
just
blown
"apart.\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
it's
"incredible.\""
and
i
looked
at
"him,"
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
the
most
beautiful
nose
i've
ever
seen.
what
do
you
"mean?\""
he
"said,"
"\"a"
doctor
worked
on
my
face
for
10
hours
in
the
field.
he
said
there
were
a
thousand
"fragments.\""
now
i
don't
know
if
that's
"right,"
but
"well,"
a
lot.
he
meant
a
lot.
"\"he"
said
there
were
a
thousand
fragments.
he
rebuilt
my
nose
with
glue.
he
glued
the
bones
together.
he
rebuilt
my
"nose.\""
i
"say,"
"\"you"
have
the
most
beautiful
nose
i've
ever
"seen,\""
and
it's
true.
and
his
father
came
over
to
"me,"
he
"said,"
"\"sir,\""
father
was
"crying,"
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
"honestly,"
my
son
looks
better
"now.\""
he
"said,"
"\"my"
son
did
not
have
a
good
look.
he
knows.
now
look
at
"it,"
it's
"beautiful,"
it's
"beautiful.\""
but
these
doctors
at
walter
"reed,"
and
these
"army,"
and
"marine,"
and
the
medical
"doctors,"
they
are
unbelievably
great
people.
and
they
see
sights
that
you
and
i
hopefully
will
never
see.
they
see
things
that
nobody
will
ever
"see,"
and
there's
nobody
like
them.
and
i
have
to
give
a
shout
out
to
those
"people,"
there's
nobody
like
them.
so
in
the
case
of
"turkey,"
and
"syria,"
and
the
"kurds,"
we
could
send
in
a
thousand
troops
for
a
military
conflict
with
turkey.
"no,"
you
don't
want
to
do
that.
we
could
hit
turkey
very
hard
financially.
or
we
could
mediate
a
deal
between
turkey
and
the
kurds.
i
like
that.
you
know?
let's
mediate
a
deal.
but
remember
they've
been
fighting
each
other
for
hundreds
of
"years,"
and
we
were
artificially
put
"there,"
in
this
case
by
president
obama.
so
we
did
our
job.
we
knocked
out.
and
i'll
tell
you
another
"thing,"
we
have
to
be
treated
fairly.
we
have
to
be
treated
fairly.
we're
not
treated
fairly
by
other
nations.
we
captured
"many,"
many
isis
fighters.
most
of
them
came
from
europe.
they
came
from
germany.
they
came
from
france.
they
came
from
all
of
these
countries.
and
we
called
"them,"
i
called
them
myself
in
many
"cases,"
i
"said,"
"\"take"
your
"fighters.\""
they
"said,"
"\"we"
don't
want
them.
you
take
"them.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
we
did
you
a
big
favor.
they're
citizens
of
germany.
they're
citizens
of
france.
they're
citizens
of
these
various
countries
in
europe.
take
your
"fighters.\""
"\"we"
don't
want
"them,"
sir.
we
don't
want
them.'
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
unfair
are
we
treated?
we
do
them
a
great
"favor,"
and
they
won't
take
the
"fighters.\""
so
we're
doing
some
things
that
are
pretty
amazing.
every
once
in
a
while
you
have
to
change
"course,"
and
do
what
you
have
to
do.
the
united
states
has
spent
$8
trillion
in
the
middle
east.
we've
lost
thousands
of
brave
"soldiers,"
and
tens
of
thousands
of
terribly
wounded
"people,"
great
"people,"
their
lives
will
never
be
the
same.
these
wars
produced
only
chaos
and
bloodshed.
and
all
of
the
blood
and
treasure
we
"sacrificed,"
made
the
middle
"east,"
really
it's
less
"safe,"
it's
less
"stable,"
and
it's
less
secure.
and
i
say
it
all
the
time.
the
single
greatest
mistake
our
country
made
in
its
history
was
going
in
to
the
quicksand
of
the
middle
east.
we
spent
$8
trillion
and
lost
thousands
of
lives.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
other
"side,"
we
can
talk
about
"that,"
lost
millions
of
lives.
what
did
we
do?
so
we're
going
to
pull
them
"out,"
and
we're
pulling
people
"out,"
and
we're
trying
to
make
good
"deals,"
and
we're
going
to
bring
our
soldiers
back
"home,"
and
we
may
need
them
for
something
"else,"
and
they'll
be
ready.
previous
administrations
lust
for
regime
"change,"
and
also
put
historic
christian
communities
in
vastly
more
danger
than
they
were
before
we
started.
they
are
some
of
the
biggest
victims
of
these
power
vacuums
and
reckless
foreign
adventures.
the
"christians,"
the
christians.
and
we
work
hard
with
the
christians.
we
have
tremendous
evangelical
support.
we
work
hard
with
the
christians.
so
we're
slowly
getting
out
of
the
middle
east.
we're
doing
it
carefully.
and
we're
rebuilding
our
military
like
we
have
never
rebuilt
our
military
before.
when
i
came
into
"office,"
a
very
prominent
general
told
"me,"
because
it
looked
like
we
could
have
a
big
conflict
with
"someone,"
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
no
"ammunition.\""
we
had
old
planes.
we
had
planes
that
were
so
"old,"
they
didn't
fly.
we
had
people
going
to
the
"desert,"
the
plane
"graveyards,"
airplane
"graveyards,"
picking
up
parts.
i
never
want
to
hear
a
president
of
the
united
states
hear
those
words
again.
i
never
want
to
have
a
president
hear
the
"words,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
no
"ammunition.\""
think
of
that.
think
of
that.
"now,"
thanks
to
more
than
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollar
worth
of
investment
in
our
"military,"
we
have
more
"ammunition,"
more
"missiles,"
more
"rockets,"
more
"tanks,"
more
fighter
"jets,"
and
more
of
everything
else
than
we've
ever
had
before.
and
we
have
no
choice.
you
look
around
the
"world,"
and
we
have
no
"choice,"
unfortunately.
and
the
democrats
want
to
dismantle
our
military.
after
years
of
building
up
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
building
up
our
country.
that's
what
we
have
to
do.
we're
replacing
the
disaster
known
as
nafta
with
the
brand
new
u.s.-mexico-canada
"agreement,"
"usmca,"
a
giant
victory
for
our
"farmers,"
"ranchers,"
workers
in
minnesota.
congress
should
pass
usmca
immediately.
we
hope
that
nancy
pelosi
can
start
thinking
about
passing
some
legislation
instead
of
thinking
about
nonsense.
and
to
protect
our
industrial
"backbone,"
i
placed
tariffs
on
foreign
aluminum
and
foreign
steel.
i'm
also
fighting
back
against
years
of
chronic
trade
abuse
from
china.
and
the
supply
chain
of
"china,"
which
was
"unbreakable,"
is
now
breaking
wide
open.
and
they
understand
that.
and
i
don't
blame
china
for
what's
taken
place
over
the
last
25
years.
i
blame
the
people
that
led
our
country
that
let
that
"happen,"
where
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
a
year
was
taken
from
our
country
to
build
china.
it's
not
china's
fault.
in
the
previous
"administration,"
they
put
our
nation's
natural
resources
under
lock
and
"key,"
including
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres
in
a
place
called
superior
national
forest.
last
"year,"
i
traveled
to
duluth
and
announced
that
we
would
be
ending
this
"injustice,"
reopening
superior
national
"forest,"
and
restoring
mineral
exploration
for
the
iron
ore
mines
of
minnesota.
tremendous
jobs.
and
now
the
iron
range
is
back
in
business.
the
last
time
i
was
"here,"
a
man
came
up
to
"me,"
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
president
obama
took
our
heart
"away,"
took
our
life
away.'
i'll
never
forget
it.
a
"man,"
strong
"guy,"
had
tears
in
his
eyes.
he
"said,"
"\"you"
gave
us
back
our
"life,\""
because
they
took
it
away
from
him.
we
gave
it
back.
best
iron
ore
there
is
anywhere.
my
administration
is
also
fighting
the
democrat
socialist
healthcare
agenda
that
would
obliterate
medicare.
republicans
will
protect
"medicare,"
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
and
for
those
of
you
that
have
private
"healthcare,"
health
"insurance,"
180
million
"people,"
they
are
going
to
end
"it,"
obliterate
"it,"
and
most
people
are
thrilled
with
it.
we
are
going
to
leave
it.
you're
going
to
have
your
plan
the
way
you
want
it.
and
there's
no
plan
like
those
plans.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
to
the
moment
of
birth.
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
"abortion,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
washington
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
it's
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
you
remember
that?
"gee,"
i'm
"sorry,"
i'm
so
sorry.
now
you
have
a
president
who's
standing
up
for
"america,"
we
are
standing
up
for
"minneapolis,"
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
state
of
minnesota.
we
begin
this
political
campaign
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
"agenda,"
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
america.
we
begin
this
campaign
with
right
now
almost
three
years
of
perhaps
the
most
successful
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country.
"together,"
we
will
help
millions
more
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
from
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
from
poverty
to
prosperity.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
"reelect,"
and
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
"fair,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
ensure
more
products
are
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
phrase
made
in
the
usa.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
"cancer,"
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
within
10
years.
nobody
thought
that
could
be
done.
going
to
be
done.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
and
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
"work,"
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
great
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
trust.
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
patriots
who
built
this
country
into
the
greatest
nation
ever
to
exist
in
history.
our
ancestors
crossed
the
"oceans,"
settled
a
"continent,"
tamed
the
"wilderness,"
revolutionized
"industry,"
pioneered
"science,"
won
two
world
"wars,"
defeated
fascism
and
"communism,"
and
put
a
man
on
the
face
of
the
moon.
proud
citizens
like
the
people
of
minnesota
helped
build
this
"country,"
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
with
your
"help,"
your
"devotion,"
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"working,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"fighting,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
america
is
thriving
like
never
before.
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
"minnesota,"
i
will
tell
you
this
with
great
"certainty,"
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
thank
you
very
much.
and
just
in
"concluding,"
together
we
will
make
america
wealthy
"again,"
we
will
make
america
strong
"again,"
we
will
make
america
safe
"again,"
and
we
will
make
america
great
again.
thank
"you,"
minnesota.
thank
you.]
[
"wow,"
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
new
mexico.
thank
you.
we
love
being
with
you.
we
love
being
with
you.
incredible
"people,"
incredible
people.
thank
you
very
much.
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
here
in
albuquerque
with
thousands
of
"hard-working,"
freedom-loving
american
patriots.
thank
you.
incredible.
we're
all
united
by
the
same
love
of
our
great
country.
and
by
the
"way,"
our
country
is
doing
great.
you
see
it.
the
same
devotion
to
family
and
the
same
profound
faith
that
america
is
blessed
"by,"
the
eternal
grace
of
almighty
god.
good
night
to
that
person.
tomorrow
they'll
"say,"
"\"massive"
"protest.\""
"no,"
one
person
just
going
home
to
mommy
a
little
bit
sooner.
good
night.
but
we're
bound
by
these
convictions.
we
will
campaign
for
every
"vote,"
and
we
will
win
the
great
state
of
new
mexico
in
2020.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
outside
who
can't
get
in.
so
we
love
"you,"
we
love
"you,"
we
appreciate
it.
we
try
to
get
the
biggest
arena
we
can
"get,"
and
they're
never
big
"enough,"
frankly.
so
there's
something
going
on.
and
i
always
"say,"
"2016,"
i
don't
know
if
there'll
ever
be
another
2016.
but
right
now
it's
like
a
great
tree
or
a
great
"plant,"
you
plant
it
and
it
has
to
take
hold.
we
have
to
win
2020.
we're
doing
so
well.
we
have
to
win
2020.
and
every
"day,"
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
"do,"
we're
battling
against
the
corrupt
establishment
of
the
"past,"
and
we're
achieving
historic
victories
for
the
american
people.
we're
winning
again.
we're
winning
"again,"
and
we're
winning
big.
we're
winning
big.
crucially
for
your
"state,"
we
have
ended
the
last
administration's
war
on
american
energy.
and
since
my
"election,"
natural
gas
"productions,"
big
story
"today,"
in
new
mexico
has
increased
by
"40%,"
4-0.
and
that
means
great
"wages,"
and
it
means
jobs.
and
that's
why
you're
breaking
every
single
record
in
your
state's
book.
crude
oil
production
in
new
mexico
has
more
than
"doubled,"
and
going
up
a
lot
higher
very
quickly.
and
your
state's
energy
revenues
are
up
by
nearly
two-thirds.
think
of
that.
two-thirds.
and
that's
in
a
short
period
of
time.
give
me
a
little
bit
more
"time,"
okay?
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of

and
this
means
more
"jobs,"
higher
"wages,"
and
american
energy
"independence,"
which
is
what
we
have.
a
few
years
"ago,"
if
we
had
a
problem
like
you
saw
two
days
ago
in
the
middle
"east,"
we
would've
been
in
a
panic.
"although,"
not
if
i
were
your
president.
we
never
panic.
we
don't
want
to
panic.
but
a
few
years
"ago,"
they
would
have
been
in
a
panic.
today
we
got
a
lot
of
"oil,"
we
got
a
lot
of
gas.

got
a
lot
of
oil
and

we
don't
have
to
send
too
many

over
there.
did
you
notice
the
other
"day,"
they
were
"saying,"
"\"we"
don't
see
too
many
american
ships
"anymore.\""
you
know
why?
because
we
don't
need
…
we're
"independent,"
as
independent
as
we
want.
and
we
are
now
a
net
exporter
of
energy.
revenues
from
energy
production
provide
up
to
25%
of
your
state's
budget
and
going
much
higher
in
the
very
near
future.
and
they've
generated
nearly
a
billion-dollar
budget
surplus
in
new
mexico.

you
very
"much,"

thank
you.
"now,"
under
the

all

can
forget
it.

they'll
call
us
"\"the"
hermit
"nation.\""
we'll
never
leave
our
house.
"no,"
it's
crazy.
but
that's
okay.
i
don't
want
to
bring
it
up
because
i
don't
want
to
do
it
too
early.
maybe
they'll
"change,"
and
i
don't
want
them
to
change.
but
think
of
it
for
"you,"
and
for
"texas,"
and
for
so
many
other
"places,"
they
want
to
get
rid
of
your
energy.
i
"mean,"
explain
that
one.
explain
that.
"yet,"
every
major
democrat
running
for
"president,"
they
want
to
abolish
all
production
of
oil
and
natural
gas.
in
other
"words,"
the
democrats
want
to
completely
annihilate
new
mexico's
economy.
the
democrats
want
us
to
be
subservient
to
foreign
producers.
they
want
us
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
rogue
regimes.
that's
not
happening
anymore.
it's
been
a
long
time.
it's
been
a
long
time.
it's
not
happening
anymore.
but
democrats
will
never
get
the
chance
because
new
mexico
will
never
give
them
that
chance.
under
this
"administration,"
america
is
working
again.
america
is
winning
again.
and
america
is
respected
"again,"
like
it
hasn't
been
for
a
long
time.
and
i
can
tell
you
because
i
meet
so
many
of
the
"leaders,"
and
their
"presidents,"
and
their
"kings,"
and
their
"queens,"
and
their
prime
"ministers,"
and
their
"everything,"
dictators
every
once
in
a
while.
every
once
in
a
"while,"
you
get
an
a
rogue
dictator.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
they
always
start
"off,"
today
i
had
the
crown
prince
of
"bahrain,"
and
they
come
in
and
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
i'd
like
to
congratulate
you
on
what
you've
done
with
the
economy
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
model
for
the
entire
"world.\""
they
all
say
it.
and
earlier
today
…
do
we
have
any
baseball
fans?
right?
right?
you
know
what
i'm
going
to
say.
but
earlier
today
in
the
white
"house,"
i
had
the
honor
of
awarding
the
presidential
medal
of
"freedom,"
that's
the
highest
civilian
"award,"
to
someone
who
truly
embodies
the
american
"dream,"
baseball
"legend,"
the
"greatest,"
by
the
"way,"
the
greatest
relief
pitcher
of
all
"time,"
you
look
at
those
"records,"
mariano
rivera.
he
was
something.
the
yankees
won
a
lot
of
world
series
because
of
mariano.
great
guy.
we
gave
him
the
medal.
done
so
much
for
charity.
a
fantastic
"man,"
fantastic
family.
it
was
a
beautiful
day
at
the
white
"house,"
so
it
was
good.
my
administration
is
fighting
to
empower
all
americans
to
reach
their
dreams
and
achieve
their
potential.
we
have
created
six
million
new
jobs
since
election
day.
the
fake
news
would
never
have
allowed
us
to
say
that
during
the
"campaign,"
even
as
a
projection.
unemployment
recently
reached
its
lowest
rate
in
over
50
years.
more
than
seven
million
americans
have
been
lifted
off
of
food
stamps.
nearly
"600,000"
americans
came
into
the
labor
force
last
month
alone.
think
of
that.
wages
in
your
"state,"
new
"mexico,"
are
growing
at
a
rate
of
much
more
than
3%
a
"year,"
which
is
unheard
of
20
years
ago.
and
i
used
to
say
during
the
"campaign,"
you
go
"back,"
it's
hard
to
"believe,"
i'm
here
almost
three
years
…
can
you
believe
how
time
is
flying?
can
you
believe
it?
i
don't
know
about
it
"me,"
but
you
look
all
much
better
than
you
did
three
years
ago.
you're
wealthier.
and
even
with
the
me
too
"movement,"
we
can't
say
"this,"
but
i'll
say
it
"anyway,"
you're
better
"looking,"
including
the
"men,"
including
the
men.
now
you're
all
looking
good.
since
my
"election,"
the
number
of
new
business
applications
for
new
mexico
has
increased
by
almost
"30%,"
more
than
any
state
in
the
united
states.
think
of
that.
more
than
any
state
in
the
united
states.
so
"essentially,"
that's
saying
you're
in
a
certain
"category,"
which
is
a
very
important
"category,"
you're
doing
better
than
any
state
in
the
united
states.
how
do
i
lose
new
mexico?
explain
that
"one,"
right?
how
do
we
lose
that
one?
and
"yet,"
for
whatever
"reason,"
it's
been
quite
a
while
since
a
republican
won
this
state.
but
we're
going
to
win
this
state.
and
i
think
we're
going
to
win
this
state
easy.
you
had
to
see
the
people
all
the
way
in
from
the
airport.
that
was
a
long
drive
by
the
"way,"
35
minutes.
that
was
a
long
drive.
but
all
the
way
"in,"
we
had
"people,"
and
they
were
waving.
and
i
didn't
see
any
negative
hand
"gesture,"
right?
"no,"
i
think
we're
going
to
do
great
here.
and
we're
here
for
a
number
of
"reasons,"
but
we're
here
because
we
really
think
we're
going
to
turn
this
state
and
make
it
a
republican
state.
yesterday
marked
the
beginning
of
the
hispanic
heritage
month.
who
is
hispanic
here?
latinos
for
trump.
thank
you.
incredible
people.
but
we
have
much
to
celebrate.
unbelievable
when
you
"think,"
the
unemployment
for
hispanic-americans
is
right
now
at
the
lowest
level
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
country.
hispanic-american
poverty
reached
a
brand
new
all-time
low
in
history.
and
after
years
of
stagnation
that
you
know
very
"well,"
wages
for
hispanic-americans
are
rising
really
"fast,"
up
nearly
8%
since
my
election.
those
are
unheard
of
numbers.
they're
unheard
of.
and
median
"income,"
think
of
"that,"
median
income
for
hispanic-americans
surpassed
"$50,000"
for
the
first
time
ever.
that's
your
median.
that's
not
bad.
that
means
you're
wealthy
and
you're
getting
wealthier
fast.
and
i
just
want
to
tell
you
it's
an
honor.
but
when
i'm
on
the
debate
stage
debating
one
of
these
far
left
radical
"democrats,"
whoever
it
may
"be,"
and
they
start
telling
you
what
they're
going
to
do
for
"you,"
and
you
"say,"
"\"but"
we
have
the
best
"numbers,"
every
"category,"
that
we've
ever
"had.\""
hispanic-americans
…
excuse
"me,"
new
mexico
as
a
"whole,"
we
have
the
best
numbers.
"african-americans,"
the
best
numbers
that
we've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
our
country.
"asian-americans,"
the
best
numbers
that
we've
ever
had
in
history.
"women,"
the
best
numbers
that
we've
had
in
71
years.
we're
working
night
and
day
to
deliver
a
future
of
limitless
opportunity
for
our
nation's
hispanic-american
"citizens,"
including
millions
and
millions
of
extraordinary
mexican-americans
who
enrich
our
"society,"
strengthen
our
"country,"
serve
in
our
"military,"
and
contribute
immensely
to
our
shared
american
family.
and
i
want
to
just
tell
you
that
mexico
is
doing
a
great
job
for
us
on
the
"border,"
and
i
want
to
thank
the
president
of
mexico.
you
"know,"
it's
very
"interesting,"
i
hear
everybody
"screaming,"
"well,"
you
know
we're
building
the
"wall,"
and
it's
going
"up,"
and
it's
going
up
fast.
and
if
you
think
that's
easy
with
the
democrats
who
control
the
"house,"
we
have
to
take
it
"back,"
but
if
you
think
it's
easy
…
but
we're
building
a
lot
of
wall.
we'll
have
almost
500
miles
of
wall
built
by
the
end
the
next
"year,"
and
it's
making
a
big
difference.
500
miles.
but
you
know
we
won
a
big
case
two
months
ago
in
the
supreme
court
that
allowed
us
to
do
what
we're
doing.
this
has
been
…
i'll
tell
you
what.
ready?
another
president
would
have
given
up
a
long
time
ago.
we
don't
give
up.
so
we're
building
the
"wall,"
the
army
corps
of
"engineers,"
we're
doing
a
beautiful
job.
it's
a
"great,"
it's
a
great
structure.
it's
a
great
structure.
you're
going
to
have
to
really
want
to
get
over
that
"wall,"
to
do
it.
but
it
was
very
interesting
"because,"
not
too
long
"ago,"
i
saw
where
the
"hispanic-american,"
the
"hispanics,"
were
up
with
me
in
a
"poll,"
17%.
and
everyone
"said,"
"\"how"
is
that?
how
is
that?
how
is
that?
17%.
up
by
17%.
i
won't
even
tell
you
what
the
final
number
was
because
they
won't
believe
"it,"
but
you're
going
to
see
what
the
final
number
…
but
you
know
why?
because
the
"hispanic-americans,"
they
"understand,"
they
don't
want
criminals
coming
across
the
border.
they
don't
want
people
taking
their
jobs.
they
want
to
have
that
"security,"
and
they
want
the
wall.
they
want
the
wall.
and
we
have
a
man
in
the
audience
who
"is,"
i
"think,"
the
best
dressed
man
in
this
entire
"place,"
including
"me,"
right
here.
look
at
him.
come
here.
look
at
him.
look
at
this
guy.
and
he's
been
to
a
couple
of
rallies
"too,"
haven't
you?
huh?
we
have
some
"people,"
a
group
of
people
the
other
"day,"
you
"know,"
we
had
a
victory
in
north
carolina
that
was
unbelievable.
two
of
them.
one
of
"them,"
it
was
going
to
be
"very,"
very
close.
here's
another
one
of
my
friends.
thank
you.
i
like
that
beautiful
red
tie
you're
wearing.
but
we
had
a
"victory,"
two
"victories,"
north
"carolina,"
where
one
was
17
points
down
three
weeks
"ago,"
we
got
"involved,"
we
started
sending
out
lots
of
different
social
media
"messages,"
we
did
a
couple
of
little
robo
"calls,"
but
the
big
"thing,"
we
did
a
speech
the
night
before.
the
turnout
was
beyond
belief.
and
instead
of
being
down
by
17
"points,"
he
easily
won
the
election
"4,000"
or
"5,000"
votes.
"dan,"
thank
"you,"
dan.
thank
"you,"
dan
bishop.
and
greg
murphy
was
up
a
couple
of
"points,"
and
he
ended
up
"winning,"
i
don't
"know,"
i'd
ask
the
"media,"
but
they
won't
give
me
how
many
…
what
did
he
get?
do
you
know?
like
"20,"
21?
he
won
by
a
lot.
he
won
by
a
lot.
i'd
asked
"them,"
but
we're
not
going
to
get
a
straight
answer.
they
were
not
happy.
they
were
not
happy.
i'll
tell
"you,"
tuesday
"night,"
the
fake
news
was
not
happy.
they
had
their
studios
all
built.
cnn
had
their
a-
list
talent.
they
don't
have
a-list
"talent,"
but
they
had
the
best
they
could
have.
and
they
were
all
set.
this
was
going
to
be
the
end
of
"trump,"
because
this
man
was
going
to
lose.
but
he
turned
out
to
be
tough
and
smart.
and
in
all
"fairness,"
i
helped
a
lot
too.
and
toward
the
end
of
the
"night,"
they
started
dismantling
that
studio.
probably
it
would
have
been
there
for
four
weeks.
this
is
the
end.
but
we
had
two
great
"victories,"
congressional
"victories,"
on
tuesday
night.
and
it
was
something.
the
one
gentleman
won
by
a
number
that
nobody
thought
even
"possible,"
so
much.
and
the
other
won
a
race
that
he
was
"way,"
"way,"
way
back.
in
"fact,"
i
shouldn't
tell
you
"this,"
but
my
"geniuses,"
my
"people,"
some
of
those
people
standing
right
"there,"
right
"there,"
some
of
them
right
"there,"
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
don't
get
involved
in
that
"race,"
sir.
you
can't
come
back
from
17
"points,"
sir.
it's
too
"much.\""
i
"said,"
"\"but"
you
"know,"
i
really
like
the
guy.
i
think
he's
great.
let's
give
it
a
"shot.\""
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
if
you
"lose,"
they
will
"never,"
ever
…
it'll
be
much
"worse.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
tell
"you,"
i
know
them
very
well.
whether
i
help
him
or
don't
help
"him,"
it's
going
to
be
the
same.
it's
going
to
be
a
disaster.
so
let's
help
"him.\""
and
we
"campaigned,"
and
we
worked
"hard,"
right?
they
"said,"
"\"don't"
do
"it,"
sir.
don't
do
it.
please
don't
do
"it,"
sir.
it'll
be
very
"embarrassing.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
don't
mind
being
embarrassed.
i
don't
mind
being
"embarrassed.\""
we're
also
very
proud
that
unemployment
among
native
americans
has
reached
the
lowest
rate
in
nearly
two
decades.
and
we're
building
an
amazing
future
for
citizens
of
every
"background,"
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
and
that's
what
we
have.
that's
what
we
have.
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
but
the
radical
left
democrats
want
to
demolish
everything
that
we've
gained.
they
want
to
raise
your
taxes.
they
want
to
bury
you
in
regulation.
they
want
to
take
away
your
health
"insurance,"
180
million
americans.
they
want
to
erase
american
"history,"
crush
religious
"liberty,"
indoctrinate
our
students
with
left-wing
ideology.
and
left-wing
democrats
want
to
confiscate
your
guns
and
eliminate
your
god-given
right
to
self-defense.
you
know
that.
as
your
"president,"
i
will
never
allow
them
to
take
away
your
"liberty,"
your
"dignity,"
and
your
social
security.
and
i
will
"never,"
ever
allow
them
to
take
away
your
sacred
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
the
left
tries
to
"threaten,"
"bully,"
intimidate
americans
into
submission.
they
use
democrat
prosecutors
and
phony
congressional
committees
whenever
they
can.
they'll
do
whatever
they
can
to
demean
"you,"
to
libel
you.
they
try
to
"blacklist,"
"coerce,"
"cancel,"
or
destroy
anyone
who
gets
in
their
way.
look
at
what
they're
doing
today
to
justice
kavanaugh.
look
at
what
they're
doing.
did
you
see
the
new
york
times?
did
you
see
what
they're
doing?
did
you
see
what
"democrats,"
they're
calling
for
his
resignation.
they're
calling
for
his
impeachment.
and
the
woman
involved
said
she
didn't
know
anything.
but
they
"still,"
so
the
new
york
times
had
to
put
out
a
major
"apology,"
and
they
had
to
change
their
story.
the
woman
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
remember
"that.\""
can
you
believe?
and
they
still
want
him
to
be
impeached.
and
i
just
put
out
a
statement.
and
he's
a
great
"man,"
by
the
"way,"
a
great
talent.
a
great
brilliant
"man,"
brett
kavanaugh.
and
i
just
put
out
a
statement
on
social
media
that
"said,"
i
don't
think
they'll
do
"it,"
but
they
"should,"
for
the
good
of
the
"nation,"
"\"i"
call
for
the
resignation
of
everybody
at
the
new
york
times
involved
in
the
kavanaugh
smear
"story.\""
and
while
you're
at
"it,"
the
russian
witch-hunt
"hoax,"
which
is
just
as
phony
a
story.
they've
"taken,"
the
old
gray
"lady,"
do
you
know
the
new
york
"times,"
for
"years,"
the
old
gray
"lady,"
so
"prestigious,"
they've
taken
the
old
great
lady
and
broken
her
"down,"
destroyed
her
"virtue,"
and
ruined
her
reputation.
she
can
never
"recover,"
and
will
never
return
to
greatness
under
current
management.
the
times
is
dead.
long
live
the
new
york
times.
long
lived
the
new
york
times.
and
i
do
want
it
to
"live,"
but
they
have
to
"be,"
they
have
to
change
their
ways.
think
of
"it,"
they
wrote
a
story
about
somebody
that
said
she
doesn't
remember
this.
can
you
even
believe
it?
and
"yet,"
all
of
these
radical
left
crazies
are
in
judiciary
committee
and
all
of
these
committees
that
are
set
up
to
hurt
the
country.
with
all
that
we
have
"going,"
with
saudi
"arabia,"
with
"iran,"
with
china
trade
"deal,"
with
"russia,"
with
north
"korea,"
with
all
that
we
have
"going,"
look
at
the
cards
that
we've
been
"dealt,"
lucky
we
won
the
election
in
"2016,"
believe
me.
with
all
that
we
have
"going,"
they
"say,"
"\"let's"
impeach
justice
"kavanaugh,\""
one
of
the
"smartest,"
most
brilliant
"students,"
top
at
"yale,"
incredible
"life,"
incredible
family.
"\"let's"
impeach
"him.\""
it's
a
made-up
story.
"\"let's"
impeach
president
"trump.\""
think
of
that.
the
muller
report
came
out.
think
of
this.
this
crazy
mueller
report
comes
"out,"
18
trump
"haters,"
liberal
"democrats,"
some
worked
for
hillary
"clinton,"
they
found
nothing.
"no,"
think
of
it.
after
two
"years,"
they
found
nothing.
they
spent
$40
million.
there's
not
a
person
in
the
room
that
i
couldn't
find
something
on
with
that.
they
"spent,"
think
of
"it,"
they
found
nothing.
no
"collusion,"
no
"obstruction,"
no
nothing.
to
stop
the
far
left's
campaign
of
"destruction,"
you
must
vote
republican.
and
you're
going
to
get
the
chance
very
soon.
we're
joined
tonight
by
many
terrific
republican
"leaders,"
and
somebody
that's
done
an
incredible
"job,"
she
ran
michigan
for
me.
and
as
you
"know,"
for
the
presidential
"races,"
michigan
hadn't
been
won
in
"decades,"
and
she
kept
"saying,"
"\"could"
you
come
"back,"
"sir?\""
i
didn't
know
who
she
was.
i
"said,"
"\"who"
the
heck
is
the
woman
in
michigan
that
keeps
"asking?\""
she
"said,"
"\"sir,"
if
you
keep
coming
"back,"
you're
going
to
win
"michigan.\""
hasn't
been
won
in
decades.
and
i
won
michigan.
remember
that
"great,"
great
night?
november.
that
"great,"
great
night.
"\"donald"
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
"michigan.\""
and
they
were
going
crazy
on
television.
they
were
"going,"
that
was
not
a
good
night-
going
crazy
on
television.
they
were
"going,"
that
was
not
a
good
night
for
certain
people.
remember
the
couple
of
people
that
were
crying?
i
guess
they
don't
like
a
strong
military.
they
don't
like
cutting
regulations.
they
don't
like
low
taxes.
they
don't
like
right
to
"try,"
you
know
right
to
try.
all
these
things
we've
done.
for
the
"vets,"
we
got
choice.
we
got
choice
for
the
vets.
choice.
everybody
said
it
was
impossible.
we've
rebuilt
our
military.
i
told
this
story
for
the
first
time
today.
a
general
came
into
my
office
in
my
first
few
"weeks,"
you
remember?
it
was
a
little
dangerous
out
there.
president
obama
left
us
with
a
few
"beauties,"
right?
and
i
said
to
this
"general,"
"\"you"
better
be
"prepared,"
because
this
is
looking
like
it
could
really
be
"conflict.\""
and
he
looked
at
me
and
he
"goes,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
very
little
"ammunition.\""
i
"said,"
"\"say"
it
"again.\""
and
i
want
to
tell
you
the
"words,"
very
"little,"
he
didn't
use
because
it
was
less
than
that.
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
never
want
to
see
a
president
in
a
position
like
"that,"
where
we
may
have
"conflict,"
and
a
general
looks
at
him
and
"said,"
‘we
have
very
little/
no
"ammunition.'\""
i
never
want
a
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
in
that
position.
and
since
"then,"
three
"years,"
$700
billion
we've
"spent,"
then
$716
billion.
and
"now,"
$738
billion.
and
our
military
is
by
far
the
greatest
in
the
world.
there's
nobody
that
even
comes
close.
so
"anyway,"
no
president
should
ever
be
put
in
that
position.
and
by
the
"way,"
no
president
should
ever
have
to
go
through
what
i've
gone
through
either.
that
should
never
happen.
what
happened
is
a
disgrace
to
our
country.
no
president
should
ever
have
to
go
through
it.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
99%
of
them
would
never
have
been
able
to
take
it.
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
take
it.
but
we
won
the
great
state
of
"michigan,"
and
now
we're
doing
really
"well,"
because
we've
moved
a
lot
of
car
companies.
i
tell
"japan,"
"sorry,"
big
deficits
with
all
these
"countries,"
we're
changing
"it,"
but
you've
got
to
get
car
companies.
we're
building
car
companies
now
in
michigan.
they're
not
going
to
be
leaving
for
lots
of
other
"countries,"
including
"china,"
including
mexico.
they're
going
to
stay
"home,"
and
they're
going
to
pay
you
a
lot
of
"money,"
and
everybody's
going
to
be
happy.
but
michigan's
doing
great.
and
ronna
mcdaniel
was
the
republican
party
chair
of
michigan.
so
when
we
won
the
"election,"
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
get
the
woman
from
michigan
to
run
the
"rnc.\""
and
she
has
done
an
incredible
job.
thank
you
ronna.
a
great
gentleman
who
loves
the
republican
"party,"
"co-chairman,"
tommy
hicks.
"tommy,"
what
a
job.
new
mexico
republican
party
chairman.
steve
pearce.
my
friend
and
a
really
talented
"guy,"
he
just
gets
the
hell
knocked
out
of
him
all
the
time.
brad
parscale.
what
a
job
he's
"doing,"
brad.
great
"job,"
brad.
great
job.
and
another
great
friend
of
"mine,"
somebody
that
was
on
"cnn,"
and
they
didn't
like
him
because
he
was
too
positive
on
trump.
can
you
believe
it?
he
happens
to
be
hispanic.
he
happens
to
be
"hispanic,"
but
i've
never
quite
figured
it
"out,"
because
he
looks
more
like
a
wasp
than
i
do.
so
i
haven't
figured
that
one
out.
but
i'll
tell
you
what.
there
is
nobody
that
loves
his
country
more
or
hispanic
more
than
steve
"cortez,"
steve.
thank
you
steve.
nobody
loves
the
hispanics
more.
who
do
you
like
"more,"
the
country
or
the
hispanics?
he
says
the
country.
i
don't
know.
i
may
have
to
go
for
the
hispanics
to
be
honest.
we
got
a
lot
of
hispanics.
we
love
our
hispanics.
get
out
and
vote.
you
"know,"
just
before
the
last
"election,"
the
cubans
from
miami
where
we
got
a
tremendous
percentage
of
the
"vote,"
close
to
90%.
they
gave
me
the
bay
of
pigs
award.
can
you
"imagine,"
right?
the
bay
of
pigs
award.
and
the
venezuelans
and
the
cubans
are
all
for
"trump,"
i
will
tell
you
that.
they're
all
for
trump.
they
like
what
we're
doing.
with
the
help
"of,"
and
"steve,"
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
by
the
"way,"
and
you
were
incredible
on
"cnn,"
and
now
you'll
get
a
real
job.
okay?
"steve,"
that
audience
wasn't
big
enough
for
you.
their
ratings
aren't
good.
with
the
help
of
everyone
here
"tonight,"
we're
taking
power
out
of
washington
and
giving
it
back
to
the
great
people
of
our
"country,"
and
to
the
people
of
new
mexico.
we've
cut
a
record
number
of
job-killing
"regulations,"
saving
the
average
american
household
"$3,000."
we
passed
the
largest
package
of
tax
cuts
and
reforms
in
american
history.
what
that
means
is
a
typical
family
of
four
in
new
mexico
making
"$75,000"
has
seen
their
tax
bill
reduced
by
more
than
"$2,000."
and
it's
one
of
the
reasons
that
as
the
world
is
not
doing
"great,"
you
look
at
"europe,"
and
you
look
at
"asia,"
and
china's
not
doing
too
well.
i
must
be
honest
with
"you,"
worst
year
in
57
"years,"
i'd
say
that's
not
good.
but
i
hope
they
still
like
me.
and
we've
taken
in
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
"tariffs,"
and
we've
given
those
"tariffs,"
and
by
the
"way,"
china's
eating
the
"tariffs,"
they're
devaluing
their
"currency,"
the
prices
are
very
similar.
they're
eating
the
tariffs.
and
out
of
the
tens
of
billions
we
gave
our
great
"farmers,"
because
they
were
targeted
by
"china,"
because
china
"knows,"
very
"smart,"
that
the
farmers
love
"trump,"
and
trump
loves
the
farmers.
i
said
to
our
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
sonny
"perdue,"
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
how
much
did
the
farmers
get
hit
by
china
targeting
them
and
pulling
back
and
doing
all
sorts
of
"things?\""
he
"said,"
"\"$16"
"billion.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
okay.
we'll
take
$16
billion
out
of
a
"much,"
"much,"
much
larger
number.
we're
going
to
give
it
to
the
"farmers,"
so
that
they're
"even.\""
and
i
tell
"you,"
the
farmers
do
love
"trump,"
they
do
love
trump.
and
to
keep
new
mexico's
"farms,"
"ranches,"
and
small
businesses
in
the
"family,"
we
eliminated
the
unfair
estate
tax
or
death
"tax,"
so
that
you
can
now
give
your
farm
or
your
ranch
to
your
children.
"now,"
if
you
don't
like
your
"children,"
don't
do
it.
but
when
it's
your
time
to
kick
the
"bucket,"
you
worked
hard.
you
have
great
"kids,"
you
love
your
"kids,"
they're
taking
care
of
you.
you
really
love
them.
it's
a
great
thing.
if
you
don't
love
"them,"
don't
even
listen
to
the
last
"line,"
because
it
won't
matter.
don't
leave
it
to
them.
if
they're
not
"good,"
leave
it
to
charity.
leave
it
to
something
else.
don't
get
it
to
them.
i
know
a
guy
who
can't
stand
his
"children,"
they're
"horrible,"
horrible
human
beings.
they're
a
little
older
"now,"
but
they're
horrible
human
beings.
he
wants
to
leave
his
wealth.
i
"said,"
"\"why"
would
you
leave
them?
they
don't
even
like
"you.\""
but
on
the
assumption
that
you
love
your
"children,"
you'll
be
able
to
use
small
farms
and
your
ranches
and
things.
you'll
be
able
to
leave
them
to
your
children.
your
children
won't
have
to
go
out
and
borrow
a
fortune
to
pay
tax.
they
won't
be
losing
it
to
the
banks
five
years
later.
we
got
rid
of
it.
that's
a
big
deal.
thank
you.
thank
you.
our
shared
republican
agenda
is
"pro-worker,"
"pro-jobs,"
"pro-family,"
"pro-growth,"
and
100%
pro-american.
for
many
"decades,"
our
leaders
put
global
interests
and
special
interests
ahead
of
your
interests.
you
know
"that,"
in
new
"mexico,"
you
know
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about.
people
came
"in,"
they
took
your
"jobs,"
they
had
no
"border,"
they
had
no
border
control.
look
at
what's
going
on
"now,"
how
we're
doing.
i
"mean,"
"honestly,"
i
mentioned
the
president
of
mexico.
we
have
today
"27,000"
mexican
soldiers
on
the
border
protecting
our
country.
and
i'll
take
it.
because
our
laws
are
so
"bad,"
they're
so
pathetic.
and
the
democrats
could
change
these
laws.
they
could
change
them
so
quickly.
we
could
change
them
all
in
less
than
an
hour.
we
"could,"
whether
it's
"asylum,"
whether
it's
any
of
the
"laws,"
we
have
so
many
of
them
that
are
so
bad.
how
they
got
"that,"
it
took
years
and
years
to
end
up.
but
we
have
the
mexican
soldiers
out
there.
you
see
"them,"
and
they're
stopping
people.
the
numbers
are
plummeting
down.
so
i
just
want
to
thank
all
of
the
representatives
of
mexico.
amazing.
"well,"
we've
got
to
get
rid
of
the
loopholes.
you
"know,"
the
word
is
"loopholes,"
and
the
democrats
could
do
it
fast.
but
in
the
"meantime,"
we're
doing
really
well.
and
as
the
wall
goes
"up,"
it
becomes
less
and
less
of
a
"problem,"
because
as
the
wall
gets
"up,"
people
aren't
getting
through.
i
mean
you
got
to
be
a
a
world
class
pole
"vaulter,"
or
a
world
class
mount
everest
type
climber.
there's
not
too
many
around
like
that.
it's
really
doing
the
trick.
the
failed
liberal
establishment
in
washington
squandered
your
tax
"dollars,"
shipped
away
your
"jobs,"
sacrificed
your
"sovereignty,"
and
bogged
us
down
in
one
foreign
"war,"
or
"debacle,"
call
it
whatever
you
want
after
another.
and
that's
changing
"also,"
you
see
what's
"happening,"
and
when
these
rich
countries
think
we're
going
to
pay
for
their
military
every
"year,"
billions
and
billions
and
"billions,"
and
they're
"rich,"
and
they
take
our
business
and
we're
supposed
"to,"
on
top
of
everything
"else,"
i
could
tell
you
"stories,"
but
i'm
going
to
save
them
for
the
campaign.
because
to
be
"honest,"
this
is
a
little
earlier
than
the
campaign.
wait
until
this
campaign
"starts,"
you
"know,"
like
i
was
telling
brad
and
i
was
telling
a
few
of
the
"folks,"
one
thing
i
don't
want
to
"do,"
michael
back
"there,"
"michael,"
hello.
what
a
job
he's
done.
but
i'm
telling
them
i
don't
want
to
do
this
too
early.
i
don't
want
to
do
it.
you
know
the
pocahontas
"thing,"
i
did
"that,"
it
was
before
its
time.
right?
it
was
before
it's
time.
too
early.
"1,024."
that
means
i
have
more
indian
blood
than
she
"does,"
and
i
have
"none,"
unfortunately.
i'd
like
to
say
i
have
a
lot.
got
to
get
me
another
4%.
maybe
another
10%.
but
i
was
early
with
"her,"
and
"frankly,"
oh
it's
coming
"back,"
don't
worry
about
her.
but
those
days
are
over
under
this
administration.
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
putting
it
first.
we're
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
policies
that
ravished
our
industries
and
devastated
communities
all
across
our
land.
you
see
the
"factories,"
empty
"buildings,"
empty
hulks.
some
have
been
"demolished,"
some
have
been
reconverted
into
senior
citizen
housing
and
housing.
but
all
those
jobs
are
"gone,"
and
we're
bringing
them
back.
they're
coming
back
like
almost
never
before.
"probably,"
i
can
say
they're
coming
back
like
never
before.
people
are
coming
back
"now,"
because
they
want
to
be
where
the
action
is.
and
this
is
the
country
where
they
have
the
"security,"
and
where
they
do
have
the
action.
in
my
first
week
in
"office,"
i
proudly
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
job-destroying…
and
this
was
a
catastrophe.
you
"know,"
the
trans-pacific
"partnership,"
"tpp,"
this
would
have
destroyed
the
automobile
business
in
our
country.
now
new
"mexico,"
you
know
that
you
were
totally
devastated
by
another
disaster
known
as
nafta.
your
state
lost
33%
of
its
manufacturing
jobs
after
nafta
was
signed.
this
was
one
of
the
great
catastrophes.
and
now
we're
replacing
nafta
with
the
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
"agreement,"
usmca.
think
of
the
song
ymca.
ymca.
think
of
the
song.
"usmca,"
that's
us-mexico-canada
agreement.
and
it's
drawing
strong
bipartisan
support
from
all
across
your
"state,"
and
all
across
the
country.
it's
amazing.
i
want
to
"just,"
yeah.
the
dona
ana
county
board
of
"commissioners,"
all
democrats
just
unanimously
endorsed
the
"usmca,"
and
urged
congress
to
pass
it
immediately.
thank
you
very
much
commissioners.
all
democrats.
hopefully
they'll
put
it
up
for
a
vote.
nancy
"pelosi,"
they
put
it
up
for
vote.
it's
going
to
be
very
popular.
the
republicans
love
"it,"
and
the
democrats
love
"it,"
and
"frankly,"
labor
loves
it.
unions
love
it.
farmers
"love,"
"love,"
love
"it,"
and
everybody
wants
it.
your
"farmers,"
your
"ranchers,"
everybody
wants
it.
it's
an
incredible
agreement.
and
mexico's
already
passed
"it,"
and
canada's
ready
to
pass
"it,"
soon
as
we
do.
"see,"
they
don't
maybe
trust
"us,"
that's
why.
they
"say,"
"\"why"
aren't
you
passing
it
"now?\""
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
we'll
pass
"it.\""
they're
going
to
pass
it
as
soon
as
we
do.
past
leaders
invited
china
to
freely
loot
and
pillage
the
united
states
economy.
china's
been
taking
out
from
300
billion
to
$500
billion
a
year.
"billion,"
not
million.
billion.
think
of
what
$500
billion
is.
we've
rebuilt
"china,"
but
now
it's
a
different
ball
game.
somebody
had
to
do
something
with
china.
president
obama
should
have
done
it.
presidents
bush
should
have
done
it.
president
clinton
should
have
done
it.
they
all
should
have
done
it.
"frankly,"
they
all
should
have
done
a
lot
of
things
that
we're
doing
right
now.
so
if
you
look
at
"it,"
nobody
did
"it,"
so
i'm
doing
"it,"
and
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
we're
doing
well.
so
now
we're
taking
in
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
from
china.
when
in
the
"past,"
we
never
got
25
cents.
we
never
got
money.
we
never
got
anything.
you
know
what
we
got?
unemployment
and
losses.
and
some
cheap
pencils.
more
than
we
needed.
you
could
do
with
one
less
pencil.
following
decades
of
outsourcing
and
"offshoring,"
our
jobs
and
factories
are
coming
back
home
where
they
belong.
if
foreign
companies
do
not
want
to
pay
our
"tariffs,"
there
is
one
very
simple
solution.
come
and
make
your
product
in
america.
come
and
make
your
product
in
new
mexico.
and
by
the
"way,"
i'm
just
seeing
this
great
group
of
"people,"
this
"spirit,"
is
there
any
place
in
the
world
that's
more
fun
or
more
exciting
than
a
trump
rally?
really?
is
there
anything?
when
you
think
about
"it,"
it's
not
about
fun.
it's
about
achievement.
because
what
we've
achieved
in
the
last
almost
three
years
is
unparalleled.
there's
never
been
an
administration
that
in
the
first
two
and
a
half
years
has
done
what
we've
been
able
to
do
or
achieve.
in
a
few
short
"weeks,"
we'll
be
up
to
"180,"
sounds
"impossible,"
federal
judges
including
court
of
appeals
judges.
because
president
obama
did
us
a
great
favor
when
i
came
"in,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
assume
i
have
no
judges
to
"appoint.\""
no
"sir,"
you
have
138
judges.
138?
didn't
put
them
"up,"
couldn't
get
them
approved.
i
don't
know
what
"happened,"
but
we
started
off
with
"138,"
now
we're
up
to
180.
i
just
signed
my
150th
federal
"judge,"
and
court
of
appeals
"judge,"
and
we
already
have
two
great
supreme
court
"justices,"
"gorsuch,"
and
kavanaugh.
"great,"
great
men.
so
think
of
that.
you
"know,"
you
come
"in,"
and
i've
always
heard
the
most
important
thing
a
president
"does,"
i
disagree
with
this
by
the
"way,"
but
that's
okay.
i
disagree
with
a
lot
of
things.
because
i
think
the
most
important
thing
is
our
"military,"
and
protecting
our
"country,"
right?
but
have
you
listened
to
the
so-called
washington
"elite,"
now
why
are
they
elite?
we
do
better
than
they
"do,"
we're
smarter
than
them.
we
make
more
"money,"
we
have
better
"houses,"
we
have
better
"everything,"
and
then
they
say
the
elite.
that
means
you're
the
super
elite.
i've
always
take
offense
when
somebody
"said,"
"\"president"
trump
is
tired
of
listening
to
the
"elite.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
i'm
more
elite
than
"them.\""
right?
i
think
so.
i
"mean,"
if
we
go
by
the
old
"standards,"
better
"houses,"
better
"schools,"
made
much
more
"money,"
lived
"better,"
had
everything
"going,"
and
then
i
decide
to
run
for
president.
and
i'll
be
"honest,"
while
we
have
to
put
up
with
these
"people,"
and
others
"are,"
it's
incredible.
but
it's
the
greatest
single
decision
i've
ever
"made,"
because
our
country
is
turning
around
so
rapidly.
i
could
not
be
"happier,"
despite
what
they
put
us
all
through.
could
not
be
happier.
after
years
of
building
up
other
"countries,"
we're
finally
building
up
our
country.
isn't
that
nice?
it's
time
to
finally
take
care
of
our
own.
and
we're
all
so
aggressively
combating
the
opioid
"epidemic,"
which
is
horrible.
and
as
a
result
of
our
nonstop
"efforts,"
and
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
"invested,"
last
year
we
saw
the
first
nationwide
decline
in
drug
overdose
"deaths,"
and
it
was
a
very
big
decline
in
nearly
three
decades.
30
years.
and
at
the
center
of
america's
drug
"crisis,"
this
is
where
the
hispanics
know
it
better
than
anybody.
people
"said,"
"\"oh,"
the
hispanics
won't
like
a
"wall.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
think
they're
going
to
love
"it.\""
they
won't
like
border
security.
i
think
they
going
to
love
it.
you
know
why?
because
you
understand
it
better
than
other
"people,"
but
at
the
whole
center
of
this
crisis
is
the
drugs
that
are
pouring
"in,"
and
you
understand
that
when
other
people
don't
understand
it.
the
border
"crisis,"
every
day
dangerous
criminal
cartels
smuggle
vast
quantities
of
lethal
narcotics
across
your
southern
"border,"
including
"heroin,"
"meth,"
"cocaine,"
and
"fentanyl,"
and
we're
stopping
them
now.
you
see
the
kind
of
"numbers,"
we're
getting
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
worth.
we've
had
some
shipments
where
it
could
kill
half
of
the
"country,"
some
of
the
fentanyl
and
some
of
the
"bad,"
really
bad
stuff.
if
it
were
"distributed,"
it
could
"actually,"
has
the
power
to
kill
half
of
the
country.
this
is
like
a
warlike
situation.
that's
why
you're
liking
"trump,"
because
you're
not
going
to
let
that
happen.
if
you
want
to
stop
the
drug
smugglers
and
the
human
"traffickers,"
how
about
the
human
traffic
and
they
traffic
really
for
the
most
part
in
"women,"
that's
what
they
traffic
"in,"
it's
women.
they're
not
trafficking
in
men.
they
capture
"women,"
and
they
bring
them
across
the
open
"borders,"
and
they
don't
go
through
ports
of
"entry,"
where
you
have
guards
standing
there
with
guns
and
rifles
and
everything
else.
they
go
out
into
the
desert
"areas,"
and
they
hang
a
"left,"
or
they
hang
a
right
and
they
come
"in,"
but
now
when
you
have
a
"wall,"
they
can't
do
that.
right?
they
can't
do
that.
and
so
many
of
these
democrats
that
are
against
the
"wall,"
it's
common
sense?
"look,"
you
know
what
i
saw
the
other
day?
where
the
democrats
are
having
their
"convention,"
their
national
"convention,"
they
just
gave
out
a
tremendous
contract.
you
know
what
it's
for?
they're
building
a
big
wall
around
the
"building,"
they're
building
a
big
wall.
a
massive
wall.
we
should
tell
"them,"
open
borders.
let
anybody
come
in.
and
a
few
years
"ago,"
almost
every
one
of
"these,"
they're
on
tape.
that's
the
problem
with
politics.
three
years
"ago,"
they
could
"say,"
"look,"
i
saw
senator
"schumer,"
i
saw
nancy…
i
saw
all
of
them.
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
need
a
wall.
we
must
have
a
"wall.\""
president
"obama,"
"\"we"
must
have
a
wall.
we
must
stop
people
from
coming
into
our
country
illegally.
we
have
to
stop
it.
we
need
a
"wall.\""
"now,"
a
few
years
"later,"
they
don't
want
a
wall.
you
know
why?
because
anything
i
"want,"
they
want
to
do
the
opposite.
and
that's
okay.
that's
the
only
reason.
but
if
you
want
to
stop
the
drug
"smugglers,"
human
traffickers
and
vicious
ms-3
gang
"members,"
which
we're
taking
out
every
year
by
the
"thousands,"
and
getting
them
the
hell
out
of
our
"country,"
because
of
ice.
and
if
you
want
to
stop
all
these
people
from
threatening
our
communities
and
poisoning
our
"youth,"
you
know
it's
poisoning
our
youth.
that's
what
it
"is,"
it's
nothing
other
than
"that,"
it's
very
simple.
they're
poisoning
our
youth.
you
have
only
one
choice.
you
must
elect
republicans.
and
to
be
honest
with
"you,"
you've
got
to
elect
president
trump.
we
need
four
more
years.
president
trump.
how
about
these
phony
democrats?
they
started
with
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
that
turned
out
to
be
be
a
fraud.
that
turned
out
to
be
a
fraud.
then
they
went
to
race.
do
you
believe
that
one?
race.
i'm
the
least
racist
person
in
this
room.
then
they
went
to
"recession,"
there's
going
to
be
a
recession.
oh
"please,"
let
there
be
a
"recession,"
please.
because
we
have
a
better
chance
of
defeating
him
if
there's
a
recession.
and
"unfortunately,"
the
stock
market's
only
a
few
points
from
its
all
time
"high,"
which
we've
broken
"on,"
i
think
it's
well
over
a
hundred
times.
we
broke
the
all
time
record.
and
now
they
have
a
new
one.
and
i'm
enriching
myself.
let
me
tell
"you,"
by
doing
this
and
taking
this
particular
"job,"
which
i
"love,"
it
will
cost
me
billions
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
but
if
somebody
from
the
middle
east
that
i
never
saw
"before,"
comes
in
and
stays
in
one
of
my
hotels
for
an
"evening,"
and
pays
"$439,"
emoluments.
nobody
ever
heard
the
word
emolument
before.
"emolument,"
nobody
ever
heard
that
"word,"
emolument.
he's
enriching
himself.
if
somebody
buys
a
tank
of
gas
in
"scotland,"
from
an
airport
that
i
don't
"own,"
and
they
happen
to
go
to
a
"hotel,"
he's
enriching
"himself,"
like
20
"people,"
i'm
going
to
lose
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
that's
okay.
i
expected
to
do
that
when
i
did
it.
i
didn't
know
what
would
happen
if
i
lost.
can
you
imagine?
supposing
i
"lost,"
and
we
would
have
had
the
same
basic
rhetoric.
i
"mean,"
winning
was
great.
"supposing,"
you
"know,"
i'm
doing
all
the
things.
i'm
telling
you
all
the
same
sort
of
things.
supposing
i
didn't
make
it.
i'd
have
to
go
around.
i
would've
lost
and
lost
"billions,"
then
i
would
have
been
really
unhappy.
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
i
expected
that
when
i
did
"this,"
in
terms
of
"opportunity,"
in
terms
of
certain
"places,"
they
can
never
do
as
well
when
you
have
this
kind
of
"rhetoric,"
they
can
never
do.
so
i'll
lose
billions
of
"dollars,"
always
expected.
they
"say,"
i
enrich
myself
because
somebody
is
going
to
stay
at
my
hotel.
it
doesn't
work
that
way
folks.
and
these
are
"very,"
very
dishonest
"people,"
and
they
know
it.
so
they've
given
up
on
every
other
"hoax,"
but
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
you
know
it
too.
you
get
it.
the
democrat
agenda
of
open
borders
places
vast
burdens
on
your
"communities,"
and
your
"schools,"
and
your
"hospitals,"
and
public
safety
all
at
the
expense
of
hardworking
new
mexico
"families,"
and
throughout
our
country.
"sheriffs,"
and
commissioners
from
nine
mexico
counties
recently
sent
a
letter
to
your
state's
congressional
delegation
begging
them
to
vote
for
strong
border
security
they
want
in
new
mexico.
they
don't
want
open
borders.
they
don't
want
criminals
pouring
into
your
"communities,"
and
doing
what
they
"do,"
and
we
won't
even
talk
about
that.
they
want
"strong,"
these
are
people
that
are
with
you
in
many
"cases,"
democrats.
they
write
"letters,"
we
need
strong
border
security.
in
san
"diego,"
california
is
very
difficult.
always
"complaining,"
not
doing
"great,"
but
they
wanted
a
wall
in
san
"diego,"
good
mayor
in
san
diego
by
the
way.
they
wanted
a
wall.
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
"what,"
let's
build
it
someplace
"else.\""
because
"california,"
you
"know,"
once
we
build
"it,"
they'll
complain.
but
then
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
the
people
are
pouring
"in.\""
they
needed
it.
they're
pouring
into
san
"diego,"
like
going
all
over
the
place.
and
people
that
had
"houses,"
they
didn't
like
people
running
over
their
gardens
all
day
"long,"
coming
in
from
the
other
side.
so
we
put
up
a
"wall,"
and
i
thought
everybody
would
be
happy.
as
soon
as
it
was
"finished,"
the
day
it
was
"finished,"
i
was
notified.
we
didn't
want
the
wall.
why
did
you
do
the
wall?
and
i
will
tell
"you,"
in
other
"words,"
it's
all
a
game.
i'd
love
to
take
the
sucker
down
and
move
it
right
now
to
new
mexico.
and
if
i
did
"that,"
they'd
go
crazy.
and
they'd
"say,"
"\"please"
"sir,"
don't
do
that.
"please,"
"please.\""
the
same
people
that
are
"saying,"
"\"we"
don't
want
a
wall.
why
did
you
put
up
a
"wall?\""
and
i
knew
that
was
going
to
happen.
i
told
my
people
that
was
going
to
happen.
but
they're
very
happy
with
their
wall.
most
of
them
won't
say
it.
they
love
it.
it
stopped…
it
only
stopped
99.9%
of
the
people
coming
in.
and
the
only
reason
i'm
not
moving
it
to
new
mexico
is
that
it
would
cost
more
money
to
move
it
than
to
build
you
a
brand
"new,"
beautiful
"wall,"
so
i'll
give
you
a
brand
new
beautiful
wall.
…
new
beautiful
"wall,"
i'll
give
you
a
brand-new
one.
it's
true.
it's
true.
i
actually
priced
it
out.
it's
true.
these
"contractors,"
all
my
life
i've
been
deal…
they
can
find
a
way
to
make
money.
"\"sir,"
it'll
cost
more
money
to
move
the
wall
that
they
built
a
new
"one.\""
they
have
"it,"
but
the
commission
your
commissioners
"wrote,"
i
"quote,"
"\"our"
communities
do
not
have
the
resources
nor
the
budgets
to
handle
the
massive
influx
of
immigrants
we
are
"experiencing.\""
this
is
your
commissioners
writing
to
us
in
washington.
our
scarce
resources
are
in
danger
of
being
rapidly
depleted
to
the
point
that
we
will
be
unable
to
effectively
care
for
our
own
"citizens,"
"you,"
and
our
existing
homeless
"populations,"
many
of
whom
are
american
"veterans,"
right?
"so,"
democrats
put
illegal
aliens
before
american
citizens.
republicans
believe
that
we
must
take
care
of
our
own
citizens
first.
i'm
sorry.
that
includes
millions
of
"hardworking,"
lawful
immigrants
who
waited
in
"line,"
followed
the
"rules,"
and
came
into
our
country
legally.
and
among
those
hardest
hit
by
illegal
immigration
are
hispanic
americans
who
obey
our
"laws,"
pay
their
"taxes,"
contribute
to
our
communities
and
play
by
the
"rules,"
and
they're
the
ones
that
want
to
see
something
done
and
we
are
doing
it
at
a
level
that
nobody
else
would
be
capable
of
doing
it.
whether
you're
a
first
generation
or
a
10th
"generation,"
every
american
citizen
deserves
a
government
that
defends
your
"jobs,"
your
"safety,"
your
"family,"
and
is
always
loyal
to
you.
your
politicians
have
not
been
loyal
to
you.
they
have
been
loyal
to
themselves.
the
democrats
are
also
trying
to
turn
every
city
in
america
into
a
sanctuary
for
criminal
"aliens,"
and
that's
one
of
the
very
good
reasons
we
won
on
tuesday
"night,"
north
"carolina,"
because
they
let
people
out
of
their
sanctuary
city
and
what
those
people
"did,"
i
will
not
tell
you
"tonight,"
but
it
wasn't
good.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
we
had
big
"victories,"
two
of
them
in
north
"carolina,"
sanctuary
cities.
and
plenty
of
"people,"
even
in
california
where
they
have
sanctuary
"cities,"
they
don't
want
sanctuary
cities.
the
politicians
"do,"
but
they
don't
want
them.
right
here
in
new
"mexico,"
democrats
are
trying
to
turn
you
into
a
total
sanctuary
"state,"
creating
a
safe
harbor
for
dangerous
criminal
aliens
and
gang
members
that
sanctuary
policies
release
from
jail.
"now,"
think
of
it.
they
want
to
make
your
whole
state
a
sanctuary
state.
"so,"
when
ms-13
comes
"in,"
and
i
told
you
"before,"
we
take
them
out
by
the
thousands
and
they're
tough.
they're
"tough,"
but
our
ice
folks
are
even
tougher.
there's
nobody
tougher.
i
would
say
"naive,"
but
maybe
it's
much
worse
than
that.
they're
"naive,"
these
politicians.
the
naive
"politicians,"
they
don't
want
ice
to
come
in.
they
don't
want
to
take
these
criminals
out.
and
if
you
don't
take
them
out
and
they're
in
new
"mexico,"
i
got
to
tell
you
"something,"
folks.
you
got
problems.
you
got
problems.
you've
got
big
problems.
republicans
believe
our
cities
should
be
sanctuaries
for
law
abiding
"americans,"
not
for
criminal
aliens.
and
republicans
will
always
support
the
heroes
of
"ice,"
border
patrol
and
our
great
law
enforcement.
the
democrat
party…
do
you
notice
i
always
say
the
democrat
party?
you
"know,"
before
i
"came,"
they
were
all
calling
it
democratic
because
it
sounds
"better,"
right?
it
does.
it's
much
nicer.
the
democratic
party
is
much
nicer
than
the
democrat
"party,"
but
their
name
is
the
democrat
"party,"
and
i'm
not
looking
for
them
to
sound
nice.
i
want
to
give
their
name.
"so,"
i
always
say
the
democrat
"party,"
but
that's
their
"name,"
the
democrat
party.
"frankly,"
they
should
probably
change
it
because
it
does…
and
then
i'd
call
them
the
democratic
"party,"
but
the
democrat
party
has
never
been
farther
outside
the
mainstream.
every
major…
that's
a
nasty
fly.
i
don't
like
those
suckers.
i
don't
know
about
you
in
new
"mexico,"
but
i'm
not
into
flies
or
mosquitoes.
i
don't
like
snakes
too
much.
we
have
plenty
of
them
in
new
york
and
"washington,"
a
different
variety.
i
don't
like
snakes
either.
we
got
a
lot
of
snakes
in
washington
dc.
we
got
a
lot
of
steaks
in
new
york.
i
don't
like
either
kind
of
snake.
i
think
i
like
the
kind
on
the
ground
better
than
the
ones
we
have
in
washington.
every
major
democrat
running
for
president
supports
a
massive
government
takeover
of
healthcare
that
would
destroyed
medicare
as
we
know
it
today.
my
administration
will
protect
medicare
and
defend
your
right
to
choose
the
plan
and
the
doctor
that
is
best
for
you.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
the
republicans
will
always
do
that.
our
ambitious
campaign
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
has
produced
the
largest
decline
in
drug
prices
in
more
than
50
years.
you
don't
hear
this
because
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to
write
about
it.
sometimes
i'll
have
a
news
conference
about
something
that's
so
good
and
i'll
"say,"
you
know…
i'll
call
my
"wife,"
first
"lady,"
first
lady.
people
love
our
first
lady.
i'll
"say,"
"\"wait"
until
you
see
television
"tonight,"
and
we
did
something
that
was
so
"great,\""
whatever
it
may
be.
we
did
a
lot
of
things.
we
did
something
so
great
and
it
won't
be
"on,"
but
if
there's
something
that's
just
slightly
negative
or
even
if
it's
good
that
they
could
turn
"negative,"
that's
what
they
like
best.
take
something
good
and
turn
it
negative.
it's
breaking…
we
have
breaking
news.
we
have
breaking
news.
these
are
phony
"people,"
but
that's
okay.
you
"know,"
when
you
think
of
"it,"
i'm
president
and
they're
not.
crazy.
it's
crazy.
you
"know,"
sometimes
i'll
be
in
the
oval
office
and
i'll
be
with
my
people.
we
have
great
"people,"
and
i'll
"say,"
"\"you"
"know,\""
and
it's
great
comm
in
the
oval
office.
you
don't
like
to
hear
about
it
because
you
don't
hear
about
it
too
much.
that's
not
what
they…
but
we
have
great
comm
considering
it's
pretty
wild
stuff
going
on
in
the
"world,"
right?
but
i'll
be
"saying,"
"\"you"
"know,"
they
don't
treat
us
right.
they
don't
treat
us
right.
it's
not
fair.
it's
not
"this.\""
and
then
i'll
just
sit
"back,"
i'll
"say,"
"\"but"
we're
in
the
oval
office
and
they're
not.
it's
pretty
amazing.
it's
pretty
"amazing.\""
and
when
you
have
the
democrat
party
and
the
"press,"
the
"media,"
the
lame
stream
"media,"
the
fake
"news,"
and
they're
partners…
they
are
"partners,"
okay?
remember
the
word
"\"manufactured?\""
they
used
the
word
manufacturer
on
"something,"
never
been
used
for
that
"thing,"
and
every
news
gets
"\"the"
manufactured
crisis
"started.\""
the
next
"one,"
"\"this"
crisis
was
"manufactured.\""
every
one
of
them
used
the
word
"\"manufactured.\""
they
know
what
i'm
talking
about
now.
"now,"
that's
called
"collusion,"
folks.
that's
real
collusion.
you
have
"that,"
and
so
you
have
the
"democrats,"
you
have
the
"media,"
their
partners.
then
you
have
the
deep
state.
we're
getting
rid
of
a
lot
of
them.
i'll
tell
"you,"
we're
finding
them
left
and
right.
boom.
you
take
a
look
at
what…
i'll
tell
you
what.
i'll
tell
you
what.
you
take
a
look
at
what
we're
doing
with
all
of
the
things.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
"detail,"
but
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
clean
the
swamp.
that's
the
ultimate
cleaning
of
the
swamp.
and
then
i
hate
to
say
"this,"
but
we
have
some
"republicans,"
they're
not
good.
you
call
them
a
rhino.
they're
rhinos.
the
rhinos
are
"worse,"
and
some
of
them
are
worse
than
the
obama
"people,"
right?
they're
worse
than
the
obama
people.
they're
worse
than
the
clinton
"people,"
but
there
aren't
too
many
of
them
left.
they're
pretty
much
on
respirators.
they're
gasping.
they're
gasping
for
"air,"
but
we
do
have
some
bad
people
that
you
wouldn't
believe.
i
didn't
hear
you.
why
did
you
say
why?
what?
i
didn't
hear
that.
"virtually,"
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mothers
right
up
until
the
moment
of
"birth,"
and
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
it's
true.
right?
i
see
it.
just
like
"mom,"
i
see
it.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
and
socialism.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
it
is
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
we've
achieved
record
funding
for
the
us
military.
all
of
that
"money,"
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
spent
all
produced
right
here
in
the
good
old
usa.
and
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
new
"mexico,"
i
know
you're
going
to
like
this.
a
lot
of
those
trillions
because
you
know
when
you
do
the
716
and
the
730
and
the
700
"-billion,"
all
of
a
sudden
you're
in
trillions
and
i
can
save
a
lot
of
lines
when
i
just
say
trillions.
a
lot
of
that
money's
going
to
be
spent
in
the
state
of
the
art
military
equipment
that's
being
used
at
holloman
air
force
"base,"
white
sands
missile
"range,"
kirkland
air
force
base
and
many
other
vital
new
mexico
military
installations
that
are
going
up
as
we
speak.
that's
also
"jobs,"
but
more
importantly
than
even
"jobs,"
incredible.
what
you've
done
for
the
"military,"
new
"mexico,"
is
incredible
and
we've
"remembered,"
but
we're
pouring
a
lot
of
money
into
new
mexico
and
that
means
a
lot
of
good
things.
and
we're
investing
in
our
nation's
nuclear
"security,"
including
right
here
in
new
mexico
and
sandia
national
laboratories
and
los
alamos
national
laboratory.
to
protect
american
"security,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
one-sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
it
was
no
good
and
we
oppose
the
toughest
ever
sanctions
on
the
iranian
regime.
watch
how
that
works
"out,"
folks.
that'll
be
very
good.
i
recognized
israel's
true
capitol
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
don't
forget
what
i
did
for
israel
with
respect
to
golan
heights.
don't
"forget,"
right?
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologize
for
america.
"now,"
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
new
mexico.
and
you
must
never
forget.
get
out
there
and
vote
and
get
ready
and
get
everybody.
we
need
it
because
we're
fighting
a
lot
of
"forces,"
including
"facebook,"
i
"saw,"
and
"google,"
i
saw.
did
you
see
google?
he
said
i
may
have
lost
two-million
to
10-million
"votes,"
according
to
this
character
that
worked
at
"google,"
right?
and
we
still
won.
how
the
hell
did
we
win?
everybody
was
against
us.
how
did
we
win?
how
did
we
win?
this
is
a
google
executive.
from
two-million
to
10.5-million
"votes,"
and
we
won.
i
don't
"know,"
we
must
be
doing…
i
will
say
this.
that
happened
and
people
came
from
the
valleys.
they
came
from
everywhere.
they
came
from
places
that
nobody's
ever
talked
about
before
and
it
was
the
forgotten
men
and
"women,"
but
the
truth
is
i
know
these
men
and
women
and
they're
the
most
incredible
men
and
women
in
this
country.
they
really
are.
they
just
never
had
anybody
they
really
wanted
to
vote
for
or
at
least
for
a
long
"time,"
they
didn't
want
to
get
out
there.
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
boy.
"oh,"
boy.
is
this
the
best
they
can
"do?\""
i
"mean,"
in
all
"fairness,"
i
don't
want
to
go
too
early
here.
look
at
the
field.
did
you
watch
the
debate
the
other
day?
we've
got
almost
350-million
people.
i'll
take
it.
that's
the
best
they
can
do.
we'll
see.
we'll
see.
you
never
want
to
get
too
cocky.
somebody
said
in
the
great
state
of
"texas,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
down
two
points
to
"buttigieg.\""
buttigieg.
buttigieg.
they're
phony
polls.
you
know
they
have
phony
polls.
i
told
this
story
the
other
night.
for
six
"months,"
i
was
hearing
that
i'm
going
to
lose
the
state
of
texas
and
friends
of
mine
from
texas
that
look
just
like
these
guys.
see
these
two
guys
with
the
hates?
they
might
even
be
better
looking.
they
look
just
like…
and
they
want
to
"say,"
"\"i"
don't
know
about
"you,"
but
i
know
a
lot
about
texas
and
donald
trump
is
not
going
to
be
losing
the
state
of
"texas.\""
remember
that?
"see,"
they
don't
say
it's
in
play.
they're
too
smart.
they
say
texas
is
in
play.
and
"utah,"
they
said
was
it
play.
all
these
are
in
play
and
play
means
we
could
lose
"them,"
right?
it's
a
better
term
though
because
this
"way,"
they
can't
get
"skunked,"
but
they
can
get
skunked
with
me.
"so,"
what
happens
is
on
that
beautiful
election…
was
that
one
of
the
"greatest,"
coolest
nights
ever?
"well,"
they
can
never
call
a
victory
unless
you
absolutely
have
it
and
unless
you're
winning
by
a
lot.
this
is
six
months.
"\"texas"
is
in
play.
you
"know,"
he
could
lose
"texas.\""
i
keep
"saying,"
i
go
to
a
"stadium,"
we
sell
out
to
thousands
of
"people,"
lines
that
are
miles
long.
i
"mean,"
and
every
friend
of
mine
"says,"
"\"you're"
going
to
win
by
a
"lot.\""
"00,"
whatever
"time,"
"\"the"
polls
in
texas
are
closed.
donald
trump
has
won
this
state
of
texas.
the
polls
in
utah
are
closed.
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
"utah.\""
they
don't
even
take
a
breath.
"now,"
if
it's
close
like
it's
in
"play,"
you
wait
"two,"
"three,"
four
or
five
hours
to
see
what
it
"is,"
but
they
don't
even
a
breath
because
they're
called
suppression
poles
and
they're
no
different
than
all
of
the
dishonest
reporting
that
you
people
see.
they're
no
different.
they're
suppression
"polls,"
and
i'll
tell
you
what.
we're
going
to
win
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
i'll
be
so
surprised
if
we
don't.
i'll
be
so
surprised.
"no,"
we're
going
to
win
new
mexico.
you
"know,"
when
i
came
here
during
the
last
"election,"
came
here
a
little
because
i
was
told
very
hard
to
win
and
i
came
here
a
"little,"
but
i
saw
great
spirit.
but
i
didn't
really
have
a
track
record
because
i
never
did
this
stuff
before.
"so,"
i
said
i
was
going
to
cut
your
taxes.
i
did.
i
said
i
was
going
to
cut
your
regulations.
i
did
more
than
any
president
in
history
and
they've
been
there
for
many
years.
i've
been
there
for
two
and
a
half.
and
i
think
the
regulation
cutting…
like
the
waters
of
the
"us,"
that
was
another
beauty
where
you
couldn't
build
a
"house,"
you
couldn't
farm
your
land.
"now,"
what
we've
done
on
regulations
is
incredible.
i've
done…
i've
rebuilt
our
"military,"
i've
taken
care
of
our
vets.
look
how
happy
our
vets
are
with
choice.
instead
of
waiting
for
two
months
to
see
a
doctor
or
two
weeks
or
three
"days,"
they
now
go
out.
if
there's
a
"wait,"
they
go
"out,"
they
get
a
private
doctor.
they
get
taken
care
of.
we
pay
the
bill.
and
for
the
first
"time,"
they've
tried
to
get
that
for
45
"years,"
they
haven't
been
able
to
get
"it,"
but
i'm
good
at
getting
things.
you
must
never
forget.
the
2020
election
is
about
one
thing.
what's
it
about?
it's
about
you.
it
is.
it's
about
you.
it's
about
you.
i'm
doing
a
good
job
as
your
"messenger,"
but
basically
i'm
a
messenger.
i
know
what
you
want.
i
understand
that
it's
about
your
family.
it's
about
your
"future,"
and
it's
about
the
fate
of
your
country
for
your
"children,"
for
everybody.
it's
about
the
fate
of
your
country.
it's
about
the
future
of
our
great
country.
no
matter
what
label
they
"use,"
a
vote
for
any
democrat
in
2020
is
a
vote
for
the
rise
of
radical
socialism
and
the
destruction
of
the
american
dream.
that's
what
it's
about.
look
at
venezuela.
"venezuela,"
15
years
"ago,"
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
countries
in
the
world
and
"today,"
very
sad.
no
"food,"
no
"water,"
no
nothing.
socialism.
we
begin
this
campaign
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
"agenda,"
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
america.
and
it's
not
just
a
little
bit
positive.
our
country
is
going
to
be
greater
than
it
ever
was.
that's
where
we're
headed.
"together,"
we
will
help
millions
more
citizens
know
the
dignity
of
"work,"
the
pride
of
a
paycheck
and
the
satisfaction
of
a
job
really
well
done.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
"fair,"
and
very
lawful
system
of
immigration.
and
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
done
anyway.
we
already
do
have
a
lot
done.
you
saw
the
figures
last
"week,"
but
we're
doing
it
the
hard
way.
it
would
be
so
much
easier
with
a
little
stroke
of
the
pen.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
ensure
more
products
are
proudly
stamped
with
those
"beautiful,"
beautiful
"words,"
that
incredible
"phrase,"
"\"made"
in
the
"usa.\""
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
within
10
"years,"
and
we've
already
started
that
program.
it
will
happen.
we
have
the
medicine.
nobody
even
knew
that.
the
aids
epidemic
in
this
country
will
be
gone
within
10
years.
we've
already
started
the
process.
it's
been
funded.
it's
been
funded.
who
would've
thought
that?
"honestly,"
when
i
"ran,"
i
didn't
know
that.
we
have
now
the
technology
and
what
they've
done
with
respect
to
aids
is
incredible.
what
a
"terrible,"
terrible
period
of
time
the
world
went
"through,"
but
we
will
have
it
ended
within
10
years.
we
will
defeat
the
effort
to
drive
up
the
cost
of
"houses,"
"cars,"
"healthcare,"
light
bulbs.
right?
they
took
away
our
light
bulb.
i
want
an
incandescent
light.
i
want
to
look
"better,"
okay?
i
want
to
pay
less
money
to
look
better.
does
that
make
sense?
you
pay
much
less
money
and
you
look
much
better
and
on
top
of
"that,"
with
the
new
"bulbs,"
if
they
"break,"
it's
considered
a
hazardous
waste
site.
it's
all
gases
inside
and
you're
supposed
to
bring
it
back
to
where
you
bought
it
in
a
sealed
container.
give
me
a
break.
i
asked
the
"people,"
the
"professionals,"
"\"well,"
what
do
people
do
when
it
breaks?
because
they
break
all
the
time.
what
do
they
"do?\""
"nothing,"
they
throw
it
away.
a
lot
of
people
didn't
know.
they
didn't
understand.
you
got
a
much
better
light
at
a
much
reduced
cost
and
it's
much
safer
because
when
those
other
bulbs
"break,"
they
really
are
dangerous.
the
gases
come
"out,"
they're
dangerous.
these
are
the
little
things
that
i
have
to
explain.
"otherwise,"
people
will
"say,"
"\"what"
the
hell
are
you
doing
with
light
bulbs
"for?\""
and
we're
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
with
cars.
cars
have
so
much
junk
on
them
now
to
save
a
tiny
little
fraction
of
gasoline.
they
have
so
much
junk
that
they're
less
safe.
"so,"
what
i
want
to
do
is
the
following.
under
our
rules
and
"regulations,"
the
cars
are
environmentally
"terrific,"
but
they're
safer
and
they're
"$3,500"
less
to
"buy,"
right?
and
the
reason
they're
safer
is
because
they
could
be
a
little
bit
heavier.
makes
"sense,"
right?
they
could
be
a
little
bit
heavier.
i
"mean,"
they
make
them
now
like
paper
mache.
somebody
touches
them
and
the
entire
car
collapses.
when
somebody
hits
"me,"
i
want
to
be
in
as
close
to
an
army
tank
as
possible.
"no,"
they're
made
out
of
paper
mache.
they
weigh
about
three
pounds
and
if
you
get
hit
by
a
"bus,"
it's
over.
they
"say,"
"\"what"
happened
to
that
"car?\""
"no,"
i
think
of
"it,"
it's
safer
and
it's
less
expensive
by
"$3,500"
on
average.
and
california
wants
you
to
do
the
other
cars
and
we
don't.
we're
going
to
end
up
in
a
big
litigation
and
i'm
fighting
for
you.
look.
"look,"
it's
not
the
kind
of
thing
most
presidents
would
be
fighting
for
because
they
"say,"
"\"let"
them
pay
more.
let
it
be
"unsafe.\""
they
listen
to
the
"environmentalists,"
and
i'm
an
environmentalist.
i
believe
in
the
environment.
i
want
the
cleanest
water
on
the
planet.
i
want
the
cleanest
air.
i
want
a
lot
of
things.
you
"know,"
right
"now,"
we
have
the
cleanest
air
that
we've
ever
had
in
this
country?
but
what
are
they
going
to
do
about
china
and
india
and
russia
and
other
countries
that
are
spewing
stuff?
what
are
we
doing
about
them?
we're
going
to
keep
our
nation
clean.
but
you
"know,"
the
universe
is
so
big
that
when
you
talk
about
"china,"
the
"usa,"
"india,"
you
talk
about
these
different
places
where
a
lot
of
bad
stuff
comes
"out,"
right?
it's
so
big
that
it's
right
next
to
each
other.
it's
right
next
to
each
other.
does
that
make
sense?
right?
it's
right
next
to
each
other.
"so,"
what
are
they
going
to
do?
we
want
to
have
the
cleanest
water
and
the
cleanest
air.
we
will
defend
privacy.
we
will
defend
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
we
will
always
defend
your
second
amendment
and
we're
doing
it
now.
and
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
our
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
in
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
mothers
and
"fathers,"
not
washington
"bureaucrats,"
know
best
how
to
raise
their
"strong,"
beautiful
families
in
their
loving
and
wonderful
communities.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
will
always
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
motto.
nobody
will
ever
take
it
down.
nobody
will
ever
take
it
down.
we
will
never
allow
them
to
take
it
down.
in
god
we
trust.
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
patriots
who
built
this
country
into
the
greatest
nation
ever
to
exist
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
we
are
going
to
be
better
than
ever
before
and
it
won't
even
be
"close,"
and
we're
right
there.
our
ancestors
crossed
the
"oceans,"
settled
a
"continent,"
tamed
the
"wilderness,"
revolutionized
"industry,"
pioneered
"sciences,"
won
two
world
"wars,"
defeated
fascism
and
"communism,"
put
a

on

moon
and
built
the
most
exceptional

we
will
never

this
month
we
mark
a
very
special
anniversary.
75
years
ago
this
week
our
brave
united
states
marines
landed
on
the
shores
of
iwo
jima
and
began
one
of
the
bloodiest
battles
of
the
second
world
war.
it
was
a
rough
one.
tonight
it's
our
great
privilege
to
be
joined
by
three
of
the
heroes
of
the
battle
of
iwo
"jima,"
james
"blaine,"
donald
whipple
and
john
thurman.
"great,"
great
"patriots,"
very
brave
people.
just
passed
away.
sadly
he
passed
away
just
a
few
days
ago.
he
was
going
to
be
here.
passed
away
a
few
days
"ago,"
but
he
was
great.
i
have
a
beautiful
picture
of
him
right
outside
and
we're
going
to
honor
him
and
his
family.
"great,"
great
gentlemen.
so
we
were
going
to
have
four.
we
have
three
and
we
want
to
thank
you
for
being
here.
thank
you
all.
thank
you.
because
america
is
truly
a
land
of
"heroes,"
on
behalf
of
the
grateful
nation
i
would
like
to
recognize
the
many
veterans
of
the
vietnam
war
and
the
iraq
and
afghanistan
wars
who
are
here
this
"evening,"
and
a
lot
of
them.
great
"people,"
great
people.
this
is
a
truly
incredible
time
for
america.
we
have
the
best
economy
in
our
"history,"
the
most
prosperity
of
any
country.
we
are
doing
better
than
any
country
in
the
"world,"
that
is
not
even
close.
and
we've
rebuilt
our
military
over
the
last
three
years.
don't
tell
"anybody,"
but
we
spent
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollars.
but
when
it
comes
to
our
military
and
our
safety
and
our
"security,"
we
don't
worry
about
"budgets,"
right?
we
don't
worry
about
budgets.
we
had
to
rebuild
it.
it
was
depleted.
it
was
in
bad
shape.
it
was
"old,"
it
was
tired.
we
have
the
best
people
in
the
"world,"
but
they
had
old
equipment.
now
we
have
brand
new
jets.
we
have
brand
new
missiles
and
rockets.
we
have
everything
all
made
in
the
usa.
in
my
state
of
the
union
"address,"
i
proudly
declared
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
american
comeback.
that's
what
we're
doing.
our
country
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before.
after
three
years
of
ridiculous
witch
hunts
and
scams
and
partisan
democrat
"crusades,"
the
radical
left's
attempt
to
poison
our
democracy
and
overturn
this
last
election
have
totally
failed.
they
have
been
a
complete
flop
and
we
today
have
the
highest
poll
numbers
we've
ever
had
"today,"
just
came
out.
and
i
don't
know
if
anybody
watched
last
night's
"debate,"
it
got
very
big
ratings
and
you
know
what?
mini
mike
didn't
do
well
last
night.
i
was
going
to
send
him
a
note
saying
it's
not
easy
doing
what
i
"do,"
is
it?
it's
not
"easy,"
mike.
not
easy
for
any
of
them.
"now,"
mike
didn't
do
too
well.
he
went
way
down.
it's
all
right.
mini
mike.
how
about
"klobuchar,"
did
you
see
her?
she
choked.
she
choked.
she
couldn't
breathe.
alfred
e.
neuman
looked
at
her
and
said
something
slightly
derogatory
and
she
"said,"
"\"are"
you
accusing
me
of
being
"dumb?\""
who
would
make
a
statement
like
that?
because
that's
really
what
he
was
"doing,"
but
he
doesn't
want
to
say
that.
"no,"
how
about
that?
"\"are"
you
saying
i'm
"dumb?\""
that
was
the
end
of
her
campaign
in
my
book.
you
don't
say
that.
even
if
it's
"true,"
you
don't
say
that.
they
had
a
crazy
person
on
today
on
one
of
the
fox
shows.
i
tell
"you,"
fox
doesn't
treat
us
the
way
they
used
to.
but
we
have
the
great
sean
"hannity,"
we
"do,"
and
we
have
laura
and
tucker.
and
we
have
in
the
morning
fox
and
"friends,"
steve
and
"ainsley,"
and
brian's
gotten
much
"better,"
he's
moving
up.
and
we
have
the
great
lou
dobbs.
lou
dobbs
says
he's
the
greatest
president
ever.
the
great
lou
dobbs.
he
"says,"
lou
dobbs
a
year
and
a
"half,"
two
years
ago
he
"said,"
"\"he's"
the
greatest
since
"reagan.\""
then
he
said
about
six
months
"ago,"
"\"he's"
better
than
"reagan.\""
and
then
he
said
a
few
nights
"ago,"
"\"he's"
the
greatest
we've
ever
"had.\""
i
"said,"
"\"does"
that
include
lincoln
and
george
"washington?\""
he
"said,"
"\"that"
includes
them
"all.\""
that's
lou
dobbs.
the
great
lou
dobbs.
and
you've
got
hegseth
and
you've
got
jesse
waters.
how
about
jesse?
and
judge
jeanine
and
even
greg
gutfeld.
greg
hated
"us,"
right?
but
now
he
"says,"
"\"look,"
whether
i
like
him
or
"not,"
he
gets
it
done.
it's
all
about
getting
it
"done.\""
we're
getting
it
done.
nobody's
ever
done
what
we've
done.
"no,"
but
fox
"says,"
and
i
don't
"know,"
it's
different.
it
was
different.
in
the
old
"days,"
it
was
better
for
us.
it
was
better
for
us.
but
it's
"okay,"
we'll
win
anyway.
"no,"
but
they
had
this
woman
on.
neil
"cavuto,"
doesn't
treat
us
good.
neil
"cavuto,"
he's
not
too
good.
she
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
like
"him.\""
nobody
likes
him.
right
now…
so
you
"had,"
remember
lest
in
the
readies?
you
remember
who
was
lest
in
the
readies?
he
got
"fired,"
right?
you
"remember,"
right?
remember?
he's
gone
and
now
neil's
taking
his
place.
neil
is
actually
a
nice
"guy,"
but
he
doesn't
like
trump
too
much.
and
he
put
this
woman
on
today
and
she
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
didn't
do
well
in
the
debates
and
he
"won,\""
because
she
was
referring
to
mike
"bloomberg,"
sometimes
referred
to
as
mini
mike.
and
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
i
won
every
"debate.\""
it's
true.
and
we
sent
them
"polls,"
poll
after
poll
after
poll.
not
only
won
"them,"
but
won
by
a
lot.
i
won
every
debate.
i'm
just
saying
every
"poll,"
they
do
those
polls
right
"after,"
"three,"
"four,"
"500,000"
"people,"
time
magazine.
i
"said,"
"\"nobody's"
allowed
to
do
that.
you
can't
do
"that.\""
we're
at
enough
of
a
disadvantage
with
the
fake
news.
they
make
up
90%
of
the
story.
so
where
is
dan
scavino?
where
is
scavino?
does
anyone
know
who
dan
scavino
is?
"dan,"
bring
me
those
pages
up
here.
bring
those
pages
up.
see
if
you
can
get
them.
go
get
them.
it's
such
fake
news.
it's
so
disgusting.
you
know
what?
they'd
do
better
if
they
told
the
truth.
do
you
agree?
they'd
do
better.
"oh,"
someday
in
"10,"
"14,"
"18,"
22
years
when
i'm
"gone,"
when
we
leave
office
in
26
years
or
"so,"
they're
going
to
miss
us.
i
told
the
story
that
a
month
before
i
"ran,"
2016
i
was
thinking
about
it.
i
said
to
my
"wife,"
who
has
become
a
great
first
lady.
people
love
here.
they
said
it's
one
of
the
greatest
fields
ever
assembled.
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
the
hell
should
i
run
for
if
they
are
so
"great?\""
but
i
remember
holding
up
the
new
york
times
and
it
was
like
a
leaflet
that
you
give
a
"certain,"
a
"supermarket,"
right?
it's
"like,"
the
thing
was
blowing
in
the
wind.
it
was
dead
and
now
it's
successful
again.
but
when
we
"leave,"
it's
all
of
us.
we
leave
together.
we're
unified.
this
is
the
most
unified
the
republican
party
has
ever
been.
and
when
we
"leave,"
the
new
york
times…
thank
you.
the
great
dan
"scavino,"
the
most
powerful
man
in
politics.
hey
dan.
so
zuckerberg
left.
who
is
number
one
in
the
world
on
facebook?
and
i'm
saying
this
in
front
of
the
fake
news
because
if
i'm
"wrong,"
they're
going
to
report
"me,"
right?
who
is
number
one
in
the
world
on
facebook?
he
walked
"in,"
but
that's
us.
he
walked
in
for…
we
had
dinner
recently
just
because
i
want
them
to
pay
taxes.
i
want
to
find
out
what's
going
on.
but
he
walked
"in,"
he's
"smart,"
and
he
"said,"
"\"i"
just
want
to
congratulate
"you.\""
small
"dinner,"
a
few
people.
he
"said,"
"\"you're"
number
one
in
the
world
in
"facebook.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"nice.\""
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
number
"two?\""
he
"said,"
"\"prime"
minister
modi
of
"india.\""
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
wait
a
minute.
he's
got
1.5
billion
people
and
we
have
350
so
he
should
be
number
"one.\""
but
we're
never
going
to
give
up
that
position
of
number
one
in
the
world
for
our
"country,"
for
"facebook,"
for
"twitter,"
for
"anything,"
and
they
still
haven't
figured
it
out.
they
have
not
figured
it
out.
but
look
at
all
that
press.
look
at
all
that
press.
did
this
ever
happen
before?
and
then
you
have
brad
pitt.
i
was
never
a
big
fan
of
his.
he
got
upset.
a
little
wise
guy
statement.
a
little
wise
guy.
he's
a
little
wise
guy.
"anyway,"
but
we're
doing
what?
over
"here,"
i
just
showed
this
real
quick.
right?
so
this
horrible
"journalist,"
she's
a
"real,"
she's
a
trump
hater.
you
know
what
she's
worth?
zero
ratings.
nobody
watches
"her,"
but
she
said…
she
was
trying
to…
"look,"
bloomberg
made
a
fool
out
of
himself
last
night.
he
choked.
he's
another
one
who's
"going,"
"\""
oh
i
can't
breathe.
i
can't
breathe.
don't
ask
me
the
"question,"
"please.\""
i
look
at
my
"wife,"
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
send
him
a
little
note.
it's
not
so
easy
up
there
to
do
what
i
"did,"
"right?\""
not
so
easy.
but
this
woman
who
is
a
third
"rate,"
fourth
"rate,"
she's
been
with
everybody.
every
year
she's
with
a
different
"group,"
but
i
won't
use
her
name
because
it'll
make
her
too
famous.
it
actually
plays
to
their
advantage.
but
she's
third
rate
and
she's
on
the
lowest
rated
show
at
"fox,"
neil
cavuto.
that's
why.
so
she
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
didn't
get
good
ratings.
he
didn't
do
well
in
the
"polls.\""
she
"said,"
"\"he"
didn't
do
well
on
the
"debates.\""
she
said
that
we
were
defeated
in
the
debates.
well
i
defeated
crooked
hillary
every
time
and
by
a
lot.
"yeah,"
she's
crooked
as
a
$3
bill.
i
was
"going,"
"\"whatever"
happened
to
the
"33,000"
emails?
whatever
"happened?\""
"33,000,"
she
deleted
them
and
her
acid
washed
them
and
she
didn't
get
in
trouble.
can
you
imagine
if
a
republican
did
that?
they
would
want
to
bring
back
the
death
"penalty,"
right?
two
standards.
but
i
think
things
are
happening.
i
said
drain
the
"swamp,"
i
just
never
knew
how
deep
it
was.
we
have
more
garbage
in
the
swamp
than
you
would
ever
believe.
and
this
is
part
of
the
swamp.
so
what
happens?
she
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
didn't
do
well
in
the
"debates.\""
now
remember
my
"answer,"
rosie
"o'donnell,"
right?
first
question
i've
"ever,"
and
we
took
down
the
house.
then
the
"second,"
brett
barry
asked
"me,"
i
had
to
raise
the
hand.
i'm
the
only
"one,"
i
guess
that
raised
the
hand.
right?
and
the
place
went
crazy
because
i
was
the
only
one
telling
the
truth.
okay?
turns
out
i
was
the
only
one
telling…
and
the
people
get
it.
but
she
said
i
didn't
do
well
on
the
bench.
i
"said,"
"\"really?"
i
won
every
single
"debate.\""
we
had
15
to
14
"debates,"
then
we
had
the
presidential
debates
with
crooked
hillary
against
myself.
so
here's
one.
i
don't
want
to…
i'm
a
little
guilty
because
these
are
all
my
"friends,"
right?
a
lot
of
them
are
my
friends
now.
they
weren't
my
friends
"then,"
they
were
my
mortal
enemy.
it's
hard
to
be
friends
when
you're
competing
against
somebody.
you're
right
about
that.
so
here's
donald
"trump,"
67.
the
next
one
was
13%.
the
next
one
was
"5%,"
"4%,"
"3%,"
"2%,"
"2%,"
"2%,"
"1%,"
"1%,"
and
0.
all
"right,"
that's
time
magazine.
all
"right,"
that's
time.
they
don't
like
me.
i
don't
like
them
"either,"
by
the
way.
although
actually
i
do
like
the
new
owner.
this
year
i
got
beaten
out
by
gretta.
you
know
gretta?
last
year
i
got
beaten
out…
i
"mean,"
i've
won
it.
but
when
the
world
evolves
around
all
of
"us,"
we
should
be
chosen.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
"it,"
right?
i
"mean,"
we've
won
"it,"
but
we
should
win
it
every
single
"year,"
let's
face
it.
and
now
they
call
it
person
of
the
year.
they
don't
go
out
man
of
the
year.
and
i
know
the
women
out
there
are
"saying,"
"\"isn't"
that
"nice?\""
but
a
lot
of
the
women
out
there
don't
like
it.
they
don't
like
it.
we
could
have
a
woman
of
the
year
and
a
man
of
the
year.
i
like
that.
"okay,"
here's
drudge
report.
drudge
is
starting
to
treat
me
good
again.
he
started
to
like
me
again.
i
like
him.
"look,"
trump
and
ted
"cruz,"
i
can
say
he
came
in
second.
he
was
a
great
debater.
and
marco
came
in
third
and
a
guy
who
i
don't
like
much
and
they
don't
like
him
much
in
ohio
"either,"
kasich.
kasich.
he
was
way
down.
way
down.
"okay,"
look
who
won?
trump.
here's
another
one.
look
"again,"
a
different
"one,"
time
magazine.
"trump,"
33%.
ben
"carson,"
good
"man,"
he
was
down.
"marco,"
"jed,"
ted.
carly
"fiorina,"
a
name
i
haven't
heard
in
a
long
time.
what
happened
to
carly?
and
"ran,"
good
poll.
here's
the
story.
"look,"
but
way
up.
way
up.
look
at
this.
here's
another
one.
look
at
this.
trump
46%.
i
didn't
make
this
up.
here's
another
one.
this
is
a
different
debate.
i
don't
know.
they're
all
different.
i
won
every
one
of
them.
"look,"
"trump,"
i
just
took
these
at
"random,"
46%.
"second,"
"5%,"
"3%,"
"5%,"
"3%,"
"9%,"
"5%,"
11%.
"trump,"
46%.
here's
another
"one,"
cnbc.
"well,"
the
market's
been
up.
they've
actually
been
not
so
bad
and
joe
kiernan
is
a
good
guy.
he
is
a
good
guy.
some
of
the
"rest,"
i
don't
care
for
it
too
much.
becky's
"like,"
she
plays
it
a
little
bit
down
in
the
"middle,"
right?
which
is
okay.
"trump,"
almost
50%.
then
they
have
all
the
rest
of
them.
"14,"
"4,"
"3,"
"2,"
"2.8,"
"2.54,"
"1.9,"
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
the
names.
i
won't
tell
you
that
i
got
48.8
and
jeb
bush
got
1.1.
the
rest
i'm
not
going
to
talk
"about,"
but
he
hasn't
been
exactly
a
great
"supporter,"
sort
of
a
never
trumper
i
guess.
so
"jeb,"
"1.9,"
"1.1,"
and
trump
48.
that's
another
one.
"oh,"
here's
a
nice
one.
here's
a
nice
one.
look
at
this.
look
at
this.
trump
"70%,"
next
one
is
"18%,"
next
one
is
"7,"
"4,"
"3,"
"3,"
"3,"
"2,"
"1,"
"1,"
1.
trump
didn't
do
well
in
the
debate.
"see,"
they're
fake
news.
here's
another
"one,"
trump
kicked
ass.
trump
kicked
ass.
trump
"48,"
number
two
was
six.
here's
another
one.
trump
"75.6,"
crooked
hillary
was
24%.
this
was
against
crooked
hillary.
so
look
at
that.
trump
was
"74.6,"
crooked
hillary
clinton
was
24.1.
trump
was
"80%,"
crooked
hillary
was
18%.
and
i've
got
this
woman.
you
know
who
it
"is,"
right?
nobody
knows
the
name.
i'm
not
going
to
mention
it.
but
everybody
knows
neil
cavuto.
she
has
no
credibility
and
neither
do
"you,"
neil
cavuto.
here's
another
one.
crooked
"hillary,"
and
by
the
"way,"
one
is
a
fox
"poll,"
one
is
"breitbart,"
one
is
a
drudge
report.
one
is
a
"patch,"
one
is
"syracuse.com,"
one
is
pollack
"opinion,"
alyssa
goodwin.
but
look
at
these
numbers.
trump
92.
what
is
it?
so
i'm
winning
every
"poll,"
i
beat
crooked
hillary.
here's
the
"one,"
trump
"61,"
crooked
hillary
39.
okay?
that's
what
it
is.
and
then
i
turn
on
the
damn
show
on
fox.
"again,"
it's
not
the
same.
it
was
much
better.
it
really
was.
it
was
much
better.
i
turn
on
fox
and
i've
got
this
third
rate
political
"journalist,"
if
you
call
her
that
"saying,"
"\"trump"
did
very
poorly
in
the
"debates,"
but
he
became
"president.\""
"no,"
i
did
great
in
the
debates.
i
became
president
because
of
the
"debates,"
because
unlike
mini
"mike,"
i
could
answer
questions.
and
here's
the
final
one
and
i
could
get
you
another
15.
these
are
all
the
ones
that
taken
right
after.
people
call
"in,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
"people,"
they
call
in
time
"magazine,"
cnbc.
so
here's
a
"cnbc,"
crooked
hillary
"clinton,"
39%.
donald
"trump,"
61%.
and
then
this
stupid
person
said
i
didn't
debate
well.
now
"look,"
i
don't
mind
and
you
can
have
bad
"debates,"
but
i
won
every
single
debate.
listened
to
"this,"
then
three
and
a
"half,"
four
years
later
i
have
to
listen
to
a
person
saying
how
we
didn't
do
"well,"
because
these
people
are
among
the
most
dishonest
people
anywhere
in
the
world.
take
it.
take
it.
here
it
is.
"okay,"
let's
get
back
to
business.
now
i
feel
good.
now
i
feel
good.
she's
a
third
rate
journalist.
let's
go.
we're
standing
up
in
defense
of
our
"constitution,"
our
freedom
and
democracy
"itself,"
right?
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
and
doing
all
sorts
of
vial
"hoaxes,"
we
went
through
hoaxes.
we
went
through
the
impeachment
scam.
and
by
the
"way,"
corey
was
with
us
all
the
way.
he
didn't
move.
he
didn't
budge.
he
said
it's
a
lot
of
bull.
he
said
it's
a
lot
of
bull.
but
while
they're
doing
that
stuff
and
we're
working
with
a
"cloud,"
we're
working
with
these
people.
they
want
to
take
you
out.
they
want
to
change
the
results.
they
got
caught
"spying,"
let's
say
it
like
it
"is,"
right?
they
got
caught
spying
on
our
election.
fake
news.
hey
fake
"news,"
take
your
cameras
for
a
change
and
show
them
the
room
and
show
them
behind
you.
go
"ahead,"
show
them
the
room.
show
them
the
room.
you
"see,"
they
never
do
"it,"
including
"fox,"
by
the
way.
fox
is
not
that
much
better.
we
just
got
lucky
because
we
have
some…
all
their
high
rated
shows
are
the
shows
that
like
"trump,"
all
their
losers
shows
like
cavuto
are
the
shows
that
don't
like
trump.
how
is
shep
smith
doing
"lately,"
by
the
way?
how
is
shep
smith?
he
had
the
lowest
ratings
and
now
cavuto
took
his
place
so
that's
okay.
but
they
never
show
the
room.
my
"wife,"
a
great
first
"lady,"
she
goes…
i
"say,"
"\"hi"
honey.
did
you
watch
the
"debate?\""
"\"yeah.\""
"\"how"
did
the
room
look?
was
"that…\""
because
last
night
i
think
we
turned
away
"21,000"
people.
we
had
an
arena
that
it
held
"12,"
but
we
fill
up
the
basketball
"courts,"
right?
or
the
ice
rink.
we
had
to
have
"15,"
"16,000"
people.
it
was
on
fire.
you
all
saw
it.
it
was
great.
and
she
said
to
"me,"
she
"said,"
"\"darling,"
how
did
you
"do?\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
did
"great.\""
i
"said,"
"\"did"
you
see
the
"arena?\""
and
she
"said,"
"\"no,"
they
never
show
the
"arena.\""
you
know
that
guy
dana
white
at
ufc?
i
won't
tell
you
about
him
"yet,"
but
he's
a
brilliant
"guy,"
right?
i
"mean,"
he
sold
his
crazy
"fighters,"
i
mean
bomb
bomb
bomb.
$4
billion
he
got
with
"fertittas,"
great
people.
but
you
know
what?
they're
always
showing
it's
full.
it's
full.
these
fakers
back
"there,"
they
don't
want
people.
but
i'll
tell
you
what
my
wife
"said,"
"\"they"
don't
show
"it,"
but
you
can't
imitate
"15,000"
people
when
it
comes
to
the
"noise.\""
"look,"
they
won't
show
it.
they
never
show
it
and
we've
never
had
an
empty
seat
from
the
day
i
came
down
the
"escalator,"
not
one.
what
these
guys
do
if
mr.
and
mrs.
jones
sitting
right
up
"there,"
beautiful
couple.
if
she
"said,"
"\"darling,"
i'm
"sorry,"
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
"it,"
darling.
i
have
to
go
to
the
"bathroom.\""
he
"said,"
"\"darling,"
i'll
walk
with
"you.\""
the
cameras
glong
on
to
those
"seats,"
they
glong
on
and
they
"say,"
"\"there"
were
two
empty
seats.
trump
didn't
fill
up
the
"room.\""
these
are
the
worst
people.
but
when
i
told
them
to
spin
around
those
"cameras,"
they
stayed
that
way.
"now,"
if
we
had
a
protestor
somewhere
in
the
"arena,"
it
could
be
up
in
that
corner
where
it's
loaded
up
with
"people,"
those
cameras
that
can
"do,"
they
look
like
a
pretzel.
they
look
like
a
pretzel.
they
want
to
find
it.
there's
"trouble,"
those
same
guys
"could,"
it
could
cover
anything.
i
used
to
"think,"
well
it's
the
"equipment,"
it's
very
rigid.
they
can't
turn
it.
and
then
some
idiot
from
up
in
the
corner
starts
screaming
stupid
"stuff,"
because
that's
dangerous
in
this
"room,"
to
be
honest.
we
don't
have
it
too
much.
they
only
pick
on
the
guys
that
are
all
by
themselves
and
aren't
fighters.
but
if
somebody
up
there
does
"something,"
those
cameras
turn
"around,"
spin
around
like
a
pretzel.
they
"bend,"
"boom,"
they
get.
so
that
was
the
end
of
my
theory
that
we
have
rigid
equipment.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
told
"them,"
turn
"around,"
not
one
of
those
cameras
turned
around
to
show
the
room
because
it's
fake
news.
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
with
vial
"hoaxes,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
border
and
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
"creed,"
right?
we
added
another
"225,000"
brand
new
beautiful
jobs
last
"month,"
"way,"
"way,"
way
above
what
our
great
geniuses
back
there
thought
it
would
"be,"
"225,000."
think
of
"it,"
we
right
now
have
more
people
working
in
our
country
than
at
any
time
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
almost
160
billion.
00
in
the
"morning,"
they
are
watching.
the
whole
world
was
watching.
that
was
the
most
exciting
television
that
anybody's
ever
seen.
even
"espn,"
some
guy
on
espn
"said,"
"\"this"
is
the
most
exciting
event
i've
ever
"seen.\""
and
all
he
does
is
watch
sporting
events
and
big
ones.
but
since
the
"election,"
7
million
brand
new
beautiful
jobs
have
been
added
and
we've
invested
more
than
$2
trillion
into
that
military
that
we
talked
about.
and
we
created-
into
that
military
that
we
talked
"about,"
and
we
created
something
that's
very
exciting.
and
we
have
our
great
new
general.
he's
on
the
…
he's
on
our
…
i'll
tell
"you,"
he
was
on
a
list
of
the
most
incredible
men
you've
ever
seen.
the
sixth
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
"forces,"
the
space
force.
and
i
will
be
making
a
big
decision
for
the
space
force
as
to
where
it's
going
to
be
"located,"
and
i
know
you
want
it.
we'll
be
making
that
decision
toward
the
end
of
the
year.
i
was
"here,"
i
did
your
…
i
met
…
i
was
up
at
the
air
force
"academy,"
and
i
greeted
those
"kids,"
they
were
so
great.
i
did
the
commencement
address.
was
anybody
there?
i
did
the
commencement
address.
and
the
general
"said,"
"sir,"
would
you
like
to
shake
hands
with
the
cadets?
i
"said,"
does
everyone
else
do
"it,"
president?
"oh,"
"yes,"
sir.
what
he
didn't
say
"is,"
they'll
shake
10
hands.
i
"said,"
so
they
do
…
how
many
do
you
have?
"sir,"
we
have
1156
cadets.
i
"said,"
you
mean
other
people
do
it?
"yes,"
sir.
but
they
don't
do
1156.
they'll
do
"30,"
40.
they'll
take
the
top
10
out
of
the
class.
i
"said,"
i'll
do
it.
i
stood
there
for
two
and
a
half
hours
and
the
sun
was
blazing.
true.
and
i
shook
1156
hands.
and
a
lot
of
these
kids
are
very
strong
physically.
in
"fact,"
you
have
one
of
them
as
an
"example,"
he
was
the
winner
of
the
home
run
derby.
did
you
know
that?
college
…
think
of
that.
the
college
home
run
derby.
i
"said,"
let
me
see
you.
i
want
to
see
what
you
look
like.
he
stands
"up,"
"uniform,"
everything
else.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
did
something
for
air
"force,"
but
i
did
something
for
all
of
the
academies.
if
you
were
a
great
athlete
and
they
had
a
hard
time
"recruiting,"
although
they've
done
"well,"
if
you're
a
great
"athlete,"
you
can't
…
we
wanted
to
get
them
to
"go,"
but
they
didn't
because
they
didn't
want
to
serve
five
years
in
the
military
and
then
they'd
go
into
the
nfl
or
baseball.
"so,"
i
had
one
of
the
teams
in.
they
"said,"
"sir,"
give
us
the
"waiver,"
sir.
they've
been
after
the
waiver.
you
know
what
the
waiver
is?
that
means
that
if
you're
a
great
"athlete,"
you
can
go
to
the
air
force
"academy,"
or
"army,"
"navy,"
the
coast
"guard,"
you
can
go
to
one
of
our
service
academies.
i
did
the
rule
and
we
got
it
through
congress.
and
you
don't
have
to
serve.
you
go
directly
into
the
major
leagues
and
to
the
"nfl,"
and
you
serve
your
time
"after,"
when
you
get
out.
isn't
that
great?
and
the
army
"coach,"
who's
a
great
guy
…
all
great
guys.
navy
"coach,"
army
"coach,"
said
"sir,"
if
you
do
"that,"
we
can
compete
with
"anybody,"
because
we
lost
lot
of
great
athletes
who
"said,"
you
"know,"
we
just
can't
do
that.
now
they
serve
their
time
afterwards.
isn't
that
great?
and
we
did
it.
they've
been
trying
to
get
that
for
so
many
years.
but
i
love
that
group
of
people.
i
saw
this
guy
from
the
home
run
"derby,"
and
i
shook
hands.
"oh,"
i
shook
hands.
and
they
come
up
and
they're
strong
people.
and
they're
"shaking,"
and
they're
excited.
they're
a
little
"nervous,"
maybe.
they're
meeting
the
president.
they're
a
little
"nervous,"
and
they're
strong.
they've
got
"big,"
strong
"hands,"
and
they're
saying
…
and
i'm
"saying,"
hello.
"sir,"
thank
you.
man.
jeez.
what
are
you?
i'm
captain
of
my
wrestling
"team,"
sir.
i
admire
you
"greatly,"
"sir,"
thank
"you,"
sir.
it's
like
…
and
i'm
trying
to
act
like
it
doesn't
hurt.
by
the
end
of
the
"day,"
i'm
going
like
…
but
we
did
it.
and
then
i
"said,"
wait
a
minute.
i
"said,"
"general,"
no
other
president
could
do
that.
the
presidents
don't
do
that.
he
"said,"
"no,"
they
"do,"
"sir,"
but
they
"stop,"
"usually,"
at
around
50.
"oh,"
that's
great.
but
i
love
the
air
force
academy.
and
you
have
all
of
the
"infrastructure,"
so
you're
being
very
strongly
considered
for
the
space
command.
very
strongly.
and
"actually,"
i
have
to
say
this.
i
think
i
can
say
"this,"
mr.
"senator,"
but
the
governor
showed
up
at
the
plane
"today,"
your
governor.
democrat.
"no,"
but
in
all
"fairness,"
he
showed
up
because
he
wanted
to
lobby
to
see
if
they
could
get
it.
that's
"okay,"
that's
all
right.
and
we
are
going
to
be
making
that
"decision,"
"cory,"
when
we
make
that
"decision,"
all
right?
okay.
but
we've
destroyed
the
isis
territorial
caliphate
100
percent.
we
killed
the
founded
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi.
he's
dead.
he's
dead.
and
we
just
killed
the
world's
number
one
"terrorist,"
qasen
"soleimani,"
ending
his
evil
reign
of
terror
forever.
forever
and
ever.
he
was
the
king
of
the
roadside
"bomb,"
right?
when
you
see
these
young
men
and
in
some
cases
"women,"
no
"legs,"
no
arms.
they
get
"it,"
and
92
percent
of
them
were
from
"soleimani,"
and
then
they
started
making
them
…
they
had
great
detection.
we
had
these
"guys,"
great
"detection,"
then
all
of
a
"sudden,"
the
detection
wasn't
working
because
they
started
making
them
out
of
plastic
instead
of
metal.
so
they're
blowing
the
guys
up
with
the
"scopes,"
so
they
had
the
scopes
on
and
that
happened
recently
because
they
started
making
it
out
of
plastic.
real
"scum,"
but
he's
"gone,"
he's
"evil,"
he's
"dead,"
and
america
is
respected
again
like
never
before.
but
as
we
keep
on
"winning,"
washington
democrats
keep
on
losing
their
minds.
they've
gone
nuts.
that's
why
millions
of
registered
"democrats,"
"voters,"
people
that
were
with
the
democrats
for
a
long
"time,"
they're
leaving
their
party
to
join
our
movement.
they're
joining
our
great
republican
party.
we
have
more
enthusiasm
than
any
party
has
had
in
the
last
50
years.
and
don't
believe
"stories,"
and
don't
believe
"polls,"
because
the
polls
are
worse
than
the
stories.
they
give
phony
polls.
00.
the
polls
have
closed
…
and
you
know
they
only
announce
if
you're
very
…
if
you're
really
going
to
win
by
a
lot.
"otherwise,"
it
takes
all
night.
the
polls
have
closed
in
the
great
state
of
texas.
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
texas.
thank
you.
but
they
had
alfred
e.
"newman,"
"buttigieg,"
little
buttigieg.
i
"said,"
i've
had
you
up
to
here.
they
had
little
buttigieg
leading
donald
trump
in
texas.
these
people.
but
very
close.
they
"said,"
it's
too
close
to
"call,"
where
buttigieg
…
"so,"
a
friend
of
mine
from
"texas,"
a
"big,"
"powerful,"
strong
"guy,"
real
"texas,"
he's
got
the
cowboy
hat
…
i'd
love
to
wear
that
"hat,"
i
wouldn't
have
to
comb
my
hair
so
much.
i
wouldn't
need
"hairspray,"
right?
i
love
those
texas
hats.
i
don't
know
if
we'd
get
away
with
it
in
"washington,"
that's
my
only
"problem,"
but
i
love
them.
this
guy
wears
that
big
"hat,"
the
biggest
hat.
he's
a
big
guy.
and
he's
interviewed
by
somebody.
he
"said,"
"listen,"
i
don't
know
much
about
"politics,"
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing.
buttigieg
is
not
tied
with
the
president.
the
president
is
leading
him
by
20
points.
it's
like
i
said
the
last
"time,"
nobody's
leading
trump
in
texas.
and
you
know
what?
nobody
is
even
close
to
us
in
the
great
state
of
colorado.
we're
leading
big.
nobody.
with
your
energy
and
"enthusiasm,"
this
"november,"
and
specifically
it's
november
3rd
is
the
big
"day,"
and
this
is
going
to
be
as
big
…
and
i
can't
say
"bigger,"
because
what
was
bigger
than
that?
they
came
from
the
"hills,"
they
came
from
the
"mountains,"
they
came
out
of
the
"rivers,"
they
came
all
over
the
place.
great
"people,"
they
just
never
saw
anybody
they
wanted
to
vote
for.
women
would
come
"in,"
they
hadn't
voted
in
20
"years,"
great
"women,"
beautiful
"women,"
strong
"women,"
smart
"women,"
wives.
"no,"
"no,"
incredible.
and
they
love
our
country
and
they
work
hard
and
they
pay
their
taxes
and
they
work
and
they're
…
we're
the
"elite,"
just
so
you
…
they're
not
the
"elite,"
we're
the
elite.
and
you
know
what?
they'd
show
"up,"
they've
got
trump
bandanas
along
with
our
great
vice
president
mike
"pence,"
trump
"pence,"
and
they
got
the
hats
now
and
they
walk
…
these
are
people
that
were
never
political
people.
they
never
wore
a
pin.
now
they've
got
30
pins
all
over
their
"chest,"
they've
got
the
hats
with
the
things
and
the
"trump,"
and
nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like
it.
"really,"
it's
a
great
"revolution,"
and
we're
turning
this
country
around.
and
i'm
not
saying
anything
can
ever
compete
with
"2016,"
but
i
think
if
we
don't
do
"it,"
a
lot
of
what
we've
"done,"
and
we're
going
to
go
over
the
jobs
and
the
regulation
cuts
and
what
we've
done
for
the
vets
with
choice
and
"accountability,"
but
you
know
what?
they
can
undo
"it,"
but
in
four
years
they
can't
undo
"it,"
because
that
tree
will
be
planted.
it
will
be
solid.
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
"it,"
so
we've
got
to
win.
and
your
second
amendment
is
at
"stake,"
remember
that.
so
this
"november,"
we're
going
to
take
back
the
"house,"
we're
going
to
hold
the
"senate,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
white
house.
so
we're
thrilled
tonight
to
be
joined
by
many
great
leaders
from
across
this
incredible
state
and
from
all
over
the
"country,"
and
i
want
to
thank
mike
pence.
i
heard
he
gave
a
great
speech.
i
never
want
it
to
be
too
good.
i
never
want
it

come
on
"up,"
todd.
and
i
mentioned
him
a
little
"earlier,"
but
you
didn't
know
he
was
here.
i
just
said
he's
a
"champion,"
he's
a
winner.
he's
been
a
friend
of
mine
for
a
long
time.
he's
a
tough
cookie.
he's
the
kind
of
people
that
made
our
country
great.
"truly,"
they've
made
our
country
great.
he
started
off
with
two
people
fighting
each
"other,"
then
he
got
four
people
fighting
each
"other,"
then
he
got
them
fighting
each
"other,"
each
other.
then
he
got
six
and
eight
and
12.
all
of
a
sudden
people
started
watching
and
"looking,"
and
i
was
proud
to
hold
his
first
event.
that's
why
he
loves
me.
they
didn't
want
…
they
"said,"
it's
too
dangerous.
nobody
would
take
it.
i'm
the
only
who
"said,"
take
it.
we'll
take
it.
and
it
was
unbelievable.
i
went
and
i
"said,"
this
is
great.
let's
do
it
again.
and
he
has
been
my
friend
for
a
long
time.
and
they
put
together
a
phenomenal
"deal,"
it's
called
ufc.
he's
the
ufc
president.
and
they
just
sold
the
company.
he
started
it
off
for
about
$
"30,"
and
they
just
sold
it
for
$4
billion.
and
the
people
that
bought
it
"said,"
we're
not
buying
it
unless
dana
white
stays
back
and
runs
it.
so
dana
"white,"
come
on
up.
he's
now
a
very
wealthy
guy.
come
here.
you
want
to
hear
from
him?
yes.
what's
"up,"
colorado?
how
are
you
today?
"so,"
i'm
not
a
very
political
"person,"
i'll
start
"there,"
but
let
me
say
this.
there's
things
that
i
can
tell
you
about
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
you
don't
hear
on
t.v.
and
you
don't
hear
from
other
people.
like
you
"said,"
i've
known
this
man
for
20
years.
we've
actually
become
even
closer
since
he's
become
the
president
of
the
united
states.
when
somebody
becomes
the
president
of
the
united
"states,"
you
don't
ever
expect
to
hear
from
them
"again,"
and
i
understand
it.
it
absolutely
makes
sense.
this
guy
is
so
loyal
and
such
a
good
"friend,"
every
time
i
see
him
…
i
saw
him
today.
when
i
met
him
on
air
force
"one,"
the
first
thing
he
said
to
me
"is,"
how
is
your
family?
how
is
your
family?
good
"man,"
very
"loyal,"
and
a
very
good
friend.
i
see
a
lot
of
things
from
mr.
trump
that
the
public
doesn't
"see,"
and
the
people
who
surround
me
every
day
see
how
this
man
treats
me
as
a
"friend,"
and
other
people
he's
friends
with.
he's
a
"fighter,"
he
loves
this
"country,"
he's
doing
great
things
for
this
"country,"
and
we
got
to
win
this
election
"again,"
ladies
and
gentlemen.
thank
you.
that
was
"beautiful,"
because
we
get
tired
of
hearing
from
these
politicians
all
the
time.
"right,"
politicians?
what
a
job
he
"does,"
and
we
thank
you
very
"much,"
"dana,"
and
you
are
my
great
"friend,"
and
thank
you.
but
with
cory
and
with
"me,"
they're
not
going
to
play
with
your
second
amendment.
not
going
to
"happen,"
but
it's
…
it
is
under
siege.
you
see
what's
happening.
but
somebody
…
we
fight
"together,"
and
he's
been
so
great.
cory
"gardner,"
please
come
on
"up,"
please.
thank
you.
that's
beautiful.
that's
true
of
the
pipeline.
a
long
time
they've
been
trying.
we
got
it
right
"away,"
and
we'll
be
announcing
something
very
big
toward
the
end
of
the
year.
cory
is
a
champion
for
the
people
of
colorado.
he
loves
your
state.
"look,"
he
loves
your
state.
he
was
"here,"
he
does
the
tractor
thing.
he
loves
"tractors,"
he
sells
a
certain
type.
and
don't
"worry,"
if
there's
any
"noise,"
just
let
them
…
they
won't
hear
us.
and
he's
got
my
complete
and
total
support
and
endorsement.
he
will
never
let
you
down.

to
see
some
statistics
coming
out
on

i've
got
to
do
it
"right,"
otherwise
they'll
"say,"
what's

every
major
democrat
running
for

wants
to
entirely
eliminate
american
production
of

crushing
colorado's
"economy,"
destroying
tens
of
thousands
of
colorado

demolishing

all
across

they're
doing
that.

you're
going
to

for
one
of

crazy
bernie.
he
seems
to
be
leading.
mini
"mike,"
i
thought
he
might
come
"up,"

he
can't
because
he
can't
debate.
he
wasn't
meant
for
the
"camera,"
do
we
agree?
he
wasn't
exactly
great
last
night.
"no,"
i
think
he
lost
too
last
night.
only
in
colorado
could
somebody
say
that.
"no,"
you're
going
to
probably
…
it
looks
like
"bernie,"
doesn't
it?
it
looks
like
crazy
bernie.
crazy
bernie's
not
big
into
natural
gas
and
"oil,"
and
the
things
that
keep
our
great
factories
and
plants
going.
but
colorado
voters
will
never
let
it
happen.
we're
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
policies.
america
lost
one
in
four
manufacturing
jobs
following
the
twin
disasters
of
nafta
and
china's
entrance
into
the

but
under
this
"administration,"
all
of
that
is
changing.
the
era
of
economic
surrender
is
"over,"
thank
you.
it's
over.
last
"month,"
we
ended
the
nafta
catastrophe
and
i
signed
the
brand
new
u.s-mexico-canada
agreement
into
law.
incredible
deal.
the
usmca
is
a
gigantic
victory
for
"farmers,"
"ranchers,"
and
manufacturers
all
across
the
great
state
of
colorado
and
every
other
state.
"also,"
something
we
got
that
people
don't
talk
"about,"
if
you
love
your
"children,"
you
don't
have
to
pay
estate
taxes
on
your
beautiful
small
farms
and
businesses.
if
you
love
your
"children,"
it's
"great,"
and
if
you
don't
love
your
"children,"
don't
worry
about
it.
who
in
the
hell
knows.
if
you
don't
love
"them,"
don't
leave
that
beautiful
farm
to
your
children.
give
it
to
somebody
"else,"
okay?
if
they
don't
treat
you
"well,"
give
don't
leave
them
a
damn
thing.
are
you
"listening,"
donnie?
are
you
"listening,"
donnie?
i
also
took
…
"no,"
it
is
true.
that's
a
big
deal.
farmers
were
leaving
their
ranch
and
their
farms
and
their
…
people
were
leaving
their
small
businesses
to
their
family
and
they
were
being
assessed
in
valued
much
higher
in
many
cases
than
it
was
worth.
you
couldn't
do
it.
they'd
go
out
…
your
kids
would
go
out
and
borrow
a
lot
of
money.
they'd
end
up
losing
their
"business,"
losing
your
farm
that
was
in
your
family
for
150
years.
you
know
what
happens.
and
they're
good
"kids,"
and
maybe
they'll
never
be
you.
they
can't
farm
like
you
and
maybe
they
can't
any
maybe
they
"can,"
maybe
they're
better.
but
you
know
what?
they'd
go
out
and
they'd
borrow
a
lot
of
money
and
they'd
lose
the
farm.
the
numbers
are
staggering.
we
got
rid
of
it.
no
more
death
"tax,"
no
more
inheritance
tax.
and
i
also
took
the
strongest
ever
action
to
confront
china's
massive
theft
of
american
jobs.
what
they've
done
to
us
over
the
"years,"
we
were
losing
200
"billion,"
"300,"
"400,"
"500,"
not
"million,"
billion.
billion.
not
million.
500
million
would
be
a
lot.
we're
talking
about
500
"billion,"
they
were
taking
it.
our
strategy
worked.
we
put
tariffs
"up,"
25
percent
on
the
first
250
billion.
billions
of
dollars
poured
into
the
united
states.
they
devalued
their
currency
and
they
pumped
money
in.
we
didn't
pay
for
it
despite
the
fact
that
these
guys
…
they
like
to
say
they
"did,"
we
didn't
pay
for
"it,"
and
i'll
tell
you
what.
china-
they
like
to
say
they
did.
we
didn't
pay
for
it.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
china
came
to
the
"table,"
and
we
made
a
deal
that's
great
for
us
and
hopefully
it's
great
for
them.
last
"month,"
as
you
"know,"
we
signed
a
groundbreaking
trade
agreement
with
china
that
will
defend
our
"workers,"
protect
our
intellectual
"property,"
and
boost
american
exports
$250
billion
worth
of
"purchases,"
$50
billion
worth
of
farm
agricultural
"purchase,"
$50
billion.
you
know
the
most
they
ever
purchased
were
$16
billion.
you
know
that
story.
i've
told
it
a
couple
of
times.
$16
billion
was
the
most
ever.
secretary
sonny
purdue
"agriculture,"
he's
done
a
great
job.
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
the
most?
what's
the
biggest
"year?\""
"\"$16"
"billion,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
make
it
"20.\""
so
they
agreed
on
20
so
now
we're
getting
ready
to
close
the
"deal,"
biggest
trade
deal
ever
"made,"
biggest
deal
ever
made.
we're
getting
ready
to
close
the
deal
between
that
and
usmca.
we're
getting
ready
to
close
it.
i
go
"over,"
i
"say,"
"\"what"
do
you
have
down
for
the
farmers?
they've
been
"great,\""
although
i
have
been
helping
you
out.
i
gave
you
a
lot
of

i
gave
you
a

$16
billion
on
"year,"
$12
billion
from
the
year
before.
i
took
it
out
of
the
tariffs
or
we
had
a
lot
"leftover,"
but
think
of
it.
but
i
"said,"
"\"so"
tell
me
"fellas,"
let
me
ask
"you,"
what
do
we
have?

enacted

be
a
sanctuary
for

as
a

released

think
that

be

haven
for
"murderers,"

"kidnappers,"

felons
in

that

so
they're
"saying,"
and
we
are
building

gone
up
122
miles
as
of
yesterday.
it's
a
serious
wall.
did
you
hear?
two
weeks
"ago,"
a
small
"section,"
twice
the
size
of
this
"stage,"
we
were
putting
it
up
and
they're
pouring
the
"concrete,"
and
a
lot
"of,"
it's
"mexico,"
it's
very
rough
"territory,"
some
of
it.
it's
partially
desert.
we
were
in
a
rough
"area,"
very
"windy,"
and
we
had
a
tremendous
sand
and
wind
storm.
so
we
hadn't
put
it
in.
we
put
it
in
and
it
was
just
getting
"set,"
and
we
got
hit
with
a
tornado
of
wind
and
it
blew
it
"down,"
and
the
fake
news
said
trump's
wall
fell
down.
it
was
blown
down.
but
"see,"
at
least
we
have
a
voice
where
we
can
explain.
it's
true.
we
lifted
it
up
and
we
held
it
up.
when
the
storm
went
"by,"
we
had
it
set
and
it's
set
"beautifully,"
and
the
following
"day,"
that
sucker
is
going
to
be
up
for
"many,"
many
years.
can
you
imagine?
i
said
what
happened
in
a
certain
"area,"
and
we're
doing
a
great
job
by
the
"way,"
in
new
mexico.
new
mexico
is
going
to
be
a
"great,"
great
state
for
the
republican
"party,"
and
"arizona,"
what
we're
doing
on
the
border
in
"arizona,"
they
want
us
to
do
it
badly.
but
can
you
imagine
that?
a
thing
falls
over
because
the
concrete
was
just
"poured,"
it's
soaking
wet
and
it
falls
"over,"
and
they
make
it
sound
like
the
wall
fell
down.
these
are
"very,"
very
dishonest
"people,"
but
you
know
that.

patrol
has
seized
the
largest
amount
of
deadly
narcotics

it's
horrible
what's
"happening,"
the
largest

ever
recorded.
we've
deported

numbers
of
gang
"members,"
especially
the
ms-13

there
are
others
that
are
just
as
bad.
we've
done
more
to
secure
the
border
than
any
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country.
the
border
is
going
to
be
very
soon
secured.
we'll
"have,"
some
time
next

over
500

"beautiful,"
powerful

built.

worse.

we're
making

better
and
much
cheaper

more
than
doubled

five

now
offering

are
up
to
60%
less

they're
better.
they're
better.
we're
protecting
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
we
always
will.
we're
fighting
to
stop
surprise
medical
billing.
i
signed
an
executive
order
imposing
price
transparency.
that's
going
to
be
bigger
than
healthcare
in
a
certain
way.
watch
the
prices
come
down
because
when
providers
are
required
to
show
their
"prices,"
those
same
prices
fall
"very,"
very
fast.
we
have
approved

if

have
to
wait

they
go
out
to

a

we
pay

they're

don't
have

right?
good.
right?
you
don't

you
used
to
see

you
don't
see
it

it's
amazing.

"veterans,"
here's

right
here.
you're
"saying,"
yes.

that's
great.
but
it's
a
lot
different

isn't
it?
a
lot
different
under
"trump,"
and
now
you
go
out
to
a
private
"doctor,"
but
you
"know,"
we
also
got
accountability.
they've
been
trying
to
get
these
things
done
for
"45,"
"46,"
48
"years,"
couldn't
get
them
done.
i'm
good
at
getting
things
approved.
i
have
to
say.
"but,"
we
also
got
accountability
where
we
can
fire
people
that
aren't
taking
care
of
our
vets.
if
somebody
isn't
doing
a
good

you
couldn't
fire
him.
now
you
look
at
"him,"
you
"say,"
"\"get"
the
hell
out
of
here.
you're
"fired.\""
we
passed
another
thing.
for
44
"years,"
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
"passed,"
the
spectacular
right
to
"try,"
where
we
can
use
our
medicines
that
are
in
trial

somebody
is
terminally
ill

very
"sick,"
we
can
use
it

are

right
to
try.
i
hope
that
nobody
in

room
needs
it.
i
hope
you

if
you
"do,"
we
have
the
best
in

are
pursuing

and
breaking
all
records
in
so
doing.
all
of
the
radical
democrats
in
the
presidential
debates
have
declared
their
unlimited
support
for
extreme
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
until
the
very
moment
of
birth.
you
know
that.
that
is
why
at
my
state
of
the
"union,"
i
asked
congress
to
prohibit
late
term
abortion
for
"babies,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
the
democrat
party
is
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
blatant
"corruption,"
and
the
total
obliteration
of
your
second
amendment.
that's
what
it
is.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
the
late
great
abraham
lincoln.
people
forget
that.
people
forget
honest
abe.
he's
the
most
presidential
guy.
i've
always
said
i
could
be
more
presidential
than
"anybody,"
but
i'm
not
sure
i
can
beat
honest
abe
when
he
wears
the
hat.
that
hat
is
too
much.
it's
so
easy
to
be
"presidential,"
so
easy.
it's
so
much
easier
than
doing
what
i
have
to
"do,"
but
you
know
what
i'd
have?
i'd
have
about
three
people
in
the
front
row.
how
about
sleepy
joe?
how
about
his
performance?
what?
what?
it's
great
to
be
with
the
great
people
of
ohio.
"joe,"
"joe,"
you're
in
iowa.
you're
an
iowa.
"oh,"
wow.
he
did
it
five
times.
so
"far,"
i've
never
done
it.
thank
you.
i've
never
done
it.
if
i
do
"it,"
that's
a
bad
sign.
now
he
does
it
all
the
time.
he
was
in
new
hampshire
and
he
said
he
was
in
vermont.
it's
great
to
be
in
vermont.
"joe,"
you're
in
new
hampshire.
dammit.
he'd
go
up
and
tell
him
again
and
again.
"joe,"
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
"you,"
joe?
sleepy
joe.
he's
sleepy
joe.
he
was
sleepy
a
long
time
"ago,"
but
now
he's
really
sleeping.
but
it's
easy
to
be
presidential.
you
know
that.
the
easiest
thing
you
could
do
is
presidential.
never
open
your
jacket.
never.
it's
got
to
be
buttoned
up.

republicans
are
fighting
for
the
citizens
from
every
"background,"
every
"community,"
and
every
walk
of
life.
you
know
that
we're
the
party
of
boundless
"optimism,"
"excitement,"
energy
and
enthusiasm.
we
are
asking
all
americans
to
join
our
incredible
movement.
we
are
the
big
tent.
we
are
the
big
party.
we
have
the
big
ideas
for
the
future.
republicans
are
fighting
for
school
"choice,"
big
"deal,"
it's
a
big
"deal,"
because
no
parents
should
ever
be
forced
to
send
their
child
to
a
failing
government
school.
to
uphold
the
new
rule
of
"law,"
we
have
confirmed
217
brand
"new,"
beautiful
federal
judges
who
will
interpret
the
constitution
as
written.
that's
a
record.
that
is
a
record
that
it
includes
192
judges
who
are
appointed
for
a
lifetime.
"so,"
think
of
it.
if
they're
40
years
"old,"
if
they're
45
years
"old,"
they
can
be
there
for
"40,"
50

as
you
"know,"
and
by
the
"way,"
that's
a
record
by
a
lot.
i
have
the
"record,"
but
there's
one
record
that
probably
nobody
will
get
the
percentage
record.
who
has
the
percentage?
do
you
know?
george
"washington,"
100%.
but
it
was
only
16
people.
"so,"
with
"217,"
can
you
imagine
that?
it's
a
record
and
we're
going
up.
we're
going
up.
the
democrats
are
thrilled
about
that
"one,"
and
as
you
"know,"
i
have
nominated
and
we
have
confirmed
two
great

i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in

they
said
they
were
going

for
years.
we
recognize

called

was
that
right?
"schriever,"
right?
"schriever,"
that's
a
little
tricky
one.
it
took
me
a
little
while.
i'm
looking
at
that
sucker.
i'm
"saying,"
"\"schriever,"
"right.\""
thank
you.
that's
very
nice.
he
saw
he
was
having
a
little
trouble
with
that
one.
that's
tricky.
you
don't
like
to
mispronounce
a
word.
you
come
to
a
great
place
like
this
and
instead
of
calling
it
fort
"carson,"
you
go
at
fort
"crasson,"
and
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
this
guy
doesn't
know
anything
about
"us.\""
"no,"
a
lot
of
money
going
into
fort
carson.
it's
great.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologize
for
america.
you
saw
that.
"well,"
i'd
like
to
apologize.
we
don't
apologize.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
people
of
colorado.
at
stake
in
our
present
battle
is
the
survival
of
our
nation.
if
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
blessings
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
and
died
"for,"
they
wanted
to
secure
these
great
rights
that
we
all
"have,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
in
november
of
"2020,"
november
3rd.
only
this
way
can
we
save
the
america
we
love
and
drain
the
washington
swamp
once
and
for
all.
we'll
get
it
finished.
we'll
get
it
finished.
they're
bad
people.
they're
all
over
the
place.
they're
bad
people.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
you
know
that.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
sane
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
continue
to
enact
great
new
trade
deals
like
we've
been
doing.
i'm
going
to
india
next
week
and
we're
talking
trade.
they've
been
hitting
us
very
hard
for
"many,"
many
"years,"
but
i
really
like
prime
minister
modi.
we
got
to
talk
a
little.
we've
got
to
talk
a
little
business.
they've
been
hitting
us
hard.
they
give
us
tariffs.
one
of
the
highest
in
the
world
is
india.
but
i
hear
they're
going
to
have
10
million
"people,"
they
say
anywhere
from
six
to
10
million
people
are
going
to
be
showing
up
along
the
route
to
one
of
the
largest
stadiums
in
the
"world,"
the
largest
cricket
stadium
in
the
"world,"
which
is
brand
new
and
beautiful.
but
you
know
"what,"
and
the
only
problem
with
doing
"that,"
prime
minister
modi
"said,"
"\"we"
will
have
10
million
people
greet
"you.\""
here's
my
problem.
we
have
a
packed
house.
we
have
a
lot
of
"people,"
thousands
of
people
that
couldn't
get
in.
it's
going
to
look
like
peanuts
from
now
on.
i'll
never
be
satisfied
with
the
crowd.
if
we
have
10
million
people
in
"india,"
how
can
i
be
satisfied
if
we
fill
up
a
"60,000"
seat
stadium?
big
deal.
"see,"
i'm
getting
spoiled.
he
"said,"
"\"build"
a
bigger
"stadium.\""
that's
good.
"colorado,"
very
good.
but
it's
going
to
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
phrase
made
in
the
usa.
that
beautiful
phrase.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer.
they've
made
such
"progress,"
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
we
started
a
year
ago.
it
should
have
been
started
long
before
in
the
last
administration
because
they
had
the
technology
then.
they
didn't
start
"it,"
but
we're
starting
it.
we'll
have
it
done
within
nine
years.
it's
a
10
year
process.
think
of
that.
aids.
we
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
become
the
first
station
in
the
world
to
plant
our
flag
on
mars.
you
have
a
lot
of
that
action
happening
right
here.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
that's
a
big
one.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
"one,"
beautiful
america.
we
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united

we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
"trust,"
from
pueblo
to
fort

from
denver
to
"durango,"
from

forest
to
"broomfield,"
from

to
right
here
in
colorado

we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
red
blooded
american
patriots
who
poured
out
their
"heart,"
and
"sweat,"
and
"soul,"
to
secure
our
liberty

we
begin.
thank
"you,"

and
thank
you
to
vice
president
mike
pence.
we
"begin,"
we
begin
our
campaign.
thank
you.
we
begin
our
campaign
and
i
just
want
to
thank
all
of
"you,"
you
are
warriors.
i've
been
watching
the
fake
news
for
weeks
"now,"
and
everything
is
negative.
don't
"go,"
don't
"come,"
don't
do
anything.
today
it
was
"like,"
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
you
are
"warriors,"
thank
you.
we
had
some
very
bad
people
outside.
we
had
some
very
bad
people
"outside,"
they
were
doing
bad
things.
but
i
really
"do,"
i
appreciate
it.
we
have
just
a
tremendous
group
of
people
in
oklahoma.
and
i
"hear,"
i
hear
from
your
two
great
senators
and
your
governor
that
we're
doing
very
well
in
"oklahoma,"
that's
the
word.
that's
the
word.
i
stand
before
you
today
to
declare
the
silent
majority
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
five
months
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
defeat
sleepy
joe
biden.
"boy,"
does
he
get
a
pass
from
these
"people,"
huh?
we're
going
to
stop
the
radical
left.
we're
going
to
build
a
future
of
safety
and
opportunity
for
americans
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
republicans
are
the
party
of
"liberty,"
"equality,"
and
justice
for
all.
we
are
the
party
of
abraham
lincoln
and
we
are
the
party
of
law
and
order.
think
of
what
we've
done.
we
will
have
close
to
300
federal
judges
appointed
and
approved
by
the
end
of
my
first
"time,"
that's
an
all
time
record.
that's
an
all
time
record.
i've
always
heard
how
important
judges
are.
now
we
know
how
important
they
are.
think
of
that
over
"300,"
around
"300,"
by
the
end
of
the
term.
and
when
we
have
another
four
"years,"
we're
going
to
have
a
"big,"
big
percentage
of
the
total
number.
very
"important,"
november
3rd.
and
two
great
supreme
court
judges.
so
we
have
two
justices
of
the
supreme
"court,"
justice
"gorsuch,"
justice
"kavanaugh,"
they're
great.
they
"are,"
they're
great.
we
have
two.
and
we
could
get
a
few
"more,"
"yeah,"
we
can
get
a
few
more.
we've
spent
over
$2
trillion
to
completely
rebuild
the
unmatched
strength
and
power
of
the
united
states
military.
and
all
of
that
incredible
"equipment,"
whether
it's
submarines
or
missiles
or
rockets
or
jet
"fighters,"
"bombers,"
it's
all
built
in
the
usa.
we
passed
v.a.
choice.
thank
you
very
"much,"
jim.
where's
my
senator?
jim
"inhofe,"
you
better
vote
for
"him,"
he's
"running,"
he's
great.
but
we'll
get
to
him
and
james
lankford
in
a
"second,"
two
great
senators.
you
have
two
great
senators.
so
we
passed
v.a.
choice.
so
if
you're
a
"veteran,"
for
years
and
"years,"
they've
wanted
to
do
it
for
almost
50
"years,"
we
got
it
done.
we
get
a
lot
of
things
done.
and
so
if
you're
a
veteran
and
you
have
to
wait
on
line
for
one
"week,"
two
"weeks,"
three
"weeks,"
five
"weeks,"
seven
"weeks,"
two
months.
what
happens
is
you
go
"outside,"
you
get
a
private
"doctor,"
you
get
fixed
up
and
they
pay
your
bill.
we
take
care
of
the
bill.
we
take
care
of
the
bill
and
you
get
immediate
service.
it's
never
happened
before.
and
our
approval
rating
at
the
v.a.
is
now
"91%,"
that's
how
good
it
is.
never
been
anywhere
near
that
number.
never
been
anywhere
near
that
number.
and
v.a.
"accountability,"
we
had
a
lot
of
bad
people
in
the
v.a.
people
that
didn't
love
our
"vets,"
people
that
were
"sadistic,"
people
that
"stole,"
a
lot
of
bad
people.
you
couldn't
get
rid
of
them
because
they
"were,"
let's
say
it
could
be
"unions,"
it
could
be
civil
"service,"
"right,"
let's
"say,"
let's
just
say.
and
so
you
couldn't
get
it
done.
that
was
another
one
for
decades
and
"decades,"
they
wanted
to
get
it
changed.
and
i
got
it
done
with
those
people
and
your
"congressman,"
your
congressman
who
i'm
going
to
introduce.
v.a.
"accountability,"
and
now
somebody
treats
our
veterans
badly
and
we
look
at
them
and
what
do
we
say?
we
"say,"
you're
"fired,"
get
"out,"
right?
get
out.
they
got
rid
of
a
lot
of
bad
people
that
were
there
for
a
long
time.
sort
of
like
me
in
"washington,"
draining
the
swamp.
i
never
knew
it
was
so
deep.
but
it's
happening.
it's
"happening,"
i
never
knew
it
was
so
deep.
it's
deep
and
thick
and
a
lot
of
bad
characters.
thank
you.
we're
lowering
the
price
of
prescription
"drugs,"
making
our
allies
pay
their
fair
share.
they
get
a
big
bargain
on
drug
prices
and
enacting
fair
trade
deals.
that
"finally,"
"finally,"
after
all
these
years
put
america
first.
i've
been
saying
it
for
a
long
time.
we
passed
the
largest
tax
cuts
in
the
history
of
our
country.
the
democrats
want
to
raise
your
taxes.
tell
me
about
that.
tell
me
about
that.
i
guess
i'm
old
fashioned.
all
my
"life,"
all
my
"life,"
i
heard
politicians
want
to
lower
"taxes,"
not
raise
them.
if
you
could
lower
"him,"
you
couldn't
lose.
the
democrats
want
to
substantially
raise
your
taxes.
how
do
you
figure
that?
how
do
you
figure
that?
and
regulation
"cuts,"
we
passed
more
regulation
cuts
than
any
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
with
the
help
of
our
great
energy
"workers,"
many
of
them
come
from
the
great
state
of
oklahoma.
do
you
ever
notice
that
"biden,"
"no,"
do
you
ever
notice
that
biden
oftentimes
gets
the
state
wrong?
he's
in
iowa
and
he
says
it's
good
to
be
in
idaho.
"no,"
"no,"
you're
in
iowa.
he's
in
new

and
he
says
it's
great
to
be
in
ohio.
"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
you're
in
new
hampshire.
that
happens
to
him
all
the
"time,"
hasn't
happened
to
me
yet.
when
that
"happens,"
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
make
up
for
it.
you
might
as
well
just
walk
off
the
stage
because
the
speech
is
a
disaster.
"right,"
right.
but
we
just
turned
the
united
states
into
the
dominant
energy
super
power
of
the
"world,"
of
the
world.
and
because
of
the
chinese
"virus,"
what
happened
about
three
months
"ago,"
it
looked
like
we
were
in
big
trouble
and
we
"were,"
and
i
got
it
back
together.
i
called
russia.
"right,"
i
called
russia.
i
called
saudi
arabia
and
believe
it
or
"not,"
i
called
mexico.
mexico
was
a
little
bit
tough.
that's
called
opec
"plus,"
did
you
ever
hear
of
opec
plus.
that's
opec
plus
plus.
and
we
got
them
to
do
the
right
thing
and
we
have
our
energy
back
to
almost
$40
a
"barrel,"
meaning
you
have
an
energy
business
again.
almost
$40
a
barrel.
couple
of
months
"ago,"
it
was
zero
and
we
were
going
to
lose
10
million
energy
"jobs,"
10
million
jobs.
so
texas
and
oklahoma
and
north
"dakota,"
and
many
other
states
would
have
been
hurt.
now
you
think
you're
going
to
be
hurt
there.
you
try
putting
aoc
in
judge
of
your
energy.
that
will
make
the
pandemic
look
like
child's
play
to
the
people
in
energy.
she
has
one
"problem,"

no
president

done

and

half

not
even
close.

how
about
the
cnn
"anchor,"
how
about
the
cnn
"anchor,"
you
"know,"
did
a
little
shave
job
in
the
"head,"
which
is
fine.
and
he's
standing
in
front
of
a
building
"saying,"
"\"things"
are
very
peaceful
"here.\""
and
the
building
"is,"
it
looks
like
the
biggest
fire
i've
ever
seen.
the
whole
town
is
burning.
it's
like
the
biggest
fire.
and
he
"said,"
"\"things"
are
very
good
"here,"
anderson.
i
think
it's
great.
these
are
wonderful
"people,"
"anderson.\""
did
you
ever
see
that?
it
looked
like
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end.
and
we
did
something
in
minneapolis
after
watching
for
three
or
four
"days,"
i
"called,"
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
get
…
you
can't
protect
"yourselves.\""
i
got
them
to
take
"8,000"
national
guardsmen.
and
in
one
hour
it
all
ended
and
they
rode
through
the
next
three
weeks
with
no
problem.
and
we
did
the
same
thing
in
other
cities.
but
how
about
seattle?
isn't
that
great?
so
they
take
over
a
big
chunk
of
a
city
called
seattle.
i
"mean,"
we're
not
talking
about
some
little
"place,"
we're
talking
about
seattle.
have
you
ever
been
to
seattle?
they
took
over
a
big
chunk
and
the
"governor,"
who's
radical
"left,"
all
of
these
places
i
talk
about
are
"democrat,"
you
know
"that,"
every
one
of
"them,"
every
one
of
them.
and
i'd
have
an
offer
"out,"
i
"said,"
"\"anytime"
you
want
we'll
come
"in,"
we'll
straighten
it
out
in
one
hour
or
"less.\""
now
i
may
be
"wrong,"
but
it's
probably
better
for
us
to
just
watch
that
disaster.
i
flew
in
with
some
of
our
great
"congressmen,"
who
we're
going
to
introduce
it
a
second.
and
i
said
to
"them,"
"\"congressmen,"
what
do
you
think?
i
can
straighten
it
out
"fast,"
should
we
just
go
in?
"no,"
sir.
let
it
simmer
for
a
little
while.
let
people
see
what
radical
left
democrats
will
do
to
our
"country.\""
but
americans
have
watched
left
wing
"radicals,"
burn
down
"buildings,"
loot
"businesses,"
destroy
private
"property,"
injure
hundreds
of
dedicated
police
offices.
these
police
"officers,"
they
get
"injured,"
they
don't
complain.
they're
incredible.
and
injure
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
only
to
hear
the
radical
fake
news
say
what
a
beautiful
rally
it
was.
and
they
never
talk
about
covid.
they
don't
talk
"about,"
when
you
see
"25,000"
people
walking
down
fifth
avenue
or
walking
down
a
street
of
a
democrat
run
"city,"
you
never
hear
them
"saying,"
they're
not
wearing
their
mask.
you
don't
hear
their
"say,"
as
they're
breaking
windows
and
running
in.
and
then
when
i
say
the
"looters,"
the
"anarchists,"
the
"agitators,"
they
"say,"
"\"what"
a
terrible
thing
for
our
president
to
"say,"
what
a
terrible
"thing.\""
but
you
don't
hear
them
talking
about
"covid,"
"covid,"
to
be
"specific,"
covid-19.
that
name
gets
further
and
further
away
from
"china,"
as
opposed
to
calling
it
the
chinese
virus.
and
despite
the
fact
that
we
…
i
have
done
a
phenomenal
job
with
"it,"
i
shut
down
the
united
states
to
very
heavily
infected
but
all
people
from
china
in
late
"january,"
which
is
months
earlier
than
other
people
would
have
done
"it,"
if
they
would
have
done
it
at
all.
i
saved
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives.
we
don't
ever
get
even
a
mention.
then
i
closed
it
down
to
europe
"early,"
closed
it
down
because
i
saw
what
was
happening.
and
by
the
"way,"
most
people
"said,"
don't
do
"it,"
don't
do
it.
we
saved
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
and
all
we
do
is
get
hit
on
like
we're
terrible.
and
what
we've
done
with
the
ventilators
and
with
the
medical
equipment.
and
with
"testing,"
you
"know,"
testing
is
a
double
edged
sword.
we've
tested
now
25
million
people.
it's
probably
20
million
people
more
than
anybody
else.
germany's
done
a
lot.
south
korea
has
done
a
lot.
they
called
"me,"
they
"said,"
the
job
you're
doing
…
here's
the
bad
part.
when
you
do
testing
to
that
"extent,"
you're
going
to
find
more
"people,"
you're
going
to
find
more
cases.
so
i
said
to
my
people
slow
the
testing
"down,"
please.
they
test
and
they
test.
we
had
tests
and
people
don't
know
what's
going
on.
we
got
"tests,"
we
got
another
one
over
here.
the
young
man's
10-years-old.
he's
got
the
sniffles.
he'll
recover
in
about
15
minutes.
that's
a
"case,"
add
him
to
it.
that's
okay.
that's
a
case.
i
was
actually
with
a
very
nice
"man,"
very
good
"man,"
even
though
he's
very
"liberal,"
the
governor
of
new
"jersey,"
right?
we
know
him?
now
"listen,"
he
said
to
"me,"
something
that's
amazing.
new
jersey
was
very
heavily
"hit,"
very
hard
"hit,"
thousands
of
people.
he
said
with
thousands
of
people
that
"died,"
thousands
of
"people,"
there
was
only
one
person
that
died
under
the
age
of
18.
would
you
believe
that?
which
tells
me
one
"thing,"
that
kids
are
much
stronger
than
us.
when
you
see
a
little
kid
running
around
"say,"
"\"boy,"
"oh,"
"boy,"
do
you
have
a
great
immune
system?
how
about
a
piece
of
your
immune
"system?\""
they
don't
even
know
about
this.
let's
open
the
"schools,"
please.
open
the
schools.
open
the
schools.
we
got
to
get
them
open.
in
the
"fall,"
we
got
to
get
them
open.
the
unhinged
left
wing
mob
is
trying
to
vandalize
our
"history,"
desecrate
our
"monuments,"
our
beautiful
monuments.
tear
down
our
statues
and
"punish,"
cancel
and
persecute
anyone
who
does
not
conform
to
their
demands
for
absolute
and
total
control.
we're
not
"conforming,"
that's
why
we're
"here,"
actually.
this
cruel
campaign
of
censorship
and
exclusion
violates
everything
we
hold
dear
as
americans.
they
want
to
demolish
our
heritage
so
they
can
impose
their
new
oppressive
regime
in
its
place.
they
want
to
defund
and
dissolve
our
police
"departments,"
think
of
that.
00
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
a
very
"tough,"
i've
used
the
word
on
"occasion,"
"hombre,"
a
very
tough
hombre
is
breaking
into
the
window
of
a
young
woman
whose
husband
is
away
as
a
traveling
salesman
or
whatever
he
may
do.
and
you
call
911
and
they
"say,"
"\"i'm"
"sorry,"
this
number's
no
longer
"working.\""
by
the
"way,"
you
have
many
cases
like
"that,"
"many,"
"many,"
many.
whether
it's
a
young
"woman,"
an
old
"woman,"
a
young
man
or
an
old
man
and
you're
sleeping.
so
what
are
you
going
to
"do,"
right?
so
they
want
to
defund.
they
really
"do,"
this
as
a
serious
movement.
and
in
"minneapolis,"
the
council's
already
passed
it.
in
"seattle,"
you
see
what's
going
on
"there,"
it's
even
"worse,"
okay.
these
people
are
stone
cold
crazy.
they're
"crazy,"
you
want
to
say
that
beautiful
heritage
of
"ours,"
we
have
a
great
heritage.
we're
a
great
country.
you
are
so
lucky
i'm
"president,"
that's
all
i
can
tell
you.
people
have
come
up
to
"me,"
"say,"
"\"how"
do
you
take
"it?\""
i
"say,"
"\"do"
i
have
a
choice?
do
i
have
a
"choice?\""
we
deal
with
a
lot
of
bad
"people,"
but
we're
winning.
and
every
once
in
a
"while,"
i'll
have
one
of
these
days
where
i'm
hit
left
and
"right,"
left
and
"right,"
like
even
this
great
event.
if
you
could
have
seen
outside
or
if
you
could
have
heard
the
"reports,"
the
"reports,"
"\"oh,"
it's
"covid.\""
it's
this
again.
by
the
"way,"
it's
a
disease
without
"question,"
has
more
names
than
any
disease
in
history.
i
can
"name,"
"\"kung"
"flu.\""
i
can
"name,"
19
different
versions
of
names.
many
call
it
a
"virus,"
which
it
is.
many
call
it
a
"flu,"
what
difference?
i
think
we
have
19
or
20
versions
of
the
name.
but
they
say
to
"me,"
"\"where"
do
you
get
the
"energy?\""
i
"say,"
"\"i"
don't
have
a
choice.
i
don't
have
a
"choice.\""
it
was
"interesting,"
to
show
you
how
fake
they
"are,"
you
might've
seen
it.
so
last
week
they
called
me
and
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
west
"point,"
west
"point,"
we're
"ready.\""
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
right.
i
have
to
make
the
commencement
speech
at
west
"point.\""
just
to
show
you
how
bad
the
fake
news
"is,"
so
they
say
to
"me,"
"\"sir,"
we're
ready
to
"go.\""
i
"say,"
"\"let's"
"go.\""
this
is
after
saying
hello
to
a
lot
of
"cadets,"
inspecting
little
areas
of
a
"building,"
that
was
very
exciting.
"actually,"
it's
"beautiful,"
very
old.
studied
a
lot
of
our
great
"generals,"
some
of
our
presidents
that
went
there.
west
point
is
"beautiful,"
right
on
the
hudson
river.
but
after
an
"hour,"
the
general
that
runs
it
is
a
fantastic
guy.
after
an
"hour,"
we
"land,"
we
do
some
more
inspections
and
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
are
you
ready?
"yes,"
i
"am.\""
so
we
walked
like
the
equivalent
of
about
three
"blocks,"
which
is
fine.
we
go
"onstage,"
which
is
fine.
they
make
"speeches,"
then
i
make
a
speech
that
lasted
a
long
time.
i
don't
"know,"
maybe
45
"minutes,"
maybe
"longer,"
i
don't
know
but
a
long
time.
the
sun
is
pouring
down
on
"me,"
okay.
but
they
said
to
me
before
the
"speech,"
"\"sir,"
would
you
like
to
salute
each
"cadet,"
each
single
cadet?
or
maybe
there'll
be
in
groups
of
two.
would
you
like
to
salute?
like
this?
"yes.\""
like
"this,"
almost
600
times.
you
know
what
that
is?
600
times.
thank
god
they
were
in
twos
because
let
me
tell
"you,"
you
do
that
600
"times,"
you
go
home
and
you
say
it's
like
a
workout
without
a
"weight,"
right?
600
times.
so
i
did
that.
then
the
incredible
"helicopters,"
brand
new
gorgeous
"helicopters,"
the
apaches
and
the
other
new
ones
that
we
just
bought
like
"that,"
but
i
make
this
speech.
i
salute
for
probably
an
hour
and
a
"half,"
maybe
"more,"
but
around
that.
watch.
if
i'm
off
by
two
minutes
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"
exaggerated.
it
was
only
an
hour
and
25
minutes.
he
"exaggerated,"
he
"lied,"
he
"lied,"
he's
a
"liar.\""
these
people
are
"sick,"
the
fake
news.
so
then
i
finish
saluting
my
final
"salute,"
i
"said,"
"\"thank"
goodness.
thank
you
very
"much.\""
think
of
it.
so
essentially
almost
600
times.
now
the
general
"says,"
"\"sir,"
are
you
"ready?\""
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
ready
"general,"
where
are
we
going
"now?\""
you
have
to
understand
i
left
early
in
the
morning
to
get
there.
now
it's
sort
of
late
in
the
afternoon.
a
lot
of
these
fakers
were
with
us.
so
they
know.
he
"said,"
"\""
"sir,"
we
can
now
leave
the
"stage.\""
i
"said,"
"\"great"
"general,"
let's
"go,"
i'll
follow
"you,\""
and
he
goes
like
"this,"
"\"right"
"here,"
"sir,\""
and
i
walked
off.
the
stage
was
higher
than
this
one
and
the
ramp
was
probably
10
yards
long.
i
"say,"
"\"general.\""
now
you
got
to
"understand,"
i
have
the
whole
corps
of
cadets
looking
at
me
and
i
want
them
to
love
their
"president,"
i
did
this
big
thing.
i
love
"them,"
i
love
them.
they're
"incredible,"
and
they
do.
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
i've
got
myself
a
"problem,"
"general.\""
because
i'm
wearing
leather
bottom
shoes
which
is
good
if
you're
walking
on
flat
surfaces.
it's
not
good
for
ramps
and
if
i
fall
"down,"
look
at
all
those
press
back
"there,"
look
at
them.
this
was
a
steel
"ramp,"
you
all
saw
it
because
everybody
saw
it.
this
was
a
steel
ramp.
it
had
no
"handrail,"
it
was
like
an
ice
skating
"rink,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
i
have
a
"problem,\""
and
he
didn't
understand
that
at
first.
i
"said,"
"\"there's"
no
"way.\""
he
"understood,"
i
just
saluted
almost
600
times.
i
just
made
a
big
speech.
i
sat
for
other
speeches.
i'm
being
baked.
i'm
being
baked
like
a
cake.
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
there's
no
way
i
can
make
it
down
that
ramp
without
falling
on
my
"ass,"
general.
i
have
no
"railing.\""
it's
true.
so
i
"said,"
"\"is"
there
like
something
else
"around?\""
"\"sir,"
the
ramp
is
ready
to
"go.\""
"\"grab"
me
"sir,"
grab
"me.\""
i
didn't
really
want
to
grab
him.
you
know
why?
because
i
"said,"
"\"that"
will
be
a
story
"too.\""
so
now
i
have
a
choice.
i
can
stay
up
there
for
another
couple
of
hours
and
wait
till
i'm
rescued
or
i
can
go
down
this
really
"steep,"
"really,"
"really,"
really
…
it's
an
ice
skating
"rink,"
it's
brutal.
so
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
get
ready
because
i
may
grab
you
so
"fast.\""
because
i
can't
fall
with
the
fake
news
watching.
if
i
"fall,"
if
i
"fall,"
i
remember
when
president
ford
fell
out
of
the
"plane,"
do
you
remember?
i
remember
when
another
"president,"
nice
"man,"
threw
up
in
"japan,"
and
they
did
slow
motion
replays.
it's
"true,"
right?
"\"i"
don't
want
"that,"
"general.\""
now
he's
standing
"there,"
big
strong
"guy,"
and
he's
got
these
shoes
but
they're
loaded
with
rubber
on
the
bottom
because
i
"looked,"
the
first
thing
i
"did,"
i
looked
at
his
shoes.
then
i
looked
at
mine.
"very,"
very
slippery.
so
i
end
up
"saying,"
"\"okay,"
"general,"
let's
go.
i
will
only
grab
you
if
i
need
you.
that's
not
a
good
story.
falling
would
be
a
disaster.
it
turned
out
to
be
worse
than
"anything,"
i
would
have
been
better
off
if
i
fell
and
slid
down
the
damn
ramp.
right?
so
what
happens
is
i
start
the
"journey,"
inch
by
"inch,"
right?
i
was
really
bent
over
too.
i
didn't
like
that.
i
didn't
like
this
picture.
this
picture
i'm
sure
will
be
an
ad
by
the
fakers.
so
i
was
bent
"over,"
right?
bent
over
like
this.
then
we
finally
reached
almost
the
end
and
the
fake
"news,"
the
most
dishonest
human
"beings,"
they
cut
it
off.
you
know
why?
because
when
i
was
10
feet
"short,"
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
i'm
"sorry,\""
and
i
ran
down
the
"rest,"
right?
i
looked
very
handsome.
that
was
the
only
good.
i
wouldn't
want
to
run
down
the
whole
thing
because
the
fall
there
would
be
definitely
bad.
so
i
took
these
little
"steps,"
i
ran
down
the
last
"10,"
and
by
the
way
their
"tape,"
take
a
look.
in
almost
every
"instance,"
it
ends
just
before
i
"run,"
and
they
"said,"
"\"here"
was
the
number
one
trending
"story.\""
i
call
my
"wife,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
good
was
that
speech?
i
thought
it
was
a
"…\""
hey
"look,"
i
will
tell
you
when
i
make
good
ones
and
bad
ones.
like
so
far
"tonight,"
i'm
"average,"
but
we're
having
"fun,"
we're
having
fun.
so
far
"tonight,"
but
i
call
my
wife
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
good
was
"it,"
"darling?\""
she
"said,"
"\"you're"
trending
number
"one.\""
i
said
to
our
great
first
"lady,"
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
ask
you
a
question.
was
it
that
good
of
a
speech
that
i'm
trending
number
one?
because
i
felt
it
was
really
"good.\""
no
"no,"
they
don't
even
mention
the
speech.
they
mention
the
fact
that
you
may
have
parkinson's
disease.
it's
true.
it's
true.
it's
true.
they
say
there
is
something
wrong
with
our
president.
i'll
let
you
know
if
there's
something
"wrong,"
okay?
i'll
let
you
know
if
there's
"something,"
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
there's
something
wrong
with
"biden,"
that
i
could
tell
you.
so
then
my
wife
"said,"
"\"well"
it
wasn't
only
the
ramp.
did
you
have
"water?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah."
i
was
speaking
for
a
long
time.
i
didn't
want
to
drink
"it,"
but
i
wanted
to
wet
my
lips
a
little
"bit.\""
you're
"drinking,"
you're
working
hard
up
there
with
the
sun
pouring
down
on
you.
i
love
this
"location,"
the
sun's
like
this.
this
way
they
save
on
"lighting,"
right?
that's
why
they
did
it
probably.
so
what
happens
is
i
"said,"
"\"what"
does
it
have
to
do
with
"water?\""
they
"said,"
"\"you"
couldn't
lift
your
hand
up
to
your
mouth
with
"water.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
just
saluted
600
times
like
"this,"
and
this
was
before
i
"saluted,"
so
what's
the
"problem?\""
she
"said,"
"\"well"
i
know
what
you
did.
you
had
on
a
very
good
red
tie
that's
sort
of
"expensive.\""
it's
silk
because
they
look
better.
they
have
a
better
sheen
to
them.
and
i
don't
want
to
get
water
on
the
"tie,"
and
i
don't
want
to
drink
"much,"
so
i
lift
it
"up,"
the
water.
it's
so
unfair.
it
really
is.
so
unfair.
they
are
among
the
most
dishonest
people
anywhere
on
earth.
they're
bad
people.
bad
people.
"okay,"
that's
enough
of
that.
i
wanted
to
tell
that
story.
does
everybody
understand
that
story?
the
left-wing
anarchists
tore
down
a
statue
of
thomas
jefferson.
now
we're
getting
into
the
real
stuff.
they
decapitated
a
statue
of
christopher
"columbus,"
except
in
new
york
when
the
italians
surrounded
it.
they
didn't
have
too
much
of
a
chance.
those
"italians,"
i
love
the
italians.
they
heard
they
were
going
to
rip
down
their
beautiful
christopher
columbus
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
circle
that
thing.
they
didn't
do
too
well
in
hurting
"christopher,"
did
they?
thank
you
to
our
italian
"population,"
we're
very
proud
of
"you,"
right?
two
days
"ago,"
leftist
radicals
in
"portland,"
oregon
ripped
down
a
statue
of
george
washington
and
wrapped
it
in
an
american
flag
and
set
the
american
flag
on
fire.
"democrat,"
all
democrat.
everything
i
tell
you
is
democrat
and
you
know
we
ought
to
do
"something,"
mr.
"senators,"
we
have
two
great
"senators,"
we
ought
to
come
up
with
legislation
that
if
you
burn
the
american
"flag,"
you
go
to
jail
for
one
year.
one
year.
jim
and
james.
jim
and
james.
we
ought
to
do
it.
you
know
they
talk
about
freedom
of
speech
and
i'm
a
big
believer
in
freedom
of
"speech,"
but
that's
"desecration,"
that's
a
terrible
thing
they
do.
we
used
to
have
"things,"
we
don't
have
them
anymore
because
we
want
to
be
so
"open,"
so
"everything,"
and
look
what
happens?
we
should
have
legislation
that
if
somebody
wants
to
burn
the
american
flag
and
stomp
on
it
or
just
burn
"it,"
they
go
to
jail
for
one
"year,"
okay?
in
seattle
the
democrat
mayor
and
the
democrat
city
council
have
surrendered
control
of
six
city
blocks
to
an
anarchist
…
now
these
are
"anarchists,"
these
are
not
protestors.
you
listen
to
the
fake
"news,"
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
the
protesters
were
"lovely.\""
could
you
imagine
if
people
just
even
slightly
to
the
right
tried
to
take
over
seattle?
they'd
have
machine
guns
out
to
get
"them,"
but
these
people
can
take
over
the
"city,"
look
at
what
they've
done
to
businesspeople
that
have
spent
years
and
years
building
their
"business,"
and
now
they're
wiped
out.
take
it
away.
governor
inslee
ought
to
get
his
act
"together,"
get
in
"there,"
i'll
help
"you,"
i'll
do
whatever
you
want.
i'm
waiting
for
a
"call,"
i
would
love
to
do
it.
i
would
love
to
do
"it,"
it'll
take
less
than
an
hour
and
it'll
all
be
over
with
and
you'll
have
your
city
back.
yet
biden
remains
silent
in
his
basement
in
the
face
of
this
brutal
assault
on
our
nation
and
the
values
of
our
nation.
joe
biden
has
surrendered
to
his
party
and
to
the
left-wing
mob.
he
has
no
control.
does
anybody
honestly
think
he
controls
these
radial
maniacs?
you
know
what
he
says
to
his
wife
when
he's
not
confusing
her
with
his
sister?
"\"get"
me
the
hell
out
of
there.
these
people
are
"crazy.\""
that's
what
he
says.
he
has
absolutely
no
control.
you
know
a
lot
of
times
i'll
make
like
a
speech
and
i'll
have
this
beautiful
paragraph
come
out
criticizing
every
little
aspect
of
the
"speech,"
"beautiful,"
"brilliant,"
but
joe
didn't
…
it'll
"say,"
"\"a"
comment
from
joe
"biden,\""
but
he
didn't
say
it.
professional
"people,"
great
students
in
english
"lit,"
people
that
are
very
smart
say
it.
joe
biden
"said,"
and
they'll
go
into
this
highly
complex
"paragraph,"
beautifully
worded
and
i
"say,"
"\"joe"
didn't
say
that.
joe
doesn't
even
understand
"it.\""
wait
a
"minute,"
air
force
one
is
31
years
old.
people
don't
realize
that.
so
i
"said,"
they
gave
me
a
"charge,"
very
early
in
my
administration
like
how
about
the
first
week?
"\"sir,"
would
you
sign
for
this
"plane?\""
now
it's
actually
two
planes.
"\"would"
you
sign
for
this
plane?
air
force
"one?\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
old
is
the
original
or
the
one
we
have
"now?\""
"\"sir,"
it's
"31,"
32
"years.\""
i'd
see
people
coming
in
from
foreign
lands
that
can't
compete
with
"us,"
rich
countries
but
they
can't
compete
with
the
…
they
have
a
brand
new
beautiful
"747-800,"
and
i
"say,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
that
country
has
new
and
we
have
a
"31-year,"
so
somebody
had
to
do
"…\"."
this
was
the
boeing
before
that
and
they
were
riding
"high,"
like
i
was
before
this
thing
came
"in,"
but
we're
still
riding
high
because
you
know
what?
on
november
3
we're
going
to
win.
we're
going
to
win.
so
they
came
in
and
they
came
in
and
they
"said,"
"\"no"
no
"no,"
we
want
$5.6
"billion,"
whatever
it
"was.\""
whatever
it
"was,"
if
i'm
a
little
bit
off
they'll
go
crazy.
"whatever,"
but
it
was
a
lot.
$5.6
billion.
"nope,"
got
to
have
a
three.
got
to
have
a
"three,"
call
me
up.
"nope,"
cancel
the
contract.
i
"said,"
"\"cancel"
the
contract.
i
want
it
"canceled.\""
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
can
you
cancel
the
"contract?\""
he
"said,"
"\"yes"
"sir,"
i'm
very
proud
of
"it.\""
"\"oh"
good.
cancel
"it.\""
"\"okay"
"sir.\""
"\"by"
the
"way,"
to
cancel
"it,"
do
you
have
to
pay
"anything?\""
"\"yes"
sir.
we
have
a
cancellation
fee
"sir.\""
"\"how"
much
is
"it,"
"general?\""
"\"$250"
"million.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what?\""
"\"sir,"
we
made
a
good
deal.
$250
million
to
"kill.\""
"\"you"
mean
if
we
don't
buy
the
plane
we
have
to
hand
them
$250
"million.\""
that's
not
"good,"
right?
look
at
these
two
"guys,"
they're
looking.
by
the
"way,"
that's
like
a
good
story
compared
to
some
i
could
tell
"you,"
like
with
aircraft
carriers.
so
they
"said,"
"\"$250"
"million?\""
or
i
always
say
"this,"
or
around
that
"number,"
because
if
i'm
off
by
a
little
"bit,"
they
"say,"
"\"oh,"
he
"exaggerates.\""
i
look
at
numbers
all
day
long.
that's
what
i
look
at
for
years
"now,"
for
my
whole
life
when
you
think
of
it.
$250
million
cancellation
"fee,"
sir.
he
was
very
proud
of
himself.
what
a
great
…
i
"say,"
"\"general."
don't
cancel.
don't
cancel.
just
tell
them
i
don't
want
the
planes.
don't
put
anything
in
"writing,"
don't
put
it
in
"writing,"
"general.\""
"\"why"
"sir?\""
"\"because"
i
don't
want
to
pay
"250.\""
true.
you
hear
that
jim?
jim
"inhofe,"
he's
great.
you
hear
that
jim?
you
know
that
story.
he
does
a
great
job.
so
here's
what
"happened,"
the
bottom
line.
boeing
"says,"
"\"no"
"way,"
no
"way,"
no
"way.\""
the
next
week
they
"say,"
"\"no"
way
we're
doing
"it.\""
the
next
week
they
"said,"
"\"how"
about
$5
"billion?\""
i
"said,"
"\"no"
way.
no
"way.\""
the
next
week
they
"said,"
"\"$4.8.\""
i
"said,"
"\"nope."
it's
got
to
have
a
3
at
the
front
of
it.
don't
you
"understand,"
you
dumb
son
of
a
bitch?
don't
you
"understand?\""
i
turned
out
to
be
right.
turned
out
to
be
right.
nobody
gets
that.
nope.
got
to
have
a
three.
next
"day,"
they
come
"back,"
"\"$4.5"
is
our
best
"offer.\""
"\"nope."
i'm
not
doing
it.
i'm
not
doing
it.
come
back
when
you're
"ready.\""
a
month
goes
"by,"
another
"month,"
they
never
heard
about
"it,"
they
never
heard
from
"me,"
they
thought
i
was
"serious,"
i
"was,"
and
they
came
back
at
$4
billion.
that's
a
lot
of
money
but
i
save
like
a
billion
six
or
a
billion
seven.
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
it.
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
it.
when
i
get
foreign
nations
to
pay
us
billions
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
that.
when
i
take
soldiers
out
of
countries
because
they're
not
treating
us
"properly,"
germany
is
an
example.
i
mean
i
have
a
german
heritage
like
some
of
you.
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
get
it
down
from
"$50,000.00"
to
"$25,000.00"
because
they're
delinquent.
for
many
years
they're
delinquent.
they
haven't
been
paying
what
they're
supposed
to
be
paying.
they're
paying
1%
instead
of
2%
and
2%
is
a
very
low
"number,\""
and
they
"say,"
"\"yes,"
we
think
by
and
they
"say,"
"yes,"
we
think
by
"2030,"
maybe
"2032,"
we
could
get
current.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"angela,"
please.
don't
say
that
angela.
it's
true.
you
know
who
i'm
talking
about.
by
the
"way,"
very
nice
woman.
very
good
negotiator.
i
"said,"
"\"angela,"
that's
a
long
"time,\""
this
was
in
2019.
she
said
2032.
i
"said,"
"\"no"
"angela,"
that's
not
"working.\""
but
i
"said,"
because
now
they
want
to
get
"cared,"
but
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
what
about
the
last
25
years?
all
the
money
you
owe
"us?\""
everybody
forgot
about
that.
they
forget
about
all
the
money
that
wasn't
paid.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
the
trillion
dollars
that
you
really
"owe?\""
so
we're
negotiating
let's
"see,"
but
in
the
"meantime,"
we're
reducing
our
troops.
remember
"this,"
we're
supposed
to
protect
germany
from
"russia,"
but
germany
is
paying
"russia,"
billions
of
dollars
for
energy
coming
from
a
brand
new
pipeline.
so
they
pay
the
country
we're
supposed
to
protect
them
"from,"
they
pay
billions
of
dollars
to
that
country.
we're
supposed
to
protect
them.
excuse
"me,"
how
does
that
work?
and
the
great
thing
is
with
jim
inhofe
and
with
james
"lankford,"
"likewise,"
they
just
said
they
love
you
james.
when
they
hear
"it,"
they
get
it.
a
lot
of
people
don't
get
it.
they
get
it.
we
cannot
continue
to
be
ripped
off.
we're
ripped
off
by
so
many
countries
and
we're
stopping
it.
and
that
means
that
a
lot
of
people
don't
want
me
here.
they
don't
want
me.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
don't
want
me.
they
don't
sell
a
lot
of
bombs
when
we're
not
dropping
bombs
on
people.
you
know
"that,"
right?
it's
called
the
military
industrial
complex.
when
rioting
and
looting
broke
out
in
our
nation's
"capitol,"
i
very
quickly
deployed
the
national
guard.
i
"said,"
"\"get"
them
"in.\""
after
watching
for
an
evening
or
"two,"
we
stopped
the
violence
and
restored
peace
and
order
to
the
streets.
and
last
night
that
had
a
little
breakout.
"again,"
they
ripped
down
a
statue
that
was
110
years
"old,"
beautiful
piece
of
art
in
front
of
the
police
precinct
with
our
radical
left
mayor
watching
on
television.
we're
not
happy.
that's
going
to
be
very
expensive
for
dc.
they're
always
looking
for
money.
"\"we"
need
more
money.
we
always
need
more
"money.\""
and
then
they
don't
do
the
proper
job.
so
it's
not
going
to
be
good
for
mayor
"bowser,"
mayor
bowser
there.
they
were
heading
over
to
the
jefferson
memorial
recently
and
they
wanted
to
do
damage
to
our
"great,"
beautiful
jefferson
memorial.
not
going
to
happen.
don't
worry
about
it.
we
have
it
surrounded
with
very
strong
people.
the
choice
in
220
is
very
simple.
do
you
want
to
bow
before
the
left
wing
mob?
or
do
you
want
to
stand
up
tall
and
proud
as
americans.
and
explain
this
to
the
nfl.
i
like
the
nfl.
i
like
roger
"goodell,"
but
i
didn't
like
what
he
said
a
week
ago.
i
"said,"
"\"where"
did
that
come
from
in
the
middle
of
the
summer?
nobody's
even
"asking?\""
we
will
never
kneel
to
our
national
anthem
or
our
great
american
flag.
we
will
stand
proud
and
we
will
stand
tall.
i
thought
we
won
that
battle
with
the
nfl.
the
stadiums
were
emptying
out.
did
you
see
those
stadiums?
it
took
them
a
long
time
to
get
you
back.
a
lot
of
people
didn't
like
that.
a
lot
of
people
that
you
wouldn't
even
think
would
care
that
much.
i've
had
people
that
i
"said,"
"\"these"
are
super
left
liberals
and
they
didn't
like
"it.\""
joe
biden
and
the
democrats
want
to
prosecute
americans
for
going
to
"church,"
but
not
for
burning
a
church.
they
believe
you
can
"riot,"
vandalize
and
"destroy,"
but
you
cannot
attend
a
peaceful
pro-america
rally.
they
want
to
punish
your
"thought,"
but
not
their
violent
crimes.
they
want
to
abolish
"bail,"
abolish
and
open
up
your
borders.
they
want
open
"borders,"
let
"everyone,"
and
by
the
"way,"
we're
doing
so
well.
we
have
a
record
this
month
on
the

nobody's
coming
in.

few

and
they
want
to
abolish
"ice,"
our
great

the
roughest
"toughest,"
meanest

that
you've

they're
rough
guys.
they're
great
"americans,"
but
they'll
walk
"into,"
they
caught
them
in
a
pack.
they'll
walk
into
a
pack
of
tough
ms-13
gang
members.
and
we
shouldn't
say
"this,"
it's
not
nice.
they
want
us
to
negotiate.
they
start
swinging.
and
the
other
such
"way,"
everybody's
"swinging,"
at
the
"end,"
they
carry
them
back
and
they
throw
them
into
the
paddy
wagon.
they're
great.
and
these
people
want
to
get
rid
of
ice.
they
get
rid
of
murderers.
they
get
rid
of
rapists.
they
get
rid
of
the
worst

and
when
i
called

i
"said,"
"\"they're"
"animals.\""
and

they
cut

if
i
lose
an
election
over
"that,"
you
know
what?
this
country
is
in
big
trouble.
they
want
to
disarm
"law,"
abiding
citizens
and
dismantle
our
police
forces
while
freeing
vicious
ms-13
gang
members.
in
joe
biden's
"america,"
"rioters,"
"looters,"
and
criminal
aliens
have
more
rights
than
law
abiding
citizens.
and
that's
true.
in
my
"administration,"
we
defend
american
citizens
and
we
deport
ms-13
members
or
put
them
in
jail
if
we
have
to.
the
chaos
you're
seeing
in
our
democratic

these
are
all

by
the
"democrats,"
is
what

much
worse
if
we
don't
keep

joe
biden's
record
can
be
summed
up
as
four
decades
of
"betrayal,"
"calamity,"
and
failure.
he
never
did
anything.
he
was
a
senator.
he
was
a
vice
president.
he
was
before
that
something.
you
know
what's
great?
president.
trump
was
tough
on
this
or
he
was
tough.
they
"complained,"
never
did
anything
about
it.
he's
been
there
for
43
years
or
47
years.
he
never
did
anything
about
it.
biden's
supported
every
globalist
attack
on
the
american
worker
let's
make
every
country
of
the
world
rich
but
"ourselves,"
including
"nafta,"
the
disaster
of
nafta.
he
wanted
to
go
and
tpp
would
have
ruined
our
automobile
industry.
"korea,"
i
renegotiated
the
deal.
i
took
a
horrible
deal.
that
was
a
hillary
clinton
special.
that
was
a
hillary
clinton
special.
she
"said,"
"\"we"
have
to
make
this
deal
with
south
korea.
it's
going
to
mean
"250,000"
"jobs.\""
and
she
was
right
for
south
"korea,"
"250,000."
and
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
organization
was
supported
by
sleepy
joe
biden.
that
was
one
of
the
worst
deals
economically
in
the
history
of
our
country.
when
china
joined
the
world
trade
"organization,"
they
were
flat
line
for
decades.
they
became
like
a
rocket
ship.
he
voted
for
the
war
in
iraq.
he
voted
for
mass
amnesty
for
illegal
aliens.
he
supports
sanctuary
cities
and
now
biden
wants
to
end
immigration
enforcement
and
he
wants
to
require
you
to
provide
free
healthcare
for
millions
and
millions
of
illegal
aliens.
when
i
took
early
and
decisive
action
to
ban
travel
from
china
and
protect
americans
from
the
virus.
and
as
i
"said,"
joe
"biden,"
opposed
my
decision
and
called
it
"hysteria,"
xenophobia.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
word
"means,"
xenophobia
and
fear-mongering.
and
then
he
apologized
a
month
later.
he
said
he
was
"wrong,"
but
he
didn't
say
it.
and
they
didn't
cover
it.
they
didn't
cover
it.
on
one
of
the
single
most
important
policy
decisions
of
our
"lifetime,"
joe
biden
sided
with
china
over
"america,"
that's
closing
the
border.
he
thought
it
was
a
terrible
thing.
"remember,"
this
was
in
january.
that's
"early,"
"real,"
"early,"
the
end
of
january.
he
thought
it
was
a
terrible
thing.
when
we
close
the
border.
too
many
people
that
were
badly
infected
with
covid.
when
the
chips
are
"down,"
biden
will
always
cave
to
the
radical
left.
he'll
always
bow
to
the
angry
mob
and
he
will
never
protect
you
or
your
family
and
you
know
that.
joe
biden
will
always
let
you
down.
that's
been
his
history.
at
my
direction
early
this
"year,"
the
heroes
of
the
u.s.
military
took
out
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
the
savage
killer
leader
of
isis
al-baghdadi
and
the
number
one
"terrorist,"
anywhere
in
the
"world,"
qasem
soleimani.
we
took
them
out.
joe
biden
opposed
killing
soleimani.
he
was
vehemently…
we
killed
this
number
"one,"
terrorist.
he
didn't
like
it.
you
know
why
he
didn't
like
it?
because
he
thought
it
would
be
good
"politically,"
that
didn't
work
out
too
well.
just
as
he
opposed
the
raid
that
killed
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
"it,"
you
know
that.
biden
is
always
on
the
wrong
side
of
"history,"
as
said
by
people
that
are
with
him
and
worked
with
him.
he
never
made
a
correct
foreign
policy
decision.
biden
is
a
puppet
for
china.
son
walked
out
with
1.5
billion.
i
think
it's
a
little
bit…
allowing
them
to
rip
off
america
for
many
years.
now
they're
paying
us
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
we
give
a
lot
of
it
to
our
farmers.
we
have
plenty
leftover.
china
is
not
exactly
happy
with
me.
they
pay
us
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
and
they
targeted
our
great
farmers.
and
i
took
the
money
that
they
"targeted,"
i
took
that
money
and
i
gave
it
to
the
farmers.
so
they
were
even
so
they're
okay.
are
you
okay?
"come,"
"doctor,"
please.
doctor.
thank
you.
these
people
some
of
the
people
are
waiting
for
five
"days,"
especially
in
this
location.
you
take
your
"time,"
"darling,"
take
your
time.
thank
you
very
much.
take
your
time.
"doctor,"
thank
"you,"
doctor.
some
people
wait
for
four
or
five
days.
that's
incredible.
he
never
did
anything
against
"china,"
joe
biden.
and
that's
why
they
desperately
want
him
to
win.
they
want
him
to
win
so
badly.
iran
wants
him
to
win
so
badly.
let
me
tell
"you,"
i'm
going
to
make
a
very
fast
deal.
the
best
deal
you've
ever
seen.
i've
already
made
one
with
"china,"
but
i
can
make
even
more.
they
want
me
to
lose
because
they
will
own
the
united
states
if
i
lose.
iran.
president
obama
gave
them
$150
billion
for
nothing.
i
told
them.
and
look
what
happened
to
biden
in
ukraine
where
his
son's
paid
"$83,000"
a
month.
and
he
was
jobless.
give
me
a
break.
"$83,000"
a
month.
more
than
anybody.
if
joe
biden
were
to
become
president
an
emboldened
"left,"
will
launch
a
full
scale
assault
on
american
life.
you
know
that.
they'll
expel
anyone
who
disagrees
with
them.
look
what
happens
when
you
disagree.
you
use
a
term
that's
perfect
and
they're
not
happy
with
it.
they
call
you
a
racist.
they
call
you
a
horrible
person.
they
want
to
crush
religious
liberty.
they
don't
want
religion.
silence
religious
"believers,"
indoctrinate
your
children
with
hateful
and
vicious
lies
about
our
"country,"
subsidize
late
term
abortion
and
after
birth
execution.
they
want
to
take
away
your
guns
through
the
repeal
of
your
second
"amendment,"
as
sure
as
you're
sitting
there.
in
"fact,"
he
even
put
the
big
gun
"grabber,"
beto
"o'rourke,"
who
made
a
fool
out
of
himself
when
he
ran
for
president.
they
put
him
in
charge
of
guns.
lots
of
luck
on
your
second
amendment.
just
remember
i
"said,"
and
hopefully
you
won't
have
to
think
back
about
it
too
"much,"
because
it
won't
matter.
hopefully
it
won't
matter.
"no,"
beto
o'rourke
who
wants
to
give
up
guns
is
in
charge
of
the
second
amendment.
the
dems
will
also
eliminate
private
health
"insurance,"
ban
"fracking,"
that's
not
"good,"
and
american
energy
will
be
in
a
position
of
weakness
like
it's
never
been
before.
and
that's
after
we
built
the
greatest
energy
country
anywhere
in
the
world
by
far.
and
they
want
to
appoint
supreme
court
justices
who
will
utterly
obliterate
your
constitution.
and
you
now
see
how
important
the
supreme
court
is.
think
if
we
didn't
have
two
"justices,"
that
i
think
have
been
"very,"
"very,"
very
"good,"
but
think
how
important
it
is.
think
how
important
it
is.
and
we
"still,"
i
guess
it's
"a,"
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
equal
"court,"
it's
almost
like
we're
a
minority
"court,"
right?
it's
almost
like
we're
a
minority
court.
the
recent
supreme
court
cases
prove
that
if
joe
biden
is
"elected,"
he
will
stack
the
court
with
"extremists,"
the
forgotten
men
and
"women,"
together
with
everyone
else.
we'll
lose
everything.
the
forgotten
men
and
"women,"
i
campaigned
on
the
forgotten.
these
are
great
people.
these
are
substantial
people.
these
are
the
elite.
by
the
"way,"
you're
the
elite.
they're
not
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
somebody
two
days
ago
"said,"
"\"sir,"
the
elite
are
really
working
hard
on
trying
to
destroy
"you.\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
why
do
you
call
them
the
"elite,\""
i
"said,"
"\"why?\""
"\"well,"
they're
not
"elite.\""
i
look
better
than
them.
much
more
handsome.
got
better
hair
than
they
do.
i
got
nicer
properties.
i
got
nicer
houses.
i
got
nicer
apartments.
i
got
nicer
everything.
i
ran
for
politics
"once,"
just
once
in
my
life.
and
i
became
president
of
the
united
states.
and
hopefully
if
you
get
out
and
"vote,"
we'll
do
it
one
more
time.
we
won't
even
toy
with
them
about
three
or
four
more
times.
we
won't.
we'll
do
it
one
more
time.
we'll
be
two
for
two.
and
our
country
will
"never,"
ever
be
stronger.
but
i'll
be
soon
announcing
a
new
list
of
exceptional
candidates
for
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
i'll
choose
only
from
that
list.
a
hundred
"percent,"
probably
25
incredible
"people,"
any
one
of
which
could
be
a
great
"justice,"
any
one
of
which.
and
i
did
it
last
time
and
people
loved
when
i
did
it.
and
i'll
only
pick
from
that
list.
biden
can't
release
his
list
because
the
names
would
be
too
"extreme,"
too
radical.
they
wouldn't
be
"acceptable,"
but
they
will
be
very
radical
people.
people
don't
"understand,"
but
we
actually
won
on
daca
yesterday.
we
actually
won
because
they
basically
"said,"
"\"you"
"won,"
but
you
have
to
come
back
and
redo
"it.\""
it's
almost
"like,"
"\"gee,"
come
on
"back,"
your
paperwork
was
no
"good.\""
but
we're
going
to
be
"refiling,"
but
don't
let
it
get
you.
everything's
going
to
work
out
really
good.
everything's
going
to
work
out
good.
it
was
a
"great,"
it
was
great.
i
"mean,"
would
have
been
nice
if
we
won.
and
everybody
"said,"
"\"oh,"
you're
going
to
win
daca.
you're
going
to
win
daca.
that's
easy.
you
got
to
win
daca.
that's
"easy.\""
they
all
said
it.
and
they
came
back
and
they
"said,"
"\"we"
don't
like
what
you
did
with
your
"paperwork,\""
essentially.
so
we're
re-filing
it.
most
people
would
say
we
lost.
we
didn't
lose.
we're
going
to
refile
it.
and
everything
is
going
to
work
out
for
the
young
people.
most
of
whom
aren't
so
young
"anymore,"
by
the
way.
but
we're
going
to
work
it
out
for
everybody.
biden
is
fully
controlled
by
the
fringe
of
his
party.
he
is
their
pawn.
he
doesn't
even
know
where
the
hell
he
is.
let's
face
it.
he
installed
socialist
alexandria
ocasio-cortez.
to
be
in
charge
of
his
environmental
policy
and
his
energy.
"energy,"
you
can
forget
petroleum.
how
does
oklahoma
feel
about
being
petroleum
free?
not
"good,"
right?
our
country
will
have
no
energy.
our
country
will
have
nothing.
"oklahoma,"
"texas,"
north
"dakota,"
and
many
others
will
all
be
out
of
business.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
work
out
too
"well,"
but
she's
actually
in
charge
of
environmental
policy.
and
you
know
what
that
means.
she
doesn't
even
want
to
win.
she
doesn't
want
those
bird
killing
machines
that
go
round
and
round.
you
want
to
see
a
lot
of
birds
that
are
dead?
go
under
a
windmill
sometime.
she
wants
us
to
go
back
to
the
stone
ages
because
she's
got
no
"sense,"
no
credentials.
she's
got
a
little
"charisma,"
not
"much,"
but
she
doesn't
have
a
clue.
you
know
it.
but
she's
in
charge
of
the
environment.
no
airplanes.
we
can
forget
"boeing,"
i
"guess,"
come
to
think
of
it.
we
talked
about
boeing.
we
could
forget
boeing.
let's
cancel
those
brand
new
air
force
ones.
"likewise,"
representative
ilhan
omar
is
going
to
be
very
much
involved
in
a
biden
government.
they
will
put
this
hate
filled
"america,"
bashing
"socialist,"
front
and
center
in
deciding
the
fate
of
your
family
and
deciding
the
fate
of
your
country.
i
don't
think
she
would
like
to
make
the
government
of
our
country
just
like
the
country
from
where
she
"came,"
somalia.
no
"government,"
no
"safety,"
no
"police,"
no
nothing.
just
anarchy.
and
now
she's
telling
us
how
to
run
our
country.
no
thank
you.
and
i
think
we're
going
to
have
a
big
victory
in
the
state
of
"minnesota,"
because
they've
had
it.
they've
had
it.
biden
is
a
very
willing
trojan
horse
for
socialism.
when
biden
first
ran
for
president
over
33
years
"ago,"
remember
i
used
to
call
him
1%
"joe,"
he
never
got
more
than
1%
until
obama
took
him
off
the
trash
heap.
but
he
blatantly
copied
the
speech
of
a
british
"politician,"
even
ripping
off
the
man's
personal
biography
and
family
history
and
claiming
it
was
his
own.
he
forgot
to
say
he
was
born
in
america.
joe
biden
is
a
shameless
hypocrite.
since
"2003,"
he
has
delivered
fawning
eulogies
to
the
funeral.
and
at
those
funerals
of
three
leading
supporters
of
"segregation,"
including
a
former
member
of
the
"kkk,"
and
yet
biden
is
now
smearing
as
"racist,"
tens
of
millions
of
people
like
yourselves.
"decent,"
hardworking
americans
who
he's
never
met.
and
he
frankly
probably
doesn't
want
to
meet.
america
should
not
take
lectures
on
racial
justice
from
joe
biden.
sleepy
joe.
a
man
who
praised
and
partnered
with
"segregationists,"
shift
millions
of
black
american
jobs
"overseas,"
and
everyone
else's
jobs
too
by
the
way.
if
i
didn't
come
"along,"
we're
building
auto
"plants,"
we're
building
everything.
and
there's
never
been
a
comeback
like
we're
making
right
now.
never
been.
he
hollowed
out
our
middle
"class,"
including
our
black
middle
class
with
open
borders.
trapped
young
children
in
failing
government
"schools,"
built
cages.
those
cages
were
built
by
obama
and
biden.
look
it
"up,"
2014.
and
the
fake
news
doesn't
wanted
to…
remember
the
picture
of
the
cage?
a
cage
for
children.
remember
the
picture
of
the
cage.
and
they
said
president
trump.
and
then
they
realized
that
was
at
a
"newspaper,"
"2014,"
the
same…
built
by
obama
and
"biden,"
the
cages.
and
they
don't-
and
they
don't
want
to
report
the
way
it
is.
they
know
the
way
it
is.
they're
not
stupid.
they
sent
young
boys
to
fight
in
iraq
while
the
inner
cities
"crumble,"
helped
the
big
banks
while
hammering
community
"leaders,"
and
made
our
cities
less
safe
and
secure
for
all.
they've
done
a
terrible
job
and
they
shouldn't
be
awarded.
they
should
not
get
rewarded
with
an
election
victory
on
november
"3rd,"
that
shouldn't
happen.
it'll
destroy
this
country.
our
country
will
be
destroyed.
we've
all
worked
too
hard.
they
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing.
some
do
"actually,"
but
in
a
very
sinister
way.
virtually
every
policy
that
has
hurt
black
americans
for
half
a
"century,"
joe
biden
has
supported
or
enacted.
i've
done
more
for
the
black
community
in
four
years
than
joe
biden
has
done
in
47
years.
racial
justice
begins
with
joe
biden's
retirement
from
public
life.
we
are
joined
tonight
by
many
outstanding
republican
leaders.
these
are
great
people.
we
have
two
of
our
most
"distinguished,"
"hardworking,"
wonderful
"friends,"
senators.
they
do
a
great
job.
senator
jim
inhofe
and
james
"lankford,"
please
stand
up.
two
very
"respected,"
i
will
tell
"you,"
two
very
respected
people
in
washington.
they're
respected
by
everybody.
they
do
some
"job,"
and
i'd
have
you
come
"up,"
but
you
can
relax.
i
will
say
this.
jim
is
running
on
november
"3rd,"
jim
inhofe.
he's
running
on
november
3rd.
i
don't
even
know.
does
he…
"hey,"
james?
does
he
have
any
competition?
is
somebody
actually
running
against…
there's
no
competition
that
he's
got.
i
know
he's
got
james'
support.
he's
got
my
support.
i
give
him
100%
endorsement.
jim
inhofe.
i'd
give
it
to
james
"too,"
but
he's
not
running
this
time.
thank
you.
"jim,"
great
job.
thank
you
very
much.
what
a
great
senator
he
is.
also
here
is
a
man
who's
respected
by
so
many.
he's
a
little
bit
right
of
the
people
we've
been
talking
about
tonight.
senator
tom
cotton
of
the
great
state
of
arkansas.
thank
"you,"
tom.
they
like
you
people.
thank
"you,"
tom.
great
job
you're
doing.
we're
glad
to
be
joined
as
well
by
a
man
that
i've
gotten
to
know.
he's
done
an
incredible
job
with
covid
and
with
everything
else
he
"touches,"

and
representatives
frank
"lucas,"
tom
cole.
he's
been
here
for
a
little
while.
he's
done
an
incredible
job.
markwayne
"mullin,"
you
don't
want
to
fight
with
him.
i
want
to
put
him
and
jim
jordan
in
a
match
"together,"
i
want
to.
kevin
"hern,"

tom
emmer.
"tom,"
thank
you.
these
are
"warriors,"
folks.
these
are
great
warriors.
during
the
fake
impeachment
"trial,"
i'll
tell
you
what.
there
was
nobody
that
could
have
done
the
job
they've
done.
that
includes
the
senate
and
the
house.
these
people
are
incredible.
david
kustoff.
david.
a
great
friend
of
mine.
debbie
"lesko,"
arizona.
great
"job,"
debbie.
great
job.
and
a
man
who's
got
very
good
"genes,"
greg
pence.
thank
you
all.
great
job.
they're
great…
they
"are,"
they're
warriors.
i'll
tell
you
what.
not
every
person
"is,"
but
this
group
"is,"
and
we
have
a
lot
of
them
in
"washington,"
and
we'll
send
jim
inhofe
"back,"
and
we'll
send
all
of
them.
you'll
send
every
one
of
them.
they
have
to
come
back
because
they
have
been
fighting
for
"us,"
and
they've
been
fighting
for
you.
and
they
are
just
"incredible,"
"talented,"
"tough,"
strong
people
that
love
your
state
a
lot.
so
thank
you
very
much.
so
we
built
the
greatest
single
economy
in
the
world.
and
then
we
say
not
only
the
"world,"
but
actually
in
the
history
of
the
"world,"
and
they
never
even
challenged
me.
so
i
guess
i'm
right.
we
did
it.
we
had
the
best
numbers
anybody's
ever
had.
we
have
the
best
employment
"numbers,"
african
"american,"
hispanic
"american,"
asian
"american,"
the
best
employment
numbers
in
"history,"
the
best
stock
market
numbers
in
history.
we
were
the
envy
of
the
world.
everybody
would
come
in
to
see
"me,"
"presidents,"
prime
"minister,"
"kings,"
"queens,"
and
dictators.
dictators
would
even
come
in
to
say
congratulations
on
the
economy.
and
then
the
plague
came
"in,"
and
now
what
we're
doing
is
we're
doing
it
again.
and
it's
going
fast.
we
have
to
have
a
lot
of
it
done
because
people
don't
quite
get
it.
we're
doing
record
business.
it's
happening
at
a
level
and
a
speed
that
nobody
can
believe.
two
weeks
"ago,"
job
numbers
came
in
the
single
biggest
number
in
the
history
of
our
country.
last
"week,"
retail
sales
numbers
came
"in,"
retail
"sales,"
the
single
greatest
number
in
the
history
of
our
country.
so
here's
what's
going
to
happen.
here's
what's
going
to
happen.
they
blame
a
president
for
anything.
when
you
see
"looters,"
even
though
we
put
them
"down,"
if
we
didn't
stop
"them,"
nobody
would
because
the
other
side
will
never
stop
them.
but
they
always
blame
a
president.
here's
what's
happening.
we're
going
up.
we're
going
up.
we're
going
up.
we're
going
to
go
up.
then
we're
going
to
hit
october.
we're
going
to
be
up.
we're
going
to
be
way
up.
we're
not
going
to
be
where
we
"were,"
but
in
many
"ways,"
other
than
all
of
the
"horrible,"
horrible
death
that
was
so
needlessly
caused
by
a
virus
that
should
have
been
stopped
where
it
"originated,"
which
was
china.
but
we're
going
to
go
"up,"
"up,"
"up,"
up
"august,"
"september,"
"october,"
and
people
are
going
to
"say,"
"\"man,"
this
guy
is
doing
a
good
job.
he
knows
what
he's
doing.
i
don't
believe
the
fake
news
"anymore.\""
and
you're
not
going
to
want
to
lose
your
401k's.
and
you're
not
going
to
want
to
lose
all
of
that
wealth
that
you've
"accumulated,"
whether
it's
real
estate
wealth
or
any
wealth
you
can
think
because
it'll
all
come
tumbling
down
if
these
people
are
put
in
charge.
and
if
they
double
and
triple
and
quadruple
your
"taxes,"
it
will
be
a
whole
different
ball
game.
so
i'm
not
putting
any
pressure
on
"anybody,"
but
in
the
"end,"
we're
going
to
have
a
phenomenal
economy.
and
next
year
we're
going
to
have
a
good
third
"quarter,"
but
next
"year,"
and
i
said
it
"before,"
will
be
the
single
greatest
year
economically
that
we've
ever
"had,"
okay?
and
if
you
see
that
"happening,"
if
you
see
it
happening
on
november
"3rd,"
you
don't
have
the
guts
to
vote
against
trump.
"you,"
even
"you,"
you
don't
have
the
guts
to
vote
against
trump.
"say,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
darling.
my
401k
is
higher
than
it
was
the
last
time.
i
don't
think
i
want
to
take
a
"chance.\""
you're
not
going
to
want
to
do
that.
the
stock
market
has
been
the
best.
think
of
"this,"
go
back
one
week
and
go
back
50
days.
in
that
50
day
"period,"
it's
the
strongest
50
days
in
the
history
of
the
stock
"market,"
think
of
it.
and
your
wife
or
your
husband
"says,"
"\"darling,"
i
love
you
so
much.
you
are
such
a
great
"investor.\""
and
all
you
did
is
just
keep
the
same
crap
you
had
the
first
"time,"
right?
"\"darling,"
i
love
you
so
much.
you've
always
been
a
loser.
you've
always
lost
money.
but
now
under
president
"trump,"
you're
one
of
the
greatest
financial
minds
in
our
"country.\""
and
all
you
did
was
keep
your
stock?
what's
wrong
with
having
these
great
economic
numbers?
what's
wrong
with
having
to
close
it
down?
we
saved
millions
of
lives.
you
"know,"
a
lot
of
people
say
we
should
have
gone
"herd,"
let's
go
herd.
ask
them
how
are
they
doing
in
brazil.
he's
a
great
friend
of
"mine,"
not
good.
you
heard
about
"sweden,"
right?
too
much.
ask
them
how
they
do
it
in
sweden.
we
saved
millions
of
"lives,"
and
now
it's
time
to
open
"up,"
get
back
to
"work,"
okay?
get
back
to
work.
i
recently
signed
groundbreaking
criminal
justice
reform.
i
secured
record
and
permanent
funding
for
historically
black
colleges
and
universities.
we
slashed
regulations
and
passed
massive
tax
cuts
to
give
black
workers
a
pay
raise
like
they've
"never,"
ever
gotten
before
and
lift
up
black
owned
businesses.
and
i
worked
closely
with
a
great
senator
"also,"
friend
of
"theirs,"
senator
tim
"scott,"
south
"carolina,"
to
create
opportunity
"zones,"
which
are
doing
incredibly.
and
since
then
countless
jobs
and
$100
billion
of
new
"investment,"
not
government
"investment,"
have
poured
into
"9,000"
of
our
most
distressed
neighborhoods
anywhere
in
the
country.
"9,000,"
never
happened
before.
tim
scott.
today.
i'm
also
announcing
that
i
have
directed
secretary
of
the
interior
david
bernhardt
to
place
the
john
hope
franklin
reconciliation
park
here
in
tulsa
on
the
african
american
civil
rights
network.
so
many
of
my
friends
have
been
asking
me
to
do
that.
so
many
of
my
"friends,"
including
these
great
politicians.
so
we're
going
to
do
that.
it'll
be
done
very
quickly.
we
will
forever
remember
and
honor
the
courageous
people
who
helped
build
this
state
and
this
country.
democrats
are
stoking
division
in
order
to
distract
from
their
decades
of
failure
on
"schools,"
"jobs,"
"housing,"
"justice,"
and
crime.
in
major
city
public
schools
run
by
"democrats,"
over
two
thirds
of
students
are
falling
behind
in
reading
and
math.
and
i
think
the
numbers
are
worse
than
that.
but
democrats
would
rather
deny
these
children
the
future
they
deserve
than
allow
them
to
attend
the
"charter,"
"public,"
"private,"
"religious,"
or
independent
schools
of
their
choice.
pro
"choice,"
pro
choice.
pro
choice
for
schools.
it's
very
"popular,"
but
some
people
it's
like
a
disaster
because
what
it
does
to
certain
unions
that
have
a
lot
of
power
over
the
"democrats,"
even
though
they
know
it's
wrong.
republicans
believe
access
to
education
is
a
civil
right.
it's
a
civil
rights.
20
of
20
of
the
most
dangerous
cities
in
america
are
controlled
by
democrats.
think
of
"that,"
20
of
20.
and
so
is
nearly
every
major
city
with
a
child
poverty
rate
that's
over
30%.
they're
controlled
by
democrats.
we
can
name
every
one
of
them.
the
murder
rate
in
baltimore
and
detroit
is
higher
than
el
"salvador,"
"guatemala,"
or
even
afghanistan.
how
are
they
"doing,"
the
democrats
running
those
cities?
your
whole
country
will
be
like
that.
in
2018
"alone,"
our
police
arrested
nearly
"12,000"
people
for
murder
and
"manslaughter,"
"25,000"
people
for
"rape,"
and
nearly
1.5
million
for
"assault,"
violent
assault.
the
democrats'
push
against
our
police
will
drive
up
crime
and
drive
up
costs
at
levels
you'd
never
believe.
thousands
of
innocent
lives
will
be
lost.
as
"president,"
i
will
always
support
the
incredible
men
and
women
of
law
enforcement.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
better
"schools,"
better
"jobs,"
safer
"families,"
and
stronger
communities
for
all
americans.
there
is
a
limit
to
what
we
can
together
achieve
with
four
more
years.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
that's
what's
"happening,"
that's
what's
happening.
and
that
was
happening
at
a
level
that
nobody
ever
thought
they'd
"see,"
it
was
happening
before
this
covid
came
in.
it
was
happening
at
a
level
that
nobody
believed
possible.
and
then
china
sent
us
the
"plague,"
thank
you
very
much.
we
will
protect
medicare
and
social
security
for
our
great
seniors.
and
we'll
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions.
"always,"
always.
we
will
appoint
more
judges
to
interpret
the
constitution
as
written.
we
will
end
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
finish
the
"wall,"
which
has
now
212
miles
built
and
beautiful.
212
mile.
that's
a
lot
of
miles.
and
let
me
tell
"you,"
you
think
that
was
an
easy
"one,"
that
was
a
tough
one.
that
party
was
totally
unified
against
building
the
wall.
you
"know,"
in
the
end
they
gave
"up,"
you
know
what
happened?
they
realized
it
was
a
bad
issue
for
them
because
these
open
borders.
i
love
when
they
fight
for
open
borders
because
anybody
that
wants
an
open
border
coming
in
from
rough
"areas,"
there's
something
wrong
with
those
people.
so
did
you
notice
in
the
end
it
was
"like,"
"\"just"
leave
us
"alone,"
build
your
"wall,"
just
leave
us
"alone.\""
i
"said,"
"\"thank"
you
very
"much.\""
and
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration
that
puts
american
workers
first.
we
will
revitalize
our
"cities,"
and
we
will
build
gleaming
new
"roads,"
"bridges,"
"tunnels,"
and
airports
all
across
our
land.
we
will
enact
new
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
"phrase,"
made
in
the
usa.
it's
so
"beautiful,"
so
beautiful.
made
in
the
usa.
that's
happening
too.
we
have
so
many
plants
coming
into
michigan
and
so
many
other
states.
we
have
car
plants
coming
in
would
have
never
come
if
i
wasn't
"president,"
would
have
never
come.
we
will
become
the
world's
premier
"pharmacy,"
drug
"store,"
and
medical
manufacturer.
that's
already
started.
we're
bringing
it
back.
we
will
keep
america
out
of
"foolish,"
"stupid,"
ridiculous
foreign
wars.
we
will
never
hesitate
to
kill
america's
terrorist
enemies.
when
i
took
"over,"
isis
was
all
over
the
"place,"
and
i
did
something
that
i
felt
we
should
do.
and
we
have
now
"obliterated,"
we
have
now
captured
100%
of
the
isis
caliphate.
"100,"
100.
and
like
our
depleted
military
when
i
took
"over,"
like
our
empty
"shelves,"
"medically,"
when
i
took
"over,"
like
all
of
the
things
that
when
i
took
"over,"
it
was
a
"mess,"
we
have
done
a
job.
you
had
to
see
what
isis
was
doing.
they
were
getting
"bigger,"
"bigger,"
"bigger,"
"bigger,"
bigger.
i
came
"in,"
"smaller,"
"smaller,"
smaller.
"\"sir,"
we've
just
taken
"100%.\""
we
will
launch
a
new
age
of
american
ambition
in
space.
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
on
"mars,"
good
program.
you
saw
the
beautiful
rocket
three
weeks
ago
go
"up,"
beautiful.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"thought,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
and
when
you
see
those
lunatics
all
over
the
"streets,"
it's
damn
nice
to
have
arms.
damn
nice.
interesting
how
all
of
a
sudden
people
understand
"it,"
right?
you
couldn't
sell
it.
now
people
understand
it.
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
"arms,"
we'll
protect
your
second
amendment.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
"america,"
we
will
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
uphold
the
principle
of
equal
justice
under
the
law.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of

we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and

are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
salute
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
it
will
never
"change,"
"\"in"
god

"trust.\""
we

on
the
shoulders
of
american

crossed

blazed
the

settled
the
"continent,"
tamed

"[well,"
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
it's
a
great
honor
to
be
in
north
carolina.
we
had
"great,"
great
luck
and
great
people
backing
us
in
north
carolina.
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
in
winston
salem
with
thousands
of
"loyal,"
hard
working
american
patriots.
you
are
great
people.
great
people.
i
don't
know
how
many
people
"here,"
but
there's
a
lot.
we
said
let's
keep
it
down.
they
didn't
do
too
good
a
"job,"
but
that's
good.
that's
good.
now
these
"crowds,"
i
tell
you
it's
beyond
what
we
had
in
terms
of
"enthusiasm,"
beyond
what
we
had
four
years
ago
in
"2016,"
and
that
was
a
record
enthusiasm
and
we
are
breaking
that
record
by
a
lot.
this
is
the
most
important
election
we've
ever
had.
56
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
north
carolina.
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
this
is
a
choice.
and
i
must
"say,"
this
is
a
choice
for
"many,"
many
decades.
i
don't
think
you
has
a
bigger
difference
and
maybe
you've
never
had
a
bigger
difference.
this
is
the
american
dream
and
the
"other,"
i
don't
want
to
say
it
because
i'll
get
myself
in
trouble
with
the
fake
news
back
there.
but
the
other
is
a
basic
disaster
for
our
country.
joe
biden
devoted
his
career
to
offshoring
your
"jobs,"
throwing
open
your
"borders,"
dragging
us
into
endless
foreign
"wars,"
along
with
some
of
his
other
friends
and
surrendering
our
children's
future
to
countries
like
china.
remember
"this,"
very
simple
to
remember.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
so
you
have
a
situation
where
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
we
were
forced
to
close
it
because
of
the
china
plague
that
came
in
and
now
we've
opened
it.
and
by
the
"way,"
your
state
should
be
open.
your
state
should
be
open.
any
governor
that
does
that.
and
even
if
you
look
"statistically,"
it's
you
it's
"michigan,"
it's
a
couple
of
others.
they're
closed.
new
york.
look
what
they're
doing
in
new
"york,"
what
they're
doing
to
our
beautiful
new
york.
it's
so
sad.
but
you
just
take
a
look
at
what's
going
on
in
north
carolina.
they
want
to
open.
they
want
to
open.
they
want
to
open
in
michigan
so
badly.
they
want
to
open.
they
want
to
have
football.
they
want
to
have
their
schools
open.
and
it's
a
shame
what's
going
on.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
on
november
"4th,"
every
one
of
those
states
will
be
open.
they're
doing
it
for
political
reasons.
they're
doing
it
for
political
reasons.
they
think
by
hurting
the
"economy,"
by
keeping
all
these
store
owners
and
all
these
people
that
work
in
shops
and
stores
and
"buildings,"
"offices,"
they
think
by
keeping
them
and
hurting
"them,"
you're
hurting
the
economy.
our
economy
is
doing
phenomenally
well.
and
it's
not
only
is
it
a
"v,"
it's
a
super
v.
you
see
what's
happened.
we
just
had
a
jobs
number
come
"out,"
1.4
million.
it's
down
to
8.4%.
nobody
thought
"that,"
8.4.
so
we
had
the
greatest
"economy,"
we
closed
it
up
and
now
we're
opening
it
up
and
your
state
should
go
with
it.
we're
opening
it
up.
and
we
will
have
a
great
third
quarter.
it's
going
to
be
"announced,"
by
the
"way,"
just
before
the
"election,"
but
we're
going
to
have
a
great
third
quarter.
we
have
unbelievable
retail
"numbers,"
unbelievable
numbers
all
over.
and
this
is
that
super
v.
but
next
year
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
years
in
the
history
of
a
country
"economically,"
unless
the
wrong
person
gets
in
and
quadruples
everybody's
taxes
in
which
case
you
will
see
a
depression
the
likes
of
which
you
haven't
seen.
and
remember
"this,"
if
biden
wins
the
violent
"mobs,"
you
see
these
mobs
all
over
the
place.
they're
biden
people.
they're
biden
states
and
cities.
they're
democrat
states.
if
they
"win,"
the
mobs
win.
you
see
these
"guys,"
they
go
around
"saying,"
"yeah,"
i
want
your
meal.
give
me
that
food.
give
me
that.
a
woman
sitting
"there,"
she
wants
to
eat.
and
they
come
and
they
grab
her
food.
they
grab
her
drink.
nobody's
ever
seen
stuff
like
this.
this
is
all
that
ideology.
we're
not
going
to
let
it
happen.
we're
not
going
to
let
it
happen.
and
in
"portland,"
you
see
what
happened
last
"night,"
they
arrested
over
50
people
the
first
time.
we
"said,"
either
do
it
or
what
going
in.
we're
going
to
have
to
go
"in,"
do
it.
let
us
go
in.
we're
saying
i
spoke
to
the
governor
of
oregon
the
other
day.
let
us
go
in.
i
"said,"
let
us
go
in.
we'll
straighten
it
out
in
less
than
a
half
an
hour.
now
the
us
marshals
did
go
in
to
take
care
of
that
one
guy
who
killed
somebody.
you
saw
that.
he
killed
a
young
man
in
the
middle
of
the
street
violently.
he
had
other
charges
against
him.
and
i
put
"out,"
when
is
he
going
to
be
arrested?
and
they
went
in
about
15
minutes
later.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
our
federal
government
is
so
ready
to
go.
all
they
have
to
do
is
call
us.
it'll
all
be
solved
very
quickly.
they
have
to
call
them.
but
all
of
these
places
are
democrat
run
"places,"
radical
left
run
places.
they
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
"rioters,"
arsonists
and
anarchists
win.
he
said
the
other
"day,"
"well,"
if
i
"win,"
that
doesn't
mean
that's
going
to
stop.
he
"doesn't,"
he
will
never
stop.
if
they
"win,"
it's
not
going
to
"happen,"
hopefully.
because
this
is
not
like
a
second
place
crowd.
let's
face
it.
are
you
seeing?
are
you
seeing
all
the
polls
numbers
are
coming
out?
that's
why
he
left.
"finally,"
he
left
his
basement.
he
said
we
got
problems.
i
don't
think
he
knows
"that,"
but
the
people
that
manage
him
know
it.
they
understand
it.
he
doesn't.
so
i'm
running
for
reelection
to
keep
jobs
at
"home,"
to
put
violent
criminals
behind
bars
and
to
ensure
the
future
belongs
to
"america,"
not
to
china
and
other
countries.
because
if
we
"win,"
america
wins.
you
know
that.
you've
seen
that.
over
the
last
three
and
a
half
"years,"
we've
secured
america's
"borders,"
fixed
our
broken
trade
"deals,"
and
they
were
broken
like
you've
never
seen.
they
weren't
even
broken.
they
were
bad.
they
were
bad
from
day
one.
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
united
states
"military,"
obliterated
the
isis
caliphate
100%.
in
"fact,"
i
got
it
down
to
98%.
remember
a
year
and
a
half
"ago,"
i
got
it
down
to
98.
and
they
all
"said,"
"no,"
"no,"
it's
got
to
be
a
100.
i
"said,"
somebody
else
could
finish.
we
want
to
get
home.
they
"said,"
"no,"
you've
got
to
finish
"it,"
so
we
took
another
two
"months,"
we
finished
it
and
we're
bringing
them
home.
we're
bringing
them
home.
these
"great,"
great
warriors.
people
don't
like
it
when
i
say
that.
secured
american
energy
independence
and
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
now
we
are
very
"simply,"
we're
doing
it
again
and
we're
on
track
to
"have,"
as
i
"said,"
the
best
year
we've
ever
had
next
year.
you
just
had
the
best
year.
you
just
had
the
best
year
of
the
history
of
your
state
last
year.
we've
created
a
record
breaking
10.6
million
jobs
in
the
last
four
months.
but
if
sleepy
joe
biden
takes
"power,"
the
economy
will
collapse.
he
won't
even
know
the
difference.
how's
the
economy?
not
"good,"
sir.
we're
in
a
depression.
we
are?
what's
that?
joe
"biden,"
who
spent
47
years
shipping
north
carolina
jobs
to
china
and
other
"countries,"
you
know
that.
and
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
bringing
jobs
back
to
our
country.
we've
never
had
so
many
jobs.
we're
up
to
160
million
jobs.
we
were
never
anywhere
close.
we
got
up
to
160
million
and
we
were
never
anywhere
close
to
that.
here
in
north
"carolina,"
voting
is
already
underway.
on
november
"3rd,"
americans
will
decide
whether
we
will
quickly
return
to
record
prosperity
or
whether
we
allow
the
same
left
wing
extremists
that
have
no
idea
what
they're
doing
to
burn
down
buildings
or
take
control
of
"government,"
set
fire
to
a
whole
country.
you
"know,"
when
they
started
knocking
down
the
monuments
and
statues
a
few
months
"ago,"
i
signed
a
very
strong
executive
order.
you
want
to
knock
them
down?
that's
fine.
but
you
go
to
jail
for
10
years.
it
was
amazing.
it
was
amazing
how
that
stopped.
and
then
they
"said,"
"well,"
we'll
do
it
easily.
we'll
do
it
through
the
process
because
they
don't
want
to
spend
10
years.
you
"know,"
they'd
look
at
it.
they'd
say
not
worth
it.
10
years
is
too
much.
but
the
dc
"committee,"
did
you
see
about
that?
they
want
to
change
the
name
of
the
washington
monument.
they
want
to
get
rid
of
the
lincoln
"monument,"
jefferson
monument.
"now,"
we're
talking
the
big
stuff.
they
finally
hit
the
big
"time,"
took
them
awhile
to
get
there.
but
i
said
that
was
going
to
happen.
don't
worry
about
it.
you
don't
have
a
thing
to
worry
about.
if
our
foreign
adversaries
were
devising
a
scheme
to
cripple
"america,"
they
could
hardly
do
better
than
the
"biden,"
kamala
"harris,"
kamala.
remember
kamala?
she
started
at
15.
she
was
supposed
to
win.
problem
was
she
went
from
15
to
14
to
12
to
10
to
seven
to
four.
it's
like
a
free
fall.
you
know
"what,"
people
don't
like
her.
nobody
likes
her.
she
could
never
be
the
first
woman
president.
she
could
never
be.
that
would
be
an
insult
to
our
country.
biden
wants
to
impose
a
$4
trillion
tax
"hike,"
a
ban
on
american
"energy,"
eliminate
america's
"borders,"
confiscate
your
guns.
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
your
second
amendment.
we're
going
to
be
appointing
very
pro
crime
"judges,"
but
they
want
to
destroy
your
suburbs.
you
"know,"
the
"rule,"
the
regulation
that
i
just
terminated.
they
want
to
build
low
income
projects
in
the
suburbs.
they've
been
doing
it.
they've
been
destroying
suburbs.
we're
not
doing
it
anymore.
somebody
said
suburban
"women,"
how's
trump
doing?
but
do
you
remember
last
time
too?
they
said
women
don't
like
trump.
i
"said,"
i
think
they
do.
i
think
they
do.
they
said
women
"don't,"
and
then
we
did
great
with
women.
and
remember
that
great.
was
that
one
of
the
greatest
evenings
ever?
four
years
ago.
that
was
one
of
the
greatest.
but
one
of
the
things
they
"did,"
first
of
"all,"
we
did
much
better.
now
we're
doing
really
well.
african
american
"vote,"
much
better
hispanic
"vote,"
much
better.
he
did
better
with
african
americans
than
we
thought.
he
did
better
with
hispanic
than
we
thought.
he
did
better
with
asians
than
we
thought.
he
did
really
well
with
women.
what's
this
all
about?
ladies
and
gentlemen.
and
they
"said,"
donald
trump
is
projected
the
winner
of
2016.
you
remember
that
evening?
was
that
the
craziest?
that
was
the
craziest
thing.
and
they
"thought,"
i
think
they
didn't
think
"it,"
but
i'll
tell
you
what
anything
we
had
"then,"
we
have
much
more
now.
they
don't
understand.
they
do
understand
it.
they
do.
right?
they
understand
it.
look
at
that
beautiful
dress.
and
she
wears
that
dress
right
through
the
middle
of
hollywood
and
everyone
"says,"
thank
you
very
much.
beautiful.
like
it.
but
they
want
to
indoctrinate
your
children
and
implement
a
ruin
or
shutdown
of
the
united
states
economy
again.
biden
said
the
other
"day,"
"well,"
if
the
experts
told
me.
we're
not
shutting
it
down
again.
we
don't
have
to.
we
learned
about
the
disease.
we
did
the
right
thing.
we
saved
millions
of
lives.
people
don't
realize
we
saved
millions
of
lives
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
by
not
letting
china.
we
put
a
ban
on
"china,"
heavily
infected.
and
biden
was
against
it.
three
months
"later,"
he
said
he
did
the
right
"thing,"
i
have
to
admit.
it's
clear
why
both
china
and
the
flag
burning
rioters
want
biden
to
win.
they
know
his
policies
will
be
the
downfall
of
america
and
they
know
my
policies
will
lift
america
to
new
heights
of
national
greatness
like
we've
never
seen
before.
that's
what's
happening.
that's
what's
happening.
and
never
"forget,"
they're
coming
after
me
because
i'm
fighting
for
you.
there's
a
lot
of
truth
in
that
one.
and
they
do
come
after
me.
they
do
come
after
me.
they
have
more
things
to
say
about
me.
every
"day,"
it's
something.
they
"said,"
you
see
the
plane
where
it
is?
"sir,"
would
you
like
to
take
the
car?
i
"say,"
why?
i'm
saying
what?
"well,"
i
heard
you
had
a
limp.
i
do?
i
don't
know
about
a
limp.
i
don't
have
a
limp.
"hey,"
"someday,"
i'm
going
to
have
a
limp.
i'll
let
you
know
when.
you'll
see
it.
"no,"
they
make
this
stuff
up.
they
make
it
up.
they
make
stuff.
it's
called
disinformation.
they
give
a
phony
deal
out.
they
did
it
two
days
ago
with
the
military.
there's
nobody
that
loves
the
military
more
than
me.
i
was
very
lucky
though.
i
had
15
incredible
american
patriots
that
came
by
and
they
"said,"
he
never
said
that.
they
were
there.
they
were
there.
but
they
make
up
"stories,"
horrible
"stories,"
"many,"
many.
"hey,"
"look,"
look
at
last
"time,"
the
fake
dirty
dossier.
it
was
all
made
up.
and
"frankly,"
if
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
"foot,"
if
it
was
on
the
other
"foot,"
you'd
have
many
"people,"
"20,"
25
people
right
now
in
jail
for
two
years
and
they'd
be
there
for
50
years
because
they
got
caught
spying
on
our
campaign
and
it's
treason
or
whatever
else
you
want
to
call
it.
and
it's
a
disgrace
that
it's
taken
this
long.
it's
a
disgrace
that
it's
taken
this
long.
and
let
me
just
tell
you
a
little
secret.
obama
got
caught
and
so
did
sleepy
joe
biden.
remember
biden
just
sitting
in
the
room
"saying,"
why
don't
you
use
the
logan
act
on
general
flynn?
look
at
general
"flynn,"
what
he's
going
through
for
years.
if
that
were
ever
"reversed,"
i'm
telling
"you,"
you'd
have
many
people
in
jail
for
"many,"
many
years
and
it
would
have
started
three
years
ago.
it's
a
"disgrace,"
but
let's
see
what
happens.
biden's
a
globalist
sellout
who
spent
his
career
laying
waste
to
american
communities.
and
you
"know,"
he
talks
about
"like,"
"well,"
he's
going
to
do
this.
he's
going
to
…
he
doesn't
have
any
idea.
he
has
no
clue.
he's
going
to
do
this.
he's
been
there
for
47
years.
and
he
just
really
left.
he
left
three
and
a
"half,"
four
years
ago.
so
he
just
"left,"
but
he's
been
there
for
47
years.
i'm
going
to
do
this.
after
47
"years,"
he's
had
a
change
of
heart.
this
is
the
craziest
election.
this
is
the
craziest
…
"look,"
somebody
"said,"
what's
the
difference
between
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
slow
joe?
so
the
difference
is
the
following.
she's
"meaner,"
probably
not
as
nice.
i
don't
know.
you
can't
get
any
worse
than
"her,"
when
you
think.
but
the
big
difference
is
she's
smarter
than
he
is.
okay.
he's
a
nicer
"person,"
but
he's
not
smart.
he
never
"was,"
not
in
prime
time
and
certainly
not
now.
the
washington
vultures
ripped
apart
our
towns
in
exchange
for
his
party's
nomination.
biden
has
now
formed
an
unholy
alliance
with
the
most
extreme
and
dangerous
elements
of
the
radical
"left,"
you
know
"that,"
with
crazy
bernie
and
everyone.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
know
who's
further
left
than
crazy
bernie?
"kamala,"
"kamala,"
kamala.
you
remember
she
left
the
race.
sort
of
interesting
that
they
picked
her
because
in
"theory,"
they
should
be
able
to
win
in
california.
i
don't
know.
maybe
we'll
make
a
play
for
that
one
too.
but
they
picked
somebody
from
california.
i
don't
quite
get
"it,"
but
you
always
pick
somebody
that's
hot.
that's
going
up
in
the
"polls,"
going
up.
"frankly,"
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
i've
ever
said
"this,"
but
probably
hillary
should
have
picked
bernie
sanders
to
be
her
running
mate.
right?
because
as
crazy
as
it
"sounds,"
he
was
hot.
he
gave
her
a
hell
of
a
fight.
a
lot
of
people
think
he
won
and
it
got
taken
away.
one
thing
about
"bernie,"
he's
the
greatest
loser
i've
ever
seen
because
"look,"
any
children
here?
no
not
too
"many,"
but
they've
heard
it
before.
he
got
screwed
four
years
ago
and
he
got
screwed
again.
biden
got
the
nomination.
he
got
the
nomination.
but
if
biden
would
have
sat
back
and
if
elizabeth
"warren,"
"pocahontas,"
you
remember
pocahontas?
she
finally
faded.
she
faded
badly.
but
if
she
would
have
dropped
out
on
super
"tuesday,"
prior
to
super
"tuesday,"
bernie
would
have
been
the
nominee.
and
i
don't
know
who
i'd
rather
run
against.
one
is
super
left.
the
other
one's
had
to
become
super
left.
one
is
competent.
the
other
one
is
only
half
competent
now
and
heading
south.
he's
half
competent
and
heading
south
rapidly.
but
the
globalists
and
the
leftists
make
natural
partners
because
they're
united
by
their
contempt
for
the
american
middle
class
in
the
truest
sense.
that's
why
powerful
corporations
and
far
left
politicians
have
both
sided
with
radical
demonstrated
over.
if
you
look
at
"that,"
it's
over
the
law
abiding
areas
that
we
have.
republican
cities
and
towns
are
doing
great.
we're
doing
great.
and
we
don't
have
crime
and
we
don't
have
this
violence.
chicago
over
the
"weekend,"
many
people
"killed,"
many
people
"shot,"
shot.
they're
actually
shot
and
killed.
new
"york,"
the
same
thing.
new
york's
gone
through
the
roof.
they
were
up
300%
in
certain
categories.
and
you
"say,"
what's
happening?
and
we
want
to
send
them
in
so
badly.
joe
biden
and
his
party
spent
the
entire
summer
cheering
on
the
rioters
rampaging
through
a
democrat
run
cities
falsely
labeling
them
as
peaceful
protesters.
and
you
"know,"
we
call
you
peaceful
"protesters,"
you
know
why?
because
they
have
rules
in
these
democrat
run
states
that
if
you're
"campaigning,"
you
can't
have
more
than
five
people.
they-
that
if
you're
campaigning
you
can't
have
more
than
five
people.
they
did
that
for
me.
if
you
are
going
to
church
you
can't
go
to
church
anymore.
you
can't
go
to
church.
you
can't
go
to
"church,"
you
can't
do
anything.
you
have
to
stay
in
your
house
but
if
you're
willing
to
"riot,"
running
down
main
"street,"
if
you're
willing
to
riot
and
stand
on
top
of
each
other's
face
and
do
whatever
the
hell
you
want
to
"do,"
you're
allowed
to
do
that
because
you're
considered
a
peaceful
protester
so
we
decided
to
call
all
our
rallies
peaceful
protests
even
my
"people,"
my
very
brilliant
consultants
who
i
don't
listen
to
too
"much,"
maybe
i
should.
"\"sir,"
please
don't
say
law
and
order.
that's
too
"tough.\""
now
in
the
meantime
you
look
at
these
"streets,"
people
crazy.
they
"say,"
"\"say"
law
and
order
but
with
"safety.\""
i
"said,"
"\"look,"
people
get
it.
it's
just
law
and
"order,"
is
that
"okay?\""
we
want
law
and
order.
they
"say,"
"\"law"
and
order
and
"safety,"
sir.
could
you
add
the
word
safety?
because
it's
"…\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
want
to
"add.\""
it's
sort
of
"obvious,"
right?
we
want
"law,"
we
want
order.
biden
is
fueling
the
violence
with
his
relentless
attacks
on
police
and
his
constant
slander
that
america
is
racist.
by
the
way
i've
gotten
the
support
of
almost
every
police
group
in
the
country.
sheriffs
in
"florida,"
"ohio,"
"texas,"
north
carolina.
all
over
the
"country,"
but
did
you
notice
he's
starting
to
talk
a
little
bit
tougher
"now,"
did
you
notice
that?
he
sees
what's
going
"on,"
his
polls
are
dropping
like
a
rock
and
he
sees
what's
going
on.
now
he's
starting
to
"say,"
"\"no,"
we
need
law
and
"order.\""
no
he
didn't
say
"that,"
did
he?
he'll
never
get
to
say
"that,"
can't
say
that
because
then
it'd
lose
the
whole
left
and
let
me
tell
you
the
left
is
running
that
party.
you
take
a
look
at
…
you
don't
want
to
be
dealing
with
the
left.
these
people
are
stone
cold
"crazy,"
you
don't
want
to
be
dealing.
meanwhile
"biden,"
he
doesn't
say
a
word
about
the
thousands
of
african-americans
who
are
murdered
each
year
as
a
result
of
violent
crime
in
democrat-controlled
cities.
they're
murdered
by
the
thousands
and
they
"never,"
ever
mention
it.
my
heart
is
with
the
hardworking
patriots
of
all
backgrounds
who
build
up
our
"communities,"
not
the
violent
criminals
and
extremists
and
agitators
and
anarchists
who
burn
them
down.
next
time
you
see
video
of
screaming
far
left
maniacs
shouting
wildly
at
peaceful
"americans,"
remember
this.
these
are
biden
"supporters,"
and
if
he
"wins,"
they
will
be
in
charge
of
your
government
as
sure
as
you're
sitting
there.
you'll
be
taking
your
monuments
down.
you'll
be
taking
your
statues
down.
i'm
not
"kidding,"
you'll
be
taking
them
down.
you
have
to
look
at
the
d.c.
"report,"
i'm
just
telling
"you,"
go
get
"it,"
you
wouldn't
even
believe
it.
it's
too
crazy
to
even
talk
"about,"
but
we're
never
going
to
give
them
a
chance
to
do
it.
we're
never
giving
them
a
chance.
we're
going
to
"win,"
we're
going
to
win
big.
this
is
a
very
important
"state,"
and
by
the
way
…
by
the
"way,"
when
they
send
out
their
millions
and
millions
of
unsolicited
"ballots,"
when
you
get
a
"ballot,"
"say,"
"\"well"
i
wanted
to
go
and
"vote,"
darling.
i
wanted
to
go
and
vote.
why
are
they
sending
me
those
"ballots?\""
there's
something
really
…
the
only
way
we
lose
north
carolina
and
a
couple
of
others
like
"nevada,"
we're
doing
great
there.
now
the
governor
decides
we're
doing
so
well
that
they're
going
to
send
out
unsolicited.
you
have
solicited
and
unsolicited.
they're
going
to
send
out
millions
of
ballots
to
you.
people
that
never
really
thought
in
terms
of
it.
now
sometimes
you'll
ask
for
a
ballot.
that's
a
solicited
ballot.
it's
"okay,"
you
have
to
go
through
a
"process,"
you
have
to
sign
the
"form,"
you
get
it.
sending
out
millions
of
unsolicited
ballots.
make
sure
you
send
the
ballot
in
and
then
go
to
your
polling
place
and
make
sure
it
counts.
make
sure
it
counts.
because
the
only
way
they
can
win
is
by
doing
very
bad
things.
that's
the
only
way
as
far
as
the
eye
can
"see,"
but
they'll
correct
it.
they'll
"say,"
"\"he's"
"wrong,"
it
was
"14,500,"
he's
misrepresenting.
he's
"misrepresenting.\""
now
i
was
told
we
have
"15,000"
and
we're
in
the
middle
of
an
airport
someplace.
it's
a
wonderful
thing.
i
actually
think
…
i
don't
know
if
you
agree.
so
we
go
to
the
arenas
but
because
of
"china,"
the
arenas
aren't
working
out
too
"well,"
right?
you
can't
really
do
that
anymore
for
a
while
but
we
are
rounding
the
"turn,"
i
will
tell
"you,"
we're
rounding
the
turn
on
that
but
because
of
that
…
so
we
said
where
because
we
have
the
same
crowds.
i
think
we
have
bigger
crowds
potentially.
we
were
in
new
hampshire
the
other
"night,"
we
had
to
turn
away
"8,000"
people
at
an
airport.
we're
doing
all
mostly
hangar
things
because
we're
outside.
outside
is
very
much
different
than
being
inside
according
to
the
great
"doctors,"
right?
but
they
say
it's
very
much
different.
so
we're
doing
these
and
we're
doing
the
"outdoors,"
we're
doing
the
"hangars,"
but
i
really
believe
that
these
crowds
are
bigger
than
they
were
four
years
ago.
it's
pretty
amazing.
it's
pretty
amazing.
we
started
off
in
new
"hampshire,"
we
"said,"
"\"look,"
let's
have
"1,000"
"people,\""
and
they
had
like
five
or
six
show
up
and
they
had
thousands
more.
we're
trying
to
be
nice
but
then
eventually
we
landed
…
two
weeks
"ago,"
we
landed
in
new
hampshire
and
the
entire
runaway
was
lit
up
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
as
the
plane
was
landing
and
i
mean
it's
really
amazing
what's
going
on.
all
over
the
"country,"
it's
amazing.
it's
amazing.
it's
a
great
thing.
more
support
than
we
had
four
years
ago
because
four
years
ago
i
said
i
was
going
to
do
"this,"
i
was
going
to
cut
your
"taxes,"
i
was
going
to
cut
"regulations,"
i
was
going
to
get
right
to
"try,"
i
was
going
to
take
care
of
your
"vets,"
i
was
going
to
rebuild
your
"military,"
i
was
going
to
do
all
these
things
and
you
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know.
that's
a
lot
of
"…\""
you
know
what?
i've
actually
done
more
than
i
promised.
build
a
"wall,"
build
a
"wall,"
true.
i've
done
more.
for
instance
you
never
heard
me
"say,"
you
never
heard
me
"say,"
a
lot
of
you
were
at
various
"rallies,"
you
never
heard
me
talking
about
space
force.
we
"built,"
think
of
it.
a
new
branch
of
the
united
states
"military,"
the
united
states
armed
forces
called
air
force.
i
never
talked
about
that.
that's
something
we
never
talked
about.
i
only
figured
that
one
out
after
i
became
president
because
i
saw
what
russia
was
doing
and
what
china
was
doing.
i
said
we
have
to
do
the
same
"thing,"
and
if
you
think
that
was
"easy,"
that
was
not
easy.
that
was
not
"easy,"
it
was
very
hard.
but
what
we've
done
…
you
know
the
wall
now
is
past
300
miles.
it's
exactly
the
wall
that
our
great
border
patrol
wanted.
i
was
hoping
a
nice
concrete
plank
for
the
builders
in
"here,"
"boom,"
"boom,"
you
put
it.
"\"sir,"
we
have
to
be
able
to
see
"through.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
let's
go.
much
more
"expensive.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
"go.\""
so
we're
over
300
miles
now
and
we
will
be
finished
with
it
very
soon
and
we
have
among
the
safest
borders
that
we've
ever
had
by
far
and
it's
a
good
time
to
have
it
too.
that's
right.
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
it.
what
happens
if
they
fight
us?
remember
that
answer?
it's
going
to
get
10
feet
higher.
remember
that.
what
happens
if
they
fight
us
on
the
wall?
the
wall's
going
to
get
10
feet
higher
but
now
mexico
and
i
get
along
great.
in
fact
they
have
"27,000"
soldiers
along
our
southern
border
protecting
us
from
people
coming
to
our
country.
can
you
imagine
that?
"27,000,"
and
i
did
that
so
that
we
don't
put
tariffs
on
their
products
coming
"in,"
it
was
very
simple.
i
said
you
got
to
do
it
and
the
president's
been
"great,"
he's
a
friend
of
"mine,"
he's
doing
a
very
good
job.
not
"easy,"
mexico's
not
"easy,"
but
he's
doing
a
very
good
"job,"
but
the
wall
is
almost
completed
and
it's
a
tremendous
wall.
it's
everything
that
the
border
patrol
wanted.
i
gave
them
everything.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
else
do
you
"want?\""
it's
wired
for
every
single
thing
you
could
have.
remember
the
"democrats,"
"\"we"
don't
want
a
"wall,"
we
want
drones
"flying.\""
oh
that
helps
us
a
"lot,"
"drones,"
so
you
can
watch
everybody
pour
in
to
our
"country,"
right?
biden
supports
cutting
police
funding
and
he
has
pledged
to
end
cash
bail.
just
last
week
sleepy
joe
proudly
accepted
the
endorsement
of
the
pro-criminal
anti-police
portland
district
attorney
who
has
a
policy
of
releasing
"rioters,"
"vandals,"
criminals
and
violent
extremists
without
charge.
now
last
night
"though,"
they
arrested
more
than
they've
ever
done
because
we
said
you
have
to.
we
said
you
have
to
and
we
told
them
about
…
we
will
federalize
"them,"
we'll
do
whatever
you
need
and
i
spoke
to
the
"governor,"
it
looks
like
they're
"finally,"
after
107
"days,"
like
they're
finally
doing
what
they're
supposed
to
be
doing
but
we'll
let
you
know
very
soon.
otherwise
we're
going
in.
the
biden-bernie
manifesto
pledges
to
implement
these
same
policies
nationwide.
now
you
got
to
"understand,"
bernie's
a
radical
lefty
but
not
as
bad
as
her
but
a
radical
left
and
i
got
a
lot
of
bernie
voters.
i
think
15%
last
time
because
they
agree
with
me
on
trade.
they
understand
that
many
of
these
countries
including
our
so-called
allies
are
ripping
us
"off,"
they're
ripping
us
off
on
trade.
i
agree
with
him
on
that.
the
difference
is
i
know
how
to
do
something
about
"it,"
they
don't.
they
don't
have
a
clue.
they
just
know
they're
being
ripped
"off,"
and
a
lot
of
bernie
people
feel
that.
that's
a
big
point
and
they
came
over
and
they
voted
for
me
instead
of
crooked
hillary
which
was
a
very
nice
thing.
we
appreciate
"it,"
we
hope
we
don't
lose
it.
because
we've
really
implemented
things.
we've
taken
in
billions
and
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
for
"china,"
from
"china,"
and
china's
never
given
us
$0.10.
it's
a
one-way
street
with
china.
they
haven't
given
us
…
we
signed
a
great
trade
deal
but
the
ink
wasn't
dry
when
the
plague
came
in
so
i
view
that
trade
deal
much
differently
than
i
did
"before,"
much
differently.
it's
a
great
deal.
they
just
last
"week,"
they
ordered
the
biggest
order
of
corn
in
"history,"
the
biggest
order
of
soybeans
in
"history,"
and
i
say
just
shows
you
though
they're
"smart,"
very
smart.
instead
of
saying
he's
not
talking
very
nicely
about
us
and
we're
not
going
to
order
any
"more,"
we're
not
going
to
do
"business,"
no.
instead
they
do
the
opposite.
they
give
us
the
biggest
orders
…
our
farmers
are
very
happy.
our
farmers
are
very
happy.
biggest
order
of
"corn,"
biggest
order
of
"beef,"
biggest
order
of
"soybeans,"
and
i
gave
the
farmers
$28
billion
because
that's
what
you
were
targeted
for
by
china
and
i
gave
you
28
out
of
the
tariffs
and
we
had
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
left
over
which
went
into
the
u.s.
treasury
but
nobody's
ever
done
this
before.
nobody's
ever
done
this
before.
with
biden
it's
the
reverse.
his
son
"goes,"
sits
down
for
10
minutes
with
the
father
and
whoever
the
hell
they
sat
down
with.
walks
out
with
one
and
a
half
billion
dollars
to
"manage,"
he'll
make
millions
of
dollars
a
"year,"
and
he
has
no
experience
at
all.
never
happened
before.
biden's
plan
is
to
appease
the
domestic
terrorists.
my
plan
is
to
arrest
them.
so
on
november
3
america
faces
a
very
simple
choice.
do
what
you
"want,"
vote
for
the
candidate
backed
by
violent
left
wing
rioters
if
you
have
"to,"
or
do
what
you
want
to
vote
for
the
candidate
backed
by
the
selfless
heroes
of
law
enforcement
and
just
about
everybody
else.
wait
till
you
see
the
numbers.
wait
till
you
see
the
numbers.
you
know
there
was
a
poll
that
just
came
"out,"
i
think
it
was
"gallup,"
and
it
was
a
weird
kind
of
a
poll
because
it
said
62%
of
the
people
that
are
polled
are
lying.
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
big
"number,"
"right?\""
i
think
it
was
62%
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
it
came
"out,"
and
they're
only
lying
if
it's
us
because
they
don't
want
to
be
bothered.
in
other
words
they're
not
lying
about
sleepy
"joe,"
they're
lying
about
"us,"
and
i
don't
know
if
i'm
supposed
to
love
that
or
hate
"it,"
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
insult
or
not
but
i
will
take
it.
we
don't
give
a
damn.
if
that's
the
"case,"
we
have
a
virtual
landslide
going.
we
have
a
virtual
landslide
and
this
would
look
like
it
it
would
have
been
"terrible,"
but
you
know
what?
fortunately
we
had
really
talented
people
taking
down
everything
word
for
word.
we
had
the
call
perfectly
and
if
i
didn't
have
"it,"
somehow
with
these
people
i
guess
i'd
still
be
here
if
you
want
to
know
the
"truth,"
but
it
was
a
lot
easier
but
we
were
196
to
"nothing,"
the
republicans
stuck
"together,"
and
kevin
mccarthy's
done
a
fantastic
job.
he
really
has.
with
the
exception
of
a
half
a
vote
from
mitt
"romney,"
you
can
have
him.
he's
not
too
"popular,"
i
want
to
tell
"you,"
he's
not
a
very
popular
guy
in
utah.
he's
not
too
popular.
so
it
was
52.5
to
a
half.
he's
a
"beauty,"
i'll
tell
you
that
guy.
he
couldn't
get
elected
dogcatcher
in
utah
right
now.
remember
"utah,"
they
said
it's
too
close
to
"call,"
this
was
before
the
"election,"
and
they
announced
"utah,"
the
polls
are
"closed,"
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
utah.
do
you
remember
that
like
immediately?
i
won
by
a
lot
and
there
was
some
guy
"running,"
"mcmuffin,"
mcmuffin.
"mcmuffin,"
he
was
supposed
to
be
second.
even
hillary
beat
him.
what
a
group.
lieutenant
governor
dan
"forest,"
dan?
get
out
and
vote
for
him.
get
out
and
vote
for
"him,"
okay?
i'll
tell
you
he'll
be
a
great
governor.
he
loves
your
"state,"
he'll
be
a
great
governor.
thom
is
going
to
be
a
"great,"
great
senator
for
another
six
"years,"
we
need
them
both
and
i
hope
you're
going
to
do
"well,"
dan.
i
know
you're
really
getting
up
"there,"
it's
getting
very
close.
i'll
be
"honest,"
if
this
governor
that
you
"have,"
i
know
him.
you
know
we
had
to
take
our
convention
"away,"
he
said
you're
allowed
to
have
10
people
in
the
"arena,"
"10,"
because
it
said
one
room
"10,"
you're
not
supposed
to
have
political
rallies.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
the
money
that
your
state
is
going
to
be
"losing?\""
but
if
this
guy
doesn't
open
up
your
"state,"
because
almost
all
of
them
are
open
"now,"
if
he
doesn't
open
up
your
"state,"
you
have
no
"choice,"
you're
going
to
vote
for
him
anyway
but
"dan,"
you'll
be
so
good.
dan
"forest,"
go
and
vote.

"jim,"
thank
you
very
much.
good

got
to
be
careful
with
those
"ballots,"
watch
those
ballots.
i
don't
like
"it,"
you
know
you
have
a
democrat
"governor,"
you
have
all
these
democrats
watching
that
stuff.
i
don't
like
it.
i
look
at
these
crowds
and
if
they're
going
to
cheat
crowds
are
meaningless.
"really,"
if
they're
going
to
"cheat,"
these
big
beautiful
"crowds,"
you
could
have
"15,000,"
you
could
have
"50,000,"
these
crowds
are
meaningless.
watch
"it,"
be
poll
watchers
when
you
go
there.
watch
all
the
thieving
and
stealing
and
robbing
they
do.
because
this
is
"important,"
we
win
north
"carolina,"
we
win.
we're
going
to
win

i
just
left
"florida,"
we're
going
to
win

we

about
a

we
love

he's
doing
a
great

robert

"robert,"
how
many
hostages
have
you
and
i
negotiated
to
get
"back,"
not
giving
anything
but
we
have
a
record
of
"what,"
robert?
"50,"
50
and
0.
we're
50
and
0
on
hostages.
we
got
them
"back,"
we
got
hostages
back
from
countries
that
you'd
never
even
heard
of
and
it's
been
pretty
amazing.
"robert,"
thank

thank
you

mick
it's

oh

very
outstanding

come

lindsey
graham
"everybody,"
lindsey

lindsey
and
tim
"scott,"
two
great
ones.
two
great
ones.
they
may
be
from
a
different
state
but
they
love
you
lindsey.
that's
good
and
tim
is
another
one.
so
we
have
just
incredible
people
in
the
party.
we've
achieved
more
in
four
years
than
anyone
ever
thought
possible
and
that's
driving
them
crazy.
we
passed
massive
tax
cuts
like
nobody
ever
thought
was
possible
for
hardworking
families
and
we
eliminated
a
record
number
of
job-killing
"regulations,"
more
than
any
president
in
history
whether
it
was
four
"years,"
eight
years
or
in
one
case
"more,"
"regulations,"
and
to
keep
family
farms
in
the
"family,"
we
eliminated
the
unfair
estate
tax
also
known
as
the
death
tax
on
your
small
farms
and
businesses.
"remember,"
that
was
a
terrible
thing.
people
were
fighting
for
"that,"
your
family
lost
the
"farm,"
lost
–
53].
"no,"
but
it
was
a
terrible
thing.
you'd
pass
away
and
your
kids
would
get
the
"farm,"
they'd
go
out
and
borrow
a
lot
of
money
because
the
estate
tax
was
massive.
they'd
put
big
mortgages
on
the
"farm,"
they'd
lose
the
"farm,"
they'd
lose
the
business.
you
don't
have
that
anymore.
i
saved
the
us
auto
industry
by
withdrawing
from
the
last
administration's
job-killing
"catastrophe,"
the
trans-pacific
partnership
was
a
disaster.
for
half
a
"century,"
joe
biden
shook
hands
with
blue
collar
"workers,"
and
then
he
turned
around
and
immediately
stabbed
them
in
the
back.
biden
supported
"nafta,"
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
"organization,"
"tpp,"
the
south
korea
disaster
deal
and
mass
amnesty
for
illegal
aliens.
think
of
it.
but
the
big
deal
"is,"
he's
changed.
he's
changed.
"\"after"
47
years
i've
changed.
i
swear
to
you
i've
"changed.\""
did
you
see
him
in
the
debates?
he
was
not
too
"good,"
but
that's
okay.
he
was
better
against
bernie.
something's
going
on
"there,"
i
don't
know.
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
but
he
was
better
against
bernie.
but
in
the
other
"debates,"
he
was
giving
them
everything
they
want.
free
healthcare
for
people
that
come
into
the
country
"illegally,"
"colleges,"
everything.
now
the
new
"deal,"
under
the
new
"deal,"
they
get
lawyers.
if
they
come
in
to
our
country
"illegally,"
we
supply
them
with
legal
advice.
you
believe
it
lawyers?
this
is
what
we
"need,"
is
more
lawyers.
this
state
lost
43%
of
all
manufacturing
jobs
after
the
twin
disasters
of
nafta
and
china's
entrance
into
the
world
trade
organization.
that's
courtesy
of
biden
and
his
friends.
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
to
north
carolina
when
we
ended
the
nafta
nightmare
and
we
signed
the
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
agreement
into
"law,"
it's
been
incredible.
everyone
"said,"
"\"impossible.\""
they
all
said
it
was
impossible
to
get
"done,"
we
got
it
done.
and
it's
a
great
deal.
and
it
prevents
"people,"
it
prevents
companies
from
fleeing
your
"state,"
opening
up
in
mexico
or
"canada,"
making
a
"product,"
selling
it
to
us
with…
it's
such
a
disincentive
to
do
that.
now
that
was
the
thing
that
was
most
important
to
me.
i
used
to
hate
when
i'd
see
all
these
companies
leaving
our
"country,"
going
to
mexico
in
"particular,"
but
canada
"also,"
a
lot
of
them
going
to
canada
and
they'd
make
a
"product,"
everybody
gets
fired
in
our
"country,"
they
close
their
business
and
they
make
the
same
product
in
a
different
"country,"
they
send
it
back
to
"us,"
no
tax
at
the
"border,"
no
"tariff,"
no
nothing.
it
doesn't
work
that
way
anymore.
i
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
"pillaging,"
"plundering,"
"ransacking,"
and
rampant
theft
of
north
carolina
jobs
and
us
jobs.
joe
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
"china,"
my
agenda
is
made
in
the
usa.
in
the
face
of
china's
economic
"aggression,"
we
provided
a
historic
$28
billion
in
relief
to
our
amazing
farmers.
i
will
always
stand
with
american
agriculture.
these
are
the
greatest
"people,"
the
finest
"people,"
and
we're
not
going
to
let
others
take
advantage
of
them.
for
20
"years,"
for
20
"years,"
you
look
at
a
"chart,"
it's
just
been
this
way
for
20
years.
"now,"
it's
going
back
up.
i
"mean,"
it
helped
that
i
gave
you
$28
billion
in
all
"fairness,"
right?
if
i
didn't
do
"that,"
and
i
took
it
all
from
"china,"
it
was
very
easy.
if
i
didn't
do
"that,"
i
think
you
wouldn't
have
any
farmers
right
now.
really.
it
was
a
difference
between
having
farmers
that
are
doing
well
and
having
no
farmers.
28
billion
over
two
"years,"
they
got
hit
one
"year,"
16
"billion,"
one
year
12
billion.
i
said
to
sonny
"perdue,"
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
great
"guy,"
an
"ex-farmer,"
governor
of
georgia
for
eight
"years,"
great
guy.
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
how
much
are
they
being
targeted
"for?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
$12
billion
for
the
year
"before,"
and
last
year
sir
was
"16.\""
so
i
"said,"
"\"28,"
"okay,"
that's
"fine.\""
i
"said,"
"\"we"
will
give
them
28
billion.
they
were
unfairly
"targeted.\""
and
that
was
in
order
to
get
"me,"
and
by
the
"way,"
china
wants
joe
biden
so
badly.
"oh,"
they
want…
and
you
know
who
else
would
like
them
very
badly?
iran
would
like
them
very
badly.
because
i
ended
that
iran
catastrophe
that
we
paid
150
billion
and
1.8
"billion,"
in
cash.
and
you
know
what's
going
to
happen?
they're
just
waiting
for
the
election
because
the
country
is
going
down
the
tubes.
their
gdp
went
down
24%.
nobody
ever
heard
of
that
before.
their
country
is
in
trouble.
i
don't
want
them
to
be
in
"trouble,"
but
they're
going
to
wait
till
after
the
election.
when
i
win
the
"election,"
they're
going
to
come
to
us
and
make
a
deal
so
fast.
watch
how
fast
it'll
be.
they're
dying
to
make
a
"deal,"
but
they
do
want
to
wait.
"\"let's"
wait
two
"months,"
maybe
we'll
get
lucky.
maybe
we're
going
to
get
lucky
and
slow
joe
gets
in
and
we're
going
to
make
a
great
"deal.\""
"no,"
there'll
be
in
immediately
after
the
election
and
they'll
make
a
"deal,"
we'll
make
a
fair
deal
with
them.
but
what
obama
did
and
biden
did
with
that
horrible
iran
deal.
i
ended
last
administration's
war
on
american
energy.
biden
has
pledged
to
end
production
of
american
oil
"shale,"
clean
"coal,"
no
"fracking,"
wiping
out
millions
of
jobs
and
forcing
us
to
buy
energy
from
foreign
polluters.
we
don't
want
to
buy
energy.
we've
done
that
for
a
long
"time,"
for
decades
and
decades.
we
don't
want
to
do
that
anymore.
i
like
being
energy
"independent,"
don't
you?
and
i'm
sure
that
most
of
you
notice
when
you
go
to
fill
up
your
tank
of
gas
in
your
"car,"
oftentimes
it's
below
$2.
you
"said,"
"\"how"
the
hell
did
this
ever
happen?
thank
you
president
"trump.\""
right?
thank
you
president
trump
and
look
at
your
electric
"bills,"
everything
else.
these
"guys,"
your
electric
would
go
up
"four,"
"five,"
six
times.
the
green
new
"deal,"
it's
called
the
green
new
nightmare.
while
i'm
"president,"
america
will
remain
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
on
earth
and
we
will
remain
energy
independent.
it
should
be
for
"many,"
many
years
to
come.
because
the
fact
"is,"
we
don't
have
to
be
in
the
middle
east
other
than
we
want
to
protect
israel.
we've
been
very
good
to
israel.
but
other
than
"that,"
we
don't
have
to
be
in
the
middle
east.
we
don't
need…
there
was
a
time
we
needed
"desperately,"
we
don't
need
that
anymore.
we
have
more
than
they
"do,"
isn't
that
nice?
after
years
of
rebuilding
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
building
our
country.
america
first.
it's
america
first.
to
bring
hope
to
our
inner
"cities,"
i
created
opportunities
zones.
i
worked
with
senator
tim
scott
of
south
"carolina,"
what
a
great
guy.
he
has
passed
criminal
justice
"reform,"
prison
"reform,"
delivered
permanent
funding
for
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
that
obama
never
"did,"
or
couldn't
do.
and
biden.
i
call
it
obiden.
o
biden.
it's
too
long
to
say
obama
and
"biden,"
just
call
it
obiden.
and
before
the
china
"virus,"
we
achieved
the
lowest
african
"american,"
hispanic
"american,"
asian
american
unemployment
rates
ever
recorded.
and
we're
heading
back
to
that
level
rapidly.
biden
spent
the
last
47
years
betraying
african
american
voters.
he
betrayed
them.
look
at
"1994,"
take
a
look
at
that.
he
betrayed
"them,"
what
he
did
to
them.
he
closed
the
factories
in
baltimore
and
sent
them
to
beijing.
they
were
all
sent
to
beijing.
so
many
people
went
there.
they
went
to
all
parts
of
the
"world,"
but
a
lot
went
to
beijing.
he
shattered
the
plants
in
chicago
and
sent
them
to
shanghai.
unlike
the
previous
"administration,"
under
my
administration
we
put
america
first.
and
"actually,"
if
we
weren't
interrupted
with
constant
investigations
that
went
nowhere.
and
nobody
has
been
through
what
i've
been
through
as
president
of
the
united
"states,"
nobody.
they
used
to
say
abraham
lincoln
got
the
worst
press.
i
"said,"
"\"there's"
no
way
he
got
worse
than
"me.\""
but
lincoln
was
"very,"
very
badly
treated
by
the
fake
news.
maybe
in
his
"case,"
it
was
real.
i
can
tell
"you,"
in
my
"case,"
it's
fake.
it's
totally
fake.
but
nobody's
been
and
should
never
be
allowed
to
happen
again.
let's
see
what
happens.
we
caught
them
cold.
let's
see
what
happens.
but
if
we
didn't
have
to…
that
takes
"time,"
and
"energy,"
and
all
other
things.

she
could
have
"said,"
"\"okay.\""
she
could
have
"said,"
"\"you"
got
"me.\""
but
she
"said,"
"\"i"
got
set
up
by
the
beauty
parlor
"owner,\""
who
happens
to
be
a
trump
person
by
the
way.
i
like
the
beauty
parlor
owner.
she
"said,"
"\"i"
got
set
up
by
the
owner
of
the
beauty
parlor.
she
set
me
"up.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
are
you
going
to
deal
with
"putin,"
kim
"jong-un,"
and
president
xi
of
"china?\""
"no,"
it's
"terrible,"
she's
always
preaching
about
the
mask.
"\"you"
got
to
wear
the
mask
at
all
"times,"
"indoor,"
outdoor.
when
you
go
to
bed
at
"night,"
put
the
mask
"on.\""
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
keeping
my
promises
and
delivering
for
the
african
american
community
and
when
i'm
reelected
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
i'll
tell
you
that.
perhaps
in
no
area
have
our
opponents
more
thoroughly
betrayed
working
families
of
all
backgrounds
than
on
the
subject
of
immigration.
under
my
"administration,"
we've
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
"now,"
i
have
to
tell
you
the
300
miles
of
wall
helps
a
lot.
remember
they
"said,"
"\"walls"
are
old
fashioned.
they
don't
"work.\""
really?
i
always
"say,"
and
i've
said
it
four
or
five
times.
i'll
say
it
again
if
you'd
like
me
"to,"
two
things
if
you
come
back
in
a
thousand
"years,"
2000
"years,"
or
3000
years.
if
you're
lucky
"enough,"
assuming
we
have
something
with
the
world
is
a
crazy
"place,"
isn't
it?
but
if
you
come
back
in
a
thousand
"years,"
there
are
two
"things,"
with
all
the
"computers,"
and
all
the
everything
changes
every
"day,"
you
invent
a
new
"cell,"
you
invent
a
new
laptop.
everything
is
obsolete
like
about
two
weeks
after
you
invent
"it,"
right?
two
things
that
will
never
get
"obsolete,"
the
wall
and
the
"wheel,"
right?
the
wheel
and
the
wall.
maybe
i'm
"wrong,"
who
knows?
but
i
would
say
walls
and
wheels
have
a
great
future.
we
ended
catch
and
"release,"
stopped
asylum
"fraud,"
and
we've
deported
"20,000"
gang
"members,"
including
the
radical
ms-13.
we
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
united
states
"military,"
all
made
in
the
usa
by
the
"way,"
we
have
the
"newest,"
finest
military
we've
ever
"had,"
and
gave
our
great
warriors
their
largest
pay
raises
in
"many,"
many
decades.
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
accountability
which
everybody
said
could
not
"happen,"
and
veterans
satisfaction
with
the
va
has
just
reached
"91%,"
the
highest
satisfaction
level
in
history.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal
as
i
"said,"
and
i
kept
my
promise
and
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
united
states
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
then
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
"heights,"
and
we
achieved
the
first
breakthrough
in
the
middle
east
peace
for
"many,"
many
"decades,"
decades.
even
the
new
york
times
said
that
was
an
amazing
achievement.
do
you
believe
that?
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
see
that
"one.\""
now
we
did
something
that
nobody
thought
was
possible.
"man,"
it's
"israel,"
as
you
"see,"
and
as
you've
"read,"
israel
and
"uae,"
highly
respected
"leader,"
"mohammed,"
"highly,"
highly
"respected,"
and
now
we
have
other
countries
in
the
middle
east.
they
all
want
to
come
in.
it's
going
to
be
a
beautiful
"picture,"
going
to
be
a
beautiful
picture.
we
killed
the
vicious
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
"al-baghdadi,"
we
killed
him.
why
didn't
biden
get
him?k
they
were
after
him
for
eight
"years,"
they
never
got
"him,"
i
got
him.
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murderer
of
american
"crews,"
qasem
"soleimani,"
we
got
him
too.
soleimani.
al-baghdadi
and
"soleimani,"
the
two
worst
terrorists
in
the
world
for
"many,"
many
"years,"
many
decades.
we
kept
america
out
of
new
wars
and
we're
bringing
our
troops
back
home.
we're
bringing
them
back
home
from
all
these
far
away
places.
we
spend
hundreds
of
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
what
do
we
get
out
of
it?
biden
voted
for
the
iraq
"war,"
he
supported
the
defense
sequester
that
gutted
our
"military,"
he
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
"laden,"
he
opposed
the
killing
of
"soleimani,"
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
"isis,"
and
for
eight
years
he
couldn't
find
or
kill
"al-baghdadi,"
the
founder
of
isis.
couldn't
find
"him,"
they
"looked,"
they
couldn't
find
him.
i
found
him
and
we
hit
him
good.
we
hit
him
good.
and
you
saw
the
mueller
family
on
television.
you
saw
that
at
the
"convention,"
what
al-baghdadi
did
with
their
beautiful
"daughter,"
and
incredible
how
our
troops
handled
that.
you
should
see
"it,"
it
was
incredible.
biden
also
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
positive
"development,"
positive
development
for
america
and
for
the
world.
how
are
we
doing
with
china?
we
just
have
the
"plague,"
we've
had
other
plagues
sent
by
them.
i
wonder
if
they
did
it
on
"purpose,"
what
do
you
think?
i
got
to
tell
"you,"
i
was
sailing
to
an
easy
election.
this
was
going
to
be
so
easy.
i
probably
would
have
not
been
here
tonight.
i
would
have
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
don't
have
to
bother.
this
is
going
to
"be…\""
and
now
we
have
to
work
against
a
guy
that
doesn't
know
where
he
"is,"
i
can't
believe
it.
when
i
banned
travel
from
"china,"
biden
called
it
hysterical
and
xenophobic.
do
you
remember
that?
i
banned
it.
everybody
told
"me,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
you
don't
have
to
do
"that.\""
but
i
"said,"
"\"we"
have
to
because
wuhan
is
very
infected
and
they're
coming
"here,\""
so
i
banned
it.
later
on
it
was
said
to
be
a
great
move.
if
we
had
listened
to
"joe,"
hundreds
of
thousands
more
americans
would
have
died.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
will
own
"america,"
and
it
won't
take
"long,"
with
his
"son,"
hunter
walking
out
with
all
of
that
money
with
no
experience
"whatsoever,"
no
investment…he
didn't
even
have
a
job.
joe
biden
is
weak
and
will
always
cave
to
china
who
is
strong.
when
the
virus
"arrived,"
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
we're
delivering
life-saving
therapies
and
we
have
achieved
some
of
the
great
numbers.
the

fatality
"rates,"
we
have
the
lowest
of
any
major
country
in
the
world.
people
don't
know
that
because
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to
write
about
it.
under
operation
warp
"speed,"
we're
producing
a
vaccine
in
record
time.
this
is
a
vaccine
that
we're
going
to
have
very
"soon,"
"very,"
very
"soon,"
by
the
end
of
the
"year,"
but
much
sooner
than
"that,"
perhaps.
and
this
is
something
that's
incredible.
this
would
have
taken
two
or
three
years
by
the
last
"administration,"
and
in
all
"fairness,"
by
most
other
administrations.
we
have
upped
it
to
a
level
that
nobody
even
believes
is
"possible,"
and
totally
safe.
joe
biden
and
kamala
"harris,"
rated
the
most
"liberal,"
are
undermining
science
and
risking
countless
lives
with
their
reckless
anti-vaccine
rhetoric.
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
so
now
they
know
we
have
it.
it's
only
a
question
of
weeks
or
a
small
amount
of
time.
so
instead
of
"saying,"
"\"that's"
a
great
thing.
we're
going
to
save
"lives,\""
they're
trying
to
disparage
"it,"
they're
trying
to
make
it
politics.
they're
trying
to
do
so.
and
now
what's
going
to
happen
is
we'll
have
"it,"
and
people
won't
want
to
take
it.
that's
really
bad.
okay?
that's
really
bad.
but
the
biden-harris
effort
to
spread
anti-vaccine
conspiracy
theories
only
because
they
know
we're
close
to
putting
it
"out,"
getting
it
"out,"
and
we're
going
to
get
it
out
fast.
the
vaccine
will
be
safe.
these
are
the
greatest
companies
in
the
world
to
do
"this,"
the
greatest
"labs,"
the
greatest
"doctors,"
it'll
be
effective
and
it'll
be
delivered
before
the
end
of
the
year.
and
maybe
as
i
"said,"
much
sooner
than
that.
joe
biden's
plan
to
impose
a
blanket
shutdown
would
collapse
our
economy
and
cause
countless
deaths
from
"suicide,"
"drugs,"
alcohol
"abuse,"
heart
"disease,"
and
much
more.
and
that's
what
you're
in
right
now.
you're
in
a
shutdown.
it's
crazy.
i've
been
to
many
"states,"
they're
not
in
shutdowns
and
they're
doing
better.
they're
doing
better.
somebody's
got
to
speak
to
this
"man,"
dan.
maybe
you
got
to
talk
to
"him,"
dan.
go
in
a
little
early
and
"say,"
"\"you"
don't
know
what
the
hell
you're
doing?
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing.
they're
hurting
our
"people.\""
north
carolina
has
to
open
up.
by
"contrast,"
my
administration
is
following
the
"science,"
protecting
those
at
highest
risk
while
allowing
those
at
lower
risk
to
safely
return
to
work
and
to
"school,"
go
back
to
"school,"
go
back
to
school.
you
ever
see
the
statistics
on
young
people?
i
don't
know.
they
have
a
great
immune
system.
let's
get
some
of
that
immune
"system,"
but
they're
amazing.
i
"mean,"
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
and
they're
not
even
"affected,"
very
little
meaning
a
small
percentage
of
1%.
it's
an
incredible
thing.
nobody
knew
that
when
it
first
came
"here,"
nobody
assumed
a
thing
like
that
was
possible.
but
young
people
are
very
strong
against
this
horrible
disease.
through
our
historic
china
virus
relief
"programs,"
we've
saved
more
than
1.3
million
jobs
for
north
carolina
workers.
that
worked
out
great.
we
provided
$380
million
in
relief
for
north
carolina
farmers
and
made
$10
million
in
ppp
loans
to
save-
…
and
made
$10
million
in
ppp
loans
to
save
your
state's
tobacco
growers.
we
saved
your
tobacco
growers.
we
have
them
very
much
in
our
sites.
we
want
to
help
them.
the
biden
agenda
would
crush
this
comeback
and
put
our
families
in
grave
danger.
biden
is
promising
to
reimpose
job-destroying
regulations.
we
got
rid
of
more
"regulations,"
he
wants
to
put
those
regulations
back
plus
50%.
you
couldn't
build
a
road.
we
took
roads
from
"18,"
"19,"
and
even
20
years
approval
down
to
two
and
we'll
have
it
down
to
one.
you
may
get
rejected
for
a
highway
or
for
a
"road,"
but
you're
going
to
know
in
the
period
of
12
months
to
24
months.
you're
not
going
to
spend
an
entire
lifetime
and
then
have
them
raise
their
hand.
i
know
all
about
it
from
the
real
estate
"business,"
we
brought
it
all
the
way
down.
he
wants
to
give
illegal
aliens
government
healthcare
and
taxpayer
funded
"lawyers,"
establish
a
national
sanctuary
city
policy
for
illegal
aliens
with
criminal
records.
you
wouldn't
believe.
i
"mean,"
this
stuff
is
not
even
really
"believable,"
but
it
is
what
it
is.
he
wants
to
surge
refugee
admissions
by
700%
into
our
country.
flooding
your
towns
with
poorly
vetted
"migrants,"
including
many
from
jihadist
regions
of
the
world.
biden
opposes
school
"choice,"
he
opposes
north
carolina
opportunity
scholarships.
and
he
has
stated
that
if
he
is
"elected,"
charter
schools
are
gone.
he
"said,"
they're
gone.
and
they've
been
incredible.
in
the
second
term
i'll
provide
school
choice
to
every
parent
in
america.
and
we'll
also
take
good
care
of
our
teachers.
our
teachers
are
"very,"
very
important
to
me.
very
"important,"
nothing
more
important.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
"jobs,"
and
a
limitless
future
for
all
americans.
and
just
in
"finishing,"
i
have
to
say
that
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world.
and
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we'll
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
states.
we
will
enact
fair
trade
deals
that
create
american
jobs
and
grow
american
wages.
we
are
going
to
bring
our
companies
back
home
where
they
should
be.
i've
been
doing
a
lot
of
"it,"
but
we
are
going
to
do
it
at
a
level
that
nobody
ever
thought
possible.
we
will
rapidly
return
to
full
"employment,"
soaring
"wages,"
and
record
prosperity.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increased
penalties
for
assaults
or
law
"enforcement,"
"surge,"
federal
prosecutors
into
high
crime
communities
and
ban
all
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
protect
government
benefits
for
american
"citizens,"
not
for
illegal
aliens.
what
you're
doing
when
you
have
all
of
these
"advantages,"
when
you're
giving
them
free
"healthcare,"
and
free
"lawyers,"
and
free
"college,"
and
free
"everything,"
they
all
come.
they
didn't
think
of
"coming,"
but
they
see
"this,"
they
talk
and
they
talk
to
their
friends
and
they
all
come
in.
they
want
to
come
to
america.
you're
just
bringing
people
in
and
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
we
want
people
to
come
to
our
"country,"
but
they
have
to
come
in
through
merit
and
they
have
to
come
in
"legally,"
very
simple.
we
will
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
and
justices
who
believe
in
enforcing
the
"law,"
not
their
own
political
agenda.
we
will
ensure
equal
justice
for
the
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
"speech,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
to
threaten
our
citizens
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
endless
ridiculous
foreign
wars.
we'll
build
up
our
military
like
it's
never
been
built
up
before.
we
need
our
military
for
other
reasons.
we
will
have
the
strongest
we
have
now.
when
i
took
"over,"
our
military
was
depleted.
we
have
a
lot
of
military
people
here.
our
military
was
"depleted,"
our
planes
were
50
years
old.
now
you
have
brand
"new,"
beautiful
"f35s,"
we
have
brand
new
rockets
and
missiles.
and
hopefully
we
never
have
to
use
"them,"
i
will
say
that.
but
the
best
way
of
not
having
to
use
them
is
to
have
them.
if
you
have
them…
we
learned
that
in
the
school
"yards,"
right?
we
learned
that
in
the
school
"yards,"
the
best
way
is
to
have
them.
we
have
the
strongest
military
we've
ever
had
by
far.
we'll
end
surprise
medical
billing
"require,"
price
"transparency,"
which
i've
already
signed
into
"law,"
which
by
the
"way,"
kicks
in
on
january
1st.
you
better
elect
me
north
carolina.
i
did
price
transparency
and
i've
cut
the
price.
drugs
are
going
to
start
going
down
at
levels
nobody's
ever
seen
favored
nations.
so
we
did
price
"transparency,"
kicks
in
january
1st.
could
you
imagine
if
this
guy's
president
and
your
prices
start
to
go
way
"down,"
"hospitalization,"
"doctors,"
you
can
choose
your
own
doctor
unlike
with
"obama,"
right?
price
is
going
way
"down,"
january
1st.
i
"said,"
couldn't
you
start
it
"sooner,"
but
statutorily
that's
when
it
had
it
start.
could
you
imagine
if
this
guy's
in
and
prices
start
dropping
like
a
rock?
and
they'll
"say,"
what
a
great
president
he
is.
he
would
have
never
done
it.
and
your
drug
"prices,"
prescription
"drug,"
i'm
instituting
favorite
nations
laws.
so
we're
going
to
pay
what
other
nations
pay
at
the
lowest.
and
you'rr
going
to
get
back
rebates
that
were
given
to
middlemen
who
have
to
be
the
richest
people
in
the
world.
we'll
protect
medicare
and
social
"security,"
and
we
will
protect
your
social
security.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
"conditions,"
always.
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on
mars.
very
exciting.
and
i
will
reopen
nasa.
that
place
was
gone.
they
had
grass
growing
out
of
the
"runways,"
you
had
to
see
it.
now
it's
the
number
one
space
center
in
the
world
by
far.
you
see
what's
going
on.
we
will
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools.
"oh,"
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
look
at
you.
this
is
a
very
sophisticated
"group,"
tom.
you
know
what
i'm
talking
"about,"
patriotic
education.
"well,"
the
first
thing
they
do
is
they
want
to
take
your
history
away.
that's
a
great
group
behind
me.
i
don't
know.
they're
activists.
but
you
know
what?
you
know
what
it
"means,"
they
want
to
take
away
your
history.
that's
why
the
monuments
and
the
"statutes,"
they
want
to
knock
them
down.
the
first
thing
they
do
is
take
away
your
guts.
it's
guts.
they
take
away
your
"guts,"
they
take
away
your
"statues,"
they
take
away
your
heroes.
they
take
away
your
great
generals.
they
take
away
your
past.
and
i
"said,"
it
was
going
to
happen.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
what?
they
started
off
with
generals
and
colonels
and
others
that
nobody
ever
heard
"of.\""
and
i
thought
that
was
bad.
and
then
they
went
up
a
little
bit
and
now
i
"said,"
"\"someday"
it's
going
to
be
robert
"lee,"
someday
it's
going
to
be
"washington,"
someday
it's
going
to
be
lincoln.
someday
it's
going
to
be
"jefferson,"
someday
it's
going
to
be
benjamin
franklin.
it's
all
of
them.
they
take
away
your
past.
they
never
taken
away
our
past.
that's
the
way
they
do
it.
you
study
it.
that's
the
way
they
go.
they
take
away
your
guts.
we'll
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
will
live
by
the
timeless
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
trust.
this
is
better
than
the
"arenas,"
i
have
to
"say,"
especially
when
you
have
a
crowd
like
this.
but
they're
like
this.
they
have
such
spirit
in
this
country.
people
love
our
country
so
much.
i
went
to
"texas,"
i
went
to
"ohio,"
i
went
to
"florida,"
it's
always
like
this.
they
love
our
country
and
we're
not
going
to
disappoint
anybody.
we're
not
disappointed.
for
years
you
had
a
president
who
apologized
for
america…
so
you
had
a
president
who
apologized
for
"america,"
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
standing
up
for
the
people
of
north
carolina.
this
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
wouldn't
say
that
lightly.
and
"frankly,"
i
thought
the
last
one
"was,"
and
i
said
"it,"
but
they've
gone
to
a
level
that
nobody
even
thought
possible.
these
people
have
gotten
stone
"cold,"
crazy.
and
you
know
what?
after
we
get
"in,"
we're
going
to
have
tremendous
success.
and
it
was
building.
we
were
at
a
"point,"
we
were
so
successful
before
the
plague
came
in
from
china.
we
were
so
successful
that
we
were
starting
to
get
together.
people
forget.
we
were
starting…
success
brings
people
together.
it
was
so
good.
our
jobs
numbers
were
so
good.
and
whether
it
was
the
black
"community,"
the
hispanic
"community,"
the
asian
"community,"
our
jobs
were
so
"good,"
our
numbers
were
so
good.
we
were
getting
together
and
then
the
plague
came
in
and
we
had
to
stop.
we
had
to
close
it
up.
we
had
to
open
it
and
start
all
over
again.
if
you
would
have
told
me
that
we
have
one
of
the
highest
stock
"market,"
some
of
the
stock
markets
have
already
broken
every
record.
you
look
at
"nasdaq,"
you
look
at
some…
we're
far
ahead
of
what
i
had
planned.
we're
far
ahead
of
schedule.
but
we
did
it
"once,"
we
have
to
do
it
again
because
this
was
an
unforeseen
"event,"
a
terrible
"event,"
a
horrible
event.
so
many
people
died.
nobody
should
have
"died,"
not
one
person.
so
many
people
"died,"
but
if
we
didn't
do
it
"right,"
we
would
have
lost
millions
of
people.
just
a
terrible
thing.
but
oftentimes
i
"say,"
bring
people
together.
and
then
i
"realized,"
if
you
look
at
that
last
few
"months,"
we
were
starting
to
come
together.
i
was
getting
calls
"from,"
you
won't
believe
"it,"
democrats.
i
was
getting
calls
from
democrats
and
they
were
"saying,"
"\"wow,"
things
are
going
really
"well.\""
it
was
starting
to
happen
and
now
we
have
to
get
it
back
to
a
level
of
great
success
because
it'll
happen
again.
there'll
be
great
"unity,"
eventually
there'll
be
great
unity.
so
get
your
"friends,"
and
get
your
"family,"
get
your
"neighbors,"
and
your
coworkers
and
vote.
and
i
say
this
because
it's
from
charlotte
to
kitty
"hawk,"
from
durham
to
"asheville,"
and
from
wilmington
to
right
here
in
winston-salem.
we
inherit
the
legacy
of
north
carolina
patriots
who
gave
their
"blood,"
"sweat,"
and
tears
for
this
beloved
nation.
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
heroes
who
crossed
the
"oceans,"
blaze
the
"trails,"
settle
the
"continent,"
tame
the
"wilderness,"
dug
out
the
panama
"canal,"
laid
down
the
"railroads,"
revolutionized
"industry,"
"one,"
two
world
"wars,"
defeated
fascism
and
"communism,"
and
made
america
the
single
greatest
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
we
are
making
it
greater
than
ever
before.
proud
and
great
citizens
like
you
helped
build
this
country
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
with

"[well,"
thank
you
very
much.
vice
president
mike
"pence,"
great
job
you're
doing.
and
hello
toledo!
we
love
toledo.
you
"remember,"
i
was
here
a
lot.
you
remember
"2016,"
what
a
year
that
"was,"
right?
and
2020
is
going
to
be
even
"better,"
no
doubt.
but
i'm
thrilled
to
hold
the
first
rally
of
2020
right
here
in
the
great
state
of
ohio.
and
as
we
begin
the
new
"year,"
our
economy
is
"booming,"
wages
are
"soaring,"
workers
are
"thriving,"
and
america's
future
has
"never,"
ever
looked
"brighter,"
ever.
we're
the
envy
of
every
country
in
the
world.
we've
created
seven
million
brand
new
jobs
since
our
election.
and
we
will
soon
be
replacing
the
disaster
known
as
nafta
with
the
incredible
brand
new
"usmca,"
the
historic
victory
for
ohio
"farmers,"
"workers,"
and
"manufacturers,"
but
really
a
great
victory
for
the
united
states.
it's
an
incredible
agreement.
you
remember
i
came
and
i'd
always
talk
about
how
bad
our
trade
deals
are.
we
did
a
brand
new
one
with
korea.
so
now
we
have
south
"korea,"
we
just
finished
a
big
"one,"
$40
billion
with
japan.
on
january
"15,"
we're
signing
a
"monster,"
a
big
beautiful
"monster,"
$40
to
$50
billion
to
our
farmers.
our
farmers
will
be
taking
"in,"
i
keep
saying
go
buy
larger
tractors.
go
buy
larger
tractors.
i
said
there's
no
"way,"
i
don't
know
if
you
know
this
"story,"
my
people
wanted
20
billion
to
"purchase,"
right?
20
"billion,"
"20,"
that's
a
lot
"money,"
that's
a
lot
of
"corn,"
$20
"billion,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"make"
it
50.
china's
very
"big.\""
and
they
"said,"
"\"okay.\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
the
farmers
can't
produce
that
"much.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let"
the
farmers
tell
me
that.
tell
them
to
go
out
"and,"
"remember,"
and
buy
a
bigger
what?
"tractor,"
buy
a
bigger
"tractor.\""
you'll
produce
it.
so
$40
to
$50
billion
of
agriculture
product
and
the
manufacturers
and
the
car
"companies,"
and
we
brought
a
lot
of
car
companies
into
"ohio,"
you
know
that.
a
lot
of
them
are
coming
in.
a
lot
of
them
have
already
been
brought
in.
they're
coming
in
from
"japan,"
they're
coming
in
from
all
over
the
world.
this
is
where
they
want
to
be.
they
want
to
be
in
the
united
states.
this
is
where
the
action
is.
they're
all
coming
back.
i
used
to
go
around
and
talk
about
how
everyone's
leaving.
they
were
all
leaving.
a
lot
of
you
were
victims
of
that
leaving.
these
companies
would
"leave,"
they'd
go
to
"mexico,"
they'd
go
to
"canada,"
they'd
close
"up,"
they'd
buy
from
china.
now
they're
all
coming
"back,"
new
"ones,"
old
"ones,"
they're
all
coming
"back,"
and
many
are
coming
right
here
to
ohio.
and
just
in
case
you
didn't
know
"it,"
ohio
just
had
the
best
year
economically
in
the
history
of
your
state.
that's
not
"bad,"
that's
not
bad.
and
this
year's
going
to
be
even
better
and
maybe
much
better.
but
weeks
"ago,"
i
signed
the
largest
ever
investment
in
the
united
states
"military,"
$
738
"billion,"
and
we
created
the
sixth
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
"forces,"
the
space
"force,"
and
everybody's
excited
about
that.
after
years
and
years
of
devastating
defense
"cuts,"
we
have
fully
rebuilt
the
united
states
military.
some
of
it's
still
coming
in.
we
have
everything.
we've
got
new
"planes,"
we've
got
new
"rockets,"
new
"missiles,"
we've
got
new
"everything,"
and
it's
either
here
or
coming
"in,"
$2.5
trillion
in
new
investments.
so
our
military
is
now
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
ever
before.
and
if
you
"remember,"
three
years
ago
when
i
took
"over,"
we
were
depleted.
our
military
was
totally
depleted.
and
by
the
"way,"
speaking
of
our
"military,"
have
we
taken
care
of
our
vets
with
"choice,"
with
choice.
that
was
a
big
thing.
you
"know,"
i
used
to
go
around
and
the
va
was
a
terrible
situation.
people
would
wait
weeks.
he's
"right,"
he
"said,"
"\"yes,"
it
"was.\""
you
don't
hear
too
much
about
that
"anymore,"
have
you
noticed?
choice
and
"accountability,"
you
know
what
accountability
is?
for
44
"years,"
they
tried
to
get
accountability.
that's
somebody
"bad,"
works
for
the
"va,"
you
couldn't
fire
them.
you
couldn't
fire
them.
they
could
be
"sadistic,"
they
could
be
"thieves,"
they
could
be
whatever
they
"were,"
you
couldn't
get
rid
of
them.
we
got
accountability
"approved,"
and
now
we
"say,"
"\"you're"
"fired,"
get
"out.\""
we
get
somebody
that's
good.
44
"years,"
and
maybe
most
importantly
of
all
is
"choice,"
"va,"
veterans
choice.
so
you
now
wait
in
"line,"
and
a
lot
of
times
you'd
wait
in
line
for
four
or
"five,"
six
weeks
you
couldn't
see
a
doctor.
now
you
don't
have
to
wait.
you
go
out
to
a
private
"doctor,"
you
get
yourself
taken
care
"of,"
we
pay
the
bill.
what
a
difference
it's
made.
what
a
difference
it's
made.
you
"know,"
when
i
was
a
little
bit
newer
to
this
game–
that's
"okay,"
they
got
"it,"
they
got
it.
they
go
home
to
mommy.
go
on
home
to
mommy.
go
on
home
to
mommy.
it's
a
beautiful
sight.
thank
"you,"
security.
do
we
love
law
"enforcement,"
by
the
way?
so
with
the
"va,"
i
used
to
go
around
"saying,"
"\"why"
don't
they
do
that?
why
don't
these
"people,"
why
don't
they
go
to
a
private
doctor
and
work
something
"out?\""
and
i
thought
it
was
a
brilliant
plan.
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
telling
you
i
am
such
a
smart
"guy.\""
i
"said,"
"\"this"
is
the
most
brilliant
thing
"ever.\""
and
i
went
back
to
my
people
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
have
an
idea.
a
veteran's
"sick,"
they
can't
get
the
kind
of
service
they
"need,"
they
need
a
certain
kind
of
"doctor,"
i
have
an
"idea,"
such
a
great
idea.
you
get
to
go
"out,"
"private,"
you're
going
to
pick
out
a
"doctor,"
you're
going
to
get
yourself
fixed
up.
we're
going
to
pay
the
"bill,"
"right?\""
and
you
know
what
happened?
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
brilliant
is
"that?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we've
been
working
on
that
for
48
"years,"
but
we've
never
been
able
to
get
it
"approved.\""
so
i
was
"very,"
very
"disillusioned,"
but
you
know
what
i'm
good
at?
getting
things
approved.
and
we
got
it
approved.
so
we
signed
that
11
months
"ago,"
and
what
a
difference
that's
made
in
terms
of
your
lines
and
in
terms
of
people's
health.
people
would
wait
online
for
"weeks,"
and
some
people
weren't
very
sick
and
they'd
end
up
being
terminally
ill.
they
couldn't
get
to
see
the
doctor.
now
they
go
"out,"
they
get
a
"doctor,"
we
take
care
of
them.
we
can
take
care
of
our
vets.
so
we're
using
this
great
power
not
to
pursue
"conflict,"
but
to
really
"preserve,"
and
i
mean
in
the
true
sense
of
the
"word,"
preserve
peace.
we
have
this
tremendous
"military,"
and
you
know
what
that
is?
that's
really
a
great
fighting
"force,"
but
i
hope
we
never
have
to
use
it.
i
really
do.
you
saw
an
example
of
that
a
couple
of
days
ago.
so
we
seek
"friends,"
not
"enemies,"
but
if
you
dare
to
threaten
our
"citizens,"
you
do
so
at
your
own
grave
peril.
we've
never
had
a
"military,"
what
we
have
"now,"
we've
never
had
anything
like
it.
we
were
looking
at
planes
that
were
old
and
"tired,"
"50,"
60-year-old
planes.
you've
heard
the
"story,"
the
grandfather
flew
"them,"
the
son
flew
"them,"
the
current
wonderful
person
flew
"them,"
the
whole
family
flew
them.
those
are
all
gone
"now,"
folks.
those
are
all
gone.
in
october
of
last
"year,"
us
special
operations
forces
executed
a
daring
nighttime
raid
that
killed
the
bloodthirsty
founder
and
leader
of
isis.
the
animal
known
as
al-
baghdadi
is
dead.
and
the
entire
isis
caliphate
is
"destroyed,"
and
his
terrorist
"empire,"
and
he
was
indeed
a
"monster,"
has
been
totally
demolished.
we
killed
thousands
and
thousands
of
isis
"warriors,"
"fighters,"
and
we
have
thousands
of
them
right
now
locked
up
where
they
should
be.
nobody
has
ever
done
what
we've
done
in
three
years.
and
i'll
say
"this,"
when
we
took
it
"over,"
it
was
a
mess.
we
did
it
in
a
short
period
of
"time,"
but
when
we
took
it
"over,"
it
was
not
good.
and
last
"week,"
the
united
states
once
again
took
the
bold
and
decisive
action
to
save
american
lives
and
deliver
american
justice.
and
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
for
"years,"
the
sadistic
mass
"murderer,"
qasam
"soleimani,"
planned
and
executed
attacks
against
american
"targets,"
killing
and
wounding
thousands
of
us
service
members
and
"many,"
many
"thousands,"
and
even
hundreds
of
"thousands,"
of
other
people.
as
the
leader
of
iran's
terrorist
quds
"force,"
soleimani
spread
"death,"
"destruction,"
and
mayhem
across
the
middle
east
and
far
beyond.
he
ordered
the
violent
assault
on
the
american
embassy
in
baghdad.
and
you
saw
this
was
the
anti-benghazi.
we
got
there
very
quickly.
we
got
there
very
quickly.
this
is
the
exact
"opposite,"
we
did
it
exactly
the
opposite
of
"benghazi,"
where
they
got
there
so
"late,"
all
they
saw
when
they
got
there
days
later
were
burning
embers
from
the
days
before.
that's
all
they
saw.
we
got
there
very
early.
we
saw
what
was
happening.
i
saw
what
was
"happening,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
that
all
"about?\""
and
that
was
going
to
be
another
benghazi.
had
they
broken
through
the
final
panels
of
"glass,"
they
were
breaking
and
breaking
"it,"
had
they
gotten
"through,"
we
would
have
had
either
hundreds
of
dead
people
or
hundreds
of
hostages.
that
wasn't
going
to
happen.
and
i
called
up
our
great
"generals,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"get"
them
over
there
"now.\""
and
one
of
our
"leaders,"
one
of
our
really
admired
"people,"
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we'll
have
them
there
"tomorrow.\""
i
"said,"
"\"nope,"
get
in
the
planes
right
"now,"
have
them
there
"immediately,\""
and
they
got
there
"immediately,"
fortunately.
but
he
directed
the
recent
rocket
strikes
that
wounded
four
american
service
"members,"
badly
"wounded,"
and
killed
an
american
citizen.
that
was
just
before
we
happened
to
hit
him.
soleimani
was
actively
planning
new
attacks
and
he
was
looking
very
seriously
at
our
"embassies,"
and
not
just
the
embassy
in
baghdad.
but
we
stopped
"him,"
we
stopped
him
quickly
and
we
stopped
him
cold.
so
at
my
"direction,"
the
united
states
military
eliminated
qasam
soleimani
and
ended
his
rampage
through
not
only
that
part
of
the
"world,"
but
much
bigger
parts
of
the
"world,"
he
was
all
over.
he
was
a
bad
"guy,"
he
was
a
bloodthirsty
terror
and
he's
no
longer
a
"terror,"
he's
dead.
and
yet
now
i
see
the
radical
left
democrats
have
expressed
outrage
over
the
termination
of
this
horrible
terrorist.
and
you
"know,"
instead
they
should
be
outraged
by
soleimani's
savage
crimes
and
the
fact
that
his
countless
victims
were
denied
justice
for
so
long.
he
was
the
king
of
the
roadside
bomb.
you
know
of
the
roadside
"bomb,"
and
then
they
got
"bigger,"
and
he'd
send
them
over
to
afghanistan
and
iraq.
and
when
you
see
our
friends
and
our
great
wounded
warriors
and
our
great
"warriors,"
when
you
see
them
without
their
legs
and
without
arms
and
with
so
much
"damage,"
it's
most
likely
that
he
caused
that
"damage,"
because
that's
what
he
liked.
he
loved
planting
the
roadside
bomb.
so
now
he's
"gone,"
and
that's
a
good
thing.
bernie
"sanders,"
crazy
"bernie,"
has
condemned
the
us
military
strike
on
"soleimani,"
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
think
of
"it,"
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
and
we're
having
people
like
nancy
"pelosi,"
that's
a
real
"genius,"
do
you
believe
that
one?
"nancy,"
nervous
nancy.
but
here's
a
guy
who
slaughtered
and
butchered
civilians
all
over
and
"military,"
whoever
was
in
his
"way,"
and
we
have
bernie
and
nancy
"pelosi,"
we
have
them
"all,"
they're
all
trying
to
"say,"
"\"how"
dare
you
take
him
out
that
way?
you
should
get
permission
from
congress.
you
should
come
in
and
tell
us
what
you
want
to
do.
you
should
come
in
and
tell
us
so
that
we
can
call
up
the
fake
news
that's
back
there
and
we
can
leak
"it.\""
that's
a
lot
of
corruption
back
"there,"
folks.
"no,"
but
"think,"
"seriously,"
so
they
want
me…
so
these
are
split-second
decisions.
you
have
to
make
a
decision.
so
they
don't
want
me
to
make
that
decision.
they
want
me
to
call
"up,"
maybe
go
over
"there,"
let
me
go
over
to
"congress,"
or
come
on
over
to
the
white
"house,"
let's
talk
about
it.
when
can
you
make
it?
"well,"
i
won't
be
able
to
make
it
"today,"
"sir,"
so
how
about
say
in
a
couple
of
days?
"oh,"
"good,"
come
on
over.
"no,"
we
got
a
"call,"
we
heard
where
he
"was,"
we
knew
the
way
he
was
getting
"there,"
and
we
had
to
make
a
decision.
we
didn't
have
time
to
call
up
"nancy,"
who
is
not
operating
with
a
full
deck.
"no,"
they
want
us
to
"call,"
can
you
imagine
calling
crooked
adam
schiff?
he's
so
"crooked,"
he's
so
crooked.
shifty
schiff
and
"say,"
"\"gee,"
"adam,"
how
are
you
doing?
"listen,"
we
have
the
world's
number
one
"terrorist,"
killed
thousands
and
thousands
of
people.
we'd
like
to
set
up
a
meeting
so
we
can
discuss
his
execution.
would
you
be
willing
to
"meet?\""
"\"well,"
i
won't
be
able
to
make
it
this
"week.\""
"\"well,"
you
"know,"
he's
traveling
fast.
we
got
him
lined
"up,"
"adam,"
you
little
"pencil-neck.\""
nine
inches.
he
buys
the
smallest
shirt
collar
you
can
"get,"
and
it's
loose.
now
come
"on,"
"adam,"
we
got
to
meet
faster
on
it.
we
got
to
take
this
guy
out.
we're
not
going
to
have
another
shot
at
him
maybe
ever
again.
"\"but"
i
can't
make
it
now
because
i'm
trying
to
impeach
"trump,"
i'm
trying
to
"impeach,"
even
though
he
did
nothing
"wrong.\""
by
the
"way,"
did
you
"see,"
i
did
nothing
wrong.
they
don't
even
know
what
in
the
hell
is
going
on.
in
"fact,"
it's
so
"weak,"
she
doesn't
want
to
put
in
the
"articles,"
it's
so
weak.
they're
so
pathetic.
they're
so
pathetic.
so
they
want
us
to
call
them.
"now,"
schiff
is
a
big
leaker.
he
leaks
to
crazy
cnn.
see
with
the
little
red
light
on
over
there.
not
too
many
people
are
watching
cnn.
but
he
leaks.
so
he'll
"say,"
"\"you"
"know,"
off
the
"record,"
i
got
to
hurry
up
because
everyone's
watching
me
in
the
hallway
on
my
cell
"phone,"
off
the
record
they've
got
the
number
one
terrorist
in
the
"world,"
"soleimani,"
and
they're
going
to
get
"him,"
they're
going
to
take
him
out
in
the
next
10
minutes.
"please,"
don't
tell
anybody
i
told
"you.\""
so
we
have
breaking
"news,"
president
trump
within
the
next
"20,"
25
"minutes,"
looks
to
be
taking
out
terrorist
general
soleimani.
he's
going
to
do
it.
it
should
be
happening
in
about
the
next
20
"minutes,"
"19,"
"18,"
"17.\""
then
we
get
back
to
the
"battlefield,"
how'd
you
"do,"
fellas?
"\"i"
don't
"know,"
"sir,"
he
disappeared.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
"him.\""
they
want
us
to
tell
them
so
that
they
can
leak
it
to
their
friends
in
the
corrupt
media.
you
got
to
say
"though,"
that's
a
lot
of
"media,"
right?
that's
the
way
the
academy
awards
used
to
look
when
it
was
successful.
then
they
started
hitting
us
all
the
time
and
it
became
unsuccessful.
i
love
"it,"
i
love
"it,"
actually.
"oh,"
they
have
some
bad
ones
here
tonight.
they
have
some
really
bad
"ones,"
some
really
sick
ones.
they
have
one
good
"one,"
by
the
"way,"
one
good
one.
they
have
one
good
"one,"
a
bunch
of
bad
ones.
"very,"
very
dishonest
people
and
we
have
some
great
"ones,"
too.
we
have
some
great
"journalists,"
great
reporters.
but
you've
got
a
tremendous
amount
of
dishonest
media
people
like
i
have
never
seen
in
my
life
before.
they
write
things
that
they
know
are
wrong.
they
"write,"
if
you
watched
for
the
last
three
"years,"
think
of
"it,"
and
then
they
get
pulitzer
"prizes,"
but
it
turned
out
to
be
all
wrong.
how
do
you
do
that?
they
get
pulitzer
prizes
for
being
wrong.
the
pulitzer
prize
doesn't
mean
a
thing.
it
doesn't
mean
a
thing.
i
"mean,"
i'm
here
to
tell
you
about
the
nobel
peace
prize.
i'll
tell
you
about
that.
i
made
a
deal.
i
saved
a
country.
and
i
just
heard
that
the
head
of
that
country
is
now
getting
the
noble
peace
prize
for
saving
the
country.
i
"said,"
"\"did"
i
have
something
to
do
with
"it?\""
"yeah,"
but
you
"know,"
that's
the
way
it
is.
as
long
as
we
"know,"
that's
all
that
matters.
i
saved
a
big
war.
i
saved
a
couple
of
them.
but
under
my
"administration,"
we
will
never
make
excuses
for
america's
"enemies,"
we
will
never
hesitate
in
defending
american
"lives,"
and
we
will
never
stop
working
to
defeat
radical
islamic
"terrorism,"
never.
and
nobody's
done
it
like
we've
done
it.
and
it's
"we,"
it's
we.
it's
not
"me,"
it's
we.
it's
a
whole
movement.
there
"has,"
by
the
"way,"
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
you
"know,"
"outside,"
i
don't
know
what
this
place
"holds,"
it's
like
"10,"
"11,000"
"people,"
right?
outside
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
that
want
to
get
in.
there's
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
there's
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
maybe
i'm
"wrong,"
but
this
is
bigger
than
it
was
in
"2016,"
because
in
2016
i
said
what
we're
going
to
"do,"
but
now
i've
completed
more
promises
than
i've
made.
i
"mean,"
i've
actually
completed
"more,"
right?
"like,"
as
an
"example,"
many
of
you
were
"here,"
look
at
all
those
beautiful
red
"hats,"
keep
america
"great,"
that's
good.
but
i
never
talked
"about,"
did
you
ever
hear
me
prior
to
the
election
talk
about
space
force?
i
never
talked
about
it.
we
did
space
"force,"
but
did
we
ever
speak
about
it?
no.
there
were
many
things
that
we've
done
that
we
never
spoke
"about,"
right?
right
to
"try,"
you
know
about
right
to
"try,"
right?
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
for
44
"years,"
right
to
try.
that's
people
that
are
very
"sick,"
terminally
"ill,"
and
they
can't
get
medicine
that
possibly
works.
and
very
"well,"
we
have
the
greatest
labs
and
the
greatest
doctors
in
the
"world,"
the
greatest
scientists
in
the
"world,"
we
have
the
greatest
medicines
in
the
world.
if
they
have
something
that
they're
pretty
sure
is
going
to
work
but
is
going
to
take
another
six
"years,"
i
brought
those
times
way
"back,"
by
the
"way,"
way
"down,"
but
they
would
travel
to
"asia,"
they
would
travel
to
"europe,"
they
would
travel
all
over
the
world
to
try
and
get
a
cure
because
we
wouldn't
sell
them
the
medicine
because
we
didn't
want
to
take
a
chance
on
making
the
people
sick.
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
they're
going
to
die.
they're
going
to
"die.\""
"\"well,"
"sir,"
we
can't
take
the
"liability.\""
i
"said,"
"\"then"
we'll
draw
up
a
statement
assessing
all
"liability,"
taking
all
liability
away
from
the
"country,"
away
from
the
insurance
"companies,"
away
from
the
healthcare
"companies,"
away
from
the
"doctors.\""
and
with
the
great
help
of
a
lot
of
incredible
"republicans,"
and
we
had
some
democrats
help
"us,"
we
passed
right
to
"try,"
and
you
have
to
see
how
this
works.
some
people
are
"being,"
many
people
are
being
saved.
and
you
"know,"
the
drug
companies
didn't
like
it
because
they
didn't
want
to
take
people
that
"sick,"
because
they
didn't
want
it
on
their
charts.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
understand
that.
we
won't
include
that.
we'll
have
a
separate
list
over
"here.\""
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
would
you
do
"that?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
i'll
do
"that,"
i'll
do
"that.\""
but
i
didn't
talk
about
right
to
try.
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
get
that
"done,"
we
got
it
done.
that
was
a
tough
one
to
get
done.
it
sounds
"simple,"
but
it
was
tough.
there's
nothing
easy
in
this
country.
you
"know,"
they
said
to
"me,"
a
friend
of
mine
the
other
"day,"
"\"who's"
the
toughest
country
to
deal
"with,"
"president?\""
he
used
to
call
me
donald.
i've
known
this
guy
for
a
long
time.
i'd
like
to
say
20
"years,"
but
it's
much
more
than
that.
i
just
don't
want
to
tell
you
how
"long,"
it's
too
long.
and
i
"said,"
"\"call"
me
donald.
you've
always
called
me
"donald.\""
"\"i"
"can't.\""
he
calls
me
mr.
president.
i've
known
this
guy
forever.
he
used
to
call
"me,"
"\"hey,"
"donald,"
let's
go
out
to
"dinner.\""
you
know
"before,"
he'd
"go,"
"\"hey,"
let's
go
out
to
"dinner.\""
now
he
"goes,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
"sir,"
how
are
"you?\""
right?
how
are
you?
but
what
we've
"done,"
and
he
"said,"
he
told
"me,"
"\"what"
you've
"done,"
we've
never
seen
anything
like
"it.\""
so
many
people
are
saying
that.
we
are
all
together
doing
"something,"
not
only
in
terms
of
the
"election,"
not
only
in
terms
of
what
we're
doing
right
now.
don't
"forget,"
it's
a
long
way
to
the
election.
you
"know,"
we
have
"what,"
10
months?
that's
a
long
way.
this
is
my
first
stop
of
the
"year,"
first
major
stop
of
the
year.
this
is
it.
and
we
start.
by
the
"way,"
let's
do
one
of
those
polls
right
"now,"
do
you
mind?
is
there
anything
more
fun
than
a
trump
rally?
here
we
are.
anything
more
fun
than
a
trump
rally?
here
we
are.
we
have
the
greatest
phrase
of
all
"time,"
make
america
great
"again,"
and
all
due
"respect,"
i'll
never
end
…
i'm
a
little
superstitious.
i'll
never
end
"it,"
make
america
great
"again,"
but
i
see
all
those
hats.
i
see
all
those
"hats,"
changing
it
a
little
"bit,"
but
make
america
great
again.
i
"said,"
you
"know,"
"today,"
we
just
hit
the
highest
stock
price
in
the
history
of
our
country.
your
401ks
are
at
"records,"
your
stocks
are
"great,"
but
what
it
really
means
to
me
is
"jobs,"
more
"importantly,"
than
anything
else.
we
have
the
best
"jobs,"
the
best
"everything,"
right?
we
just
hit
…
i
can't
really
"say,"
make
america
great
again.
our
military
is
"rebuilt,"
$2.5
trillion.
our
military
is
rebuilt.
we're
doing
great
numbers.
"economically,"
our
country
is
the
strongest
it's
ever
been.
you
have
factories
moving
back
into
ohio.
you
never
saw
anything
like
"it,"
right?
you
had
your
best
year.
when
i
say
make
america
great
"again,"
what
that
sort
of
means
is
we
didn't
get
"there,"
but
we
did
get
there.
"now,"
i
have
a
new
theme.
it's
called
keep
america
great.
keep
america
great.
"now,"
i'm
a
very
loyal
"person,"
and
i
am
concerned
about
changing
the
theme
because
make
america
great
again
i
think
was
the
greatest
political
campaign
in
history.
i
"mean,"
crooked
hillary
spent
three
or
four
times
more
money
than
i
have
spent.
crooked
"hillary,"
"wait,"
crooked
…
we
should
lock
her
"up,"
i'll
tell
you.
crooked
hillary
spent
three
or
four
times
more.
i
wanted
to
be
a
little
bit
…
i
have
to
"say,"
that
was
a
great
"campaign,"
and
i
don't
want
to
change
it.
i
don't
want
to
have
this
incredible
"2016,"
then
go
with
"something,"
and
if
something
ever
"happened,"
this
country
will
go
to
"hell,"
i
just
…
you
know
the
stocks
i'm
talking
"about,"
the
records.
you
don't
have
records
this
way.
you
have
records.
get
used
to
"it,"
because
if
that
"happened,"
you
will
see
things
happen
that
aren't
good.
"but,"
i
have
to
now
"say,"
do
i
want
to
change
the
greatest
theme
in
political
"history,"
make
america
great
"again,"
with
keep
america
"great,"
right?
let's
take
a
little
"applause,"
right?
we'll
go
make
america
great
"again,"
you'd
clap
if
you
want
that.
then
we
would
"go,"
keep
america
"great,"
you'd
clap
if
you
like
that.
"okay,"
are
you
ready?
"first,"
make
america
great
again.
ready?
keep
america
great.
you
"know,"
"that,"
i
call
that
a
free
poll.
that's
better
than
a
poll.
do
you
ever
see
these
crazy
polls
that
come
out?
we're
doing
great
in
the
"polls,"
by
the
way.
"remember,"
i
used
to
come
out
and
talk
about
the
polls?
we'll
start
doing
that
very
soon.
we're
doing
great
in
the
"polls,"
but
this
is
like
a
free
poll.
somebody
else
would
go
"out,"
they
have
all
this
money
that
they
"raised,"
and
they
give
somebody
$1
"million,"
and
they'll
ask
200
people
that
question.
"then,"
they'll
"say,"
"\"well,"
make
america
great
again
is
"better,\""
but
i
will
tell
"you,"
i
haven't
heard
one
thing
where
that
was
true.
with
all
of
these
…
i
would
have
"said,"
"instinctively,"
make
america
great
again
could
not
be
beaten.
i've
probably
done
this
10
times.
i
have
never
had
it
win.
it's
keep
america
"great,"
and
that's
what
we're
"doing,"
but
we're
going
to
use
both.
we're
going
to
use
both
…
good.
keep
america
great.
we're
going
to
use
"both,"
but
keep
america
great.
that's
probably
going
to
be
the
dominant
theme.
for
eight
"years,"
the
obama
administration
enabled
and
emboldened-
…
the
iranian
regime.
they
gave
iran
$150
"billion,"
including
$1.7
billion-
…
in
"hard,"
cold
cash.
can
you
imagine?
"no,"
"no,"
can
you
imagine?
$1.7
"billion,"
$1.8
billion
in
cash?
the
foolish
iran
nuclear
deal
financed
iranian
aggression
while
allowing
a
quick
path
to
nuclear
"breakout,"
that's
what
it
did.
by
the
"way,"
it
expires
so
soon.
they
can
have
nuclear
weapons.
they're
"not,"
as
i
said
"before,"
they
will
not
have
nuclear
weapons.
…
they
hit
us
with
16
"missiles,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
"many?\""
we
were
ready
to
go.
we
were
ready
to
go.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
many?
how
many
died?
how
many
were
"wounded?\""
"\"sir,"
"none.\""
none?
pretty
good
warning
"system,"
none.
how
many
were
hurt?
how
many
were
…
"none,"
sir.
"so,"
we
didn't
do
anything.
we
were
ready.
we
were
ready.
not
that
i
wanted
"to,"
but
we
were
ready.
you
have
no
idea.
a
lot
of
people
got
very
lucky.
…
we
have
a
lot
of
your
congressmen
right
now
in
congress.
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
should
we
come
with
"you?\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
stay
back
and
"vote.\""
they're
voting
on
some
pretty
important
"stuff,"
right?
"but,"
we
were
able
to
get
bill.
we
thank
"you,"
"bill,"
very
"much,"
great
"job,"
great
warrior.
thank
"you,"
bill.
ohio

more
money
in
the

"respected,"

thank
"you,"

"and,"
a
woman
who
really
has
become
a
great
friend
of
mine.
she
took
over
this
party.
we
fought
like
hell.
we
had
some
other
people
that
had
their
mind
on
taking
over
the
"party,"
but
they'd
never
had
a
chance
against
jane
"timken,"
jane.
"and,"
the
man
who
is
in
charge
of
my
campaign
in
"ohio,"
i
had
a
choice
of
five
people.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
like
this
guy's
"name.\""
i
don't
know
why.
his
name
is
bob
paduchik.
why
do
i
like
his
name?
i
said
"\"bob,"
how
are
we
"doing?\""
he
"said,"
"\"you're"
going
to
win
"big,"
"sir.\""
"because,"
you
"know,"
you
keep
"hearing,"
you
cannot
win
unless
you
win
the
great
state
of
ohio.
that's
these
guys.
"once,"
i
was
leading
ohio
by
a
lot
in
the
poll.
they
never
say
that
anymore.
it's
terrible.
they
were
saying
it
when
they
thought
i
wasn't
going
to
"win,"
but
we
were
ahead
right
from
the
beginning.
…
i
"said,"
"\"bob,"
let
me
ask
"you,"
just
out
of
"curiosity,"
i
don't
have
these
people.
the
leaders
are
not
with
us.
is
that
good
or
"bad?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
it's
great.
you
just
went
up
three
"points,"
would
you
believe
"this,"
by
not
having
"it?\""
he
"said,"
"\"don't"
"worry,"
"sir,"
you're
going
to
"win,\""
and
we
won
by
a
lot.
"now,"
i
understand
we're
up
by
a
lot
more
than
we
ever
thought
possible.
bob
was
fantastic.
thank
"you,"
bob.
…
"then,"
one
of
these
characters
back
"there,"
they
put
me
in
a
contest
with
the
late
great
abraham
"lincoln,"
right?
who
do
you
like
"better,"
trump
or
abraham
lincoln?
i
said
abraham
lincoln-
i
"said,"
who
do
you
like
better?
they
say
they
did
a
poll
on
this.
i
think
i
remember
the
numbers.
all
i
know
"is,"
we
won
against
"abraham,"
honest
abe.
we
"won,"
53
to
47.
can
you
believe
"that,"
abraham
lincoln?
i
went
back
to
the
first
"lady,"
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
i
just
beat
abraham
lincoln
in
a
"poll.\""
i
don't
know
if
they
had
polls
back
"then,"
but
abraham
lincoln.
i
always
say
i
can
be
more
presidential
than
any
candidate
that
ever
"ran,"
than
any
"president,"
other
than
maybe
abraham
lincoln
when
he's
wearing
his
hat.
i
like
abe
"lincoln,"
but
when
we're
doing
"well,"
we
have
a
lot
of
support.
do
you
know
why?
because
our
country
is
doing
so
well.
our
country
is
doing
so
well.
when
we
went
"out,"
we
"started,"
and
we
went
right
to
the
top
of
the
polls.
it
wasn't
like
these
folks
today.
they
are
"2%,"
"3%,"
but
they're
climbing.
we
went
right
to
the
top
from
day
one.
we
never
missed
center
stage
in
the
debates.
remember
those
great
debates?
we
actually
got
high
ratings.
they
don't
get
very
good
ratings
anymore.
they're
"like,"
it's
like
"death,"
watching.
i
should
watch.
you
"know,"
i'm
supposed
to
watch.
it's
like
my
job.
try
and
"watch,"
watch
the
"competition,"
but
it's
like
watching
death.
…
did
you
see
where
pocahontas
is
"slipping,"
badly?
"bernie,"
bernie
has
gone
up.
he's
"surging,"
"bernie's,"
crazy
"bernie,"
he's
"surging,"
and
biden
doesn't
know
the
difference
between
iran
and
iraq.
he's
gotten
it
wrong
four
times.
he
"goes,"
"\"when"
we
took
our
shot
at
iraq
"…\""
"no,"
"no,"
no.
they're
all
"saying,"
"\"no,"
"no,\""
they're
"screaming,"
"\"it's"
"iran,"
"iran.\""
what?
his
"son,"
right?
where's
"hunter,"
where
is
hunter?
"no,"
i
went
to
one
of
them.
i
"said,"
"\"we"
have
to
have
where
is
hunter
as
a
"witness.\""
they
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
"mean,"
where
is
"hunter?\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
his
first
name.
i
have
now
made
his
first
name
where's.
where's
"hunter?\""
here's
a
"guy,"
made
no
"money,"
got
thrown
out
of
the
military
"forces,"
i
think
the
"navy,"
got
thrown
"out,"
had
no
"job,"
had
no
"nothing,"
"so,"
he
went
from
that
to
making
millions
of
dollars
a
year
as
soon
as
sleepy
joe
became
vice
president.
he
made
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
would
anybody
in
this
room
do
that
for
millions
of
…
i
would.
he
made
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
ukraine
took
care
of
him.
how
about
china?
he
walked
out
with
$1.5
billion
to
"manage,"
and
he
never
did
it
before.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
oil
and
gas.
he
was
making
a
fortune.
"so,"
where
is
hunter?
where
the
hell
are
"you,"
hunter?
i'll
tell
"you,"
i
sort
of
hope
it's
"joe,"
because
he
will
hear
where's
hunter
every
single
"debate,"
nine
times
a
debate.
where
is
hunter?
…
howdy
doody.
the
problem
"is,"
a
lot
of
people
don't
remember
alfred
e.
neuman.
don't
say
that.
you
look
much
younger
than
"that,"
i
must
say.
you
have
mayor
pete.
i
"mean,"
give
me
a
break.
can
you
believe
mayor
pete?
this
is
going
to
be
the
president
of
the
united
states?
how
would
he
be
against
negotiating
against
president
xi
of
china?
we
just
made
one
hell
of
a
deal.
you're
going
to
see
the
numbers
very
"soon,"
you
know?
one
hell
of
a
deal.
they
didn't
like
those
tariffs.
thanks
to
republican
"leadership,"
america
is
winning
"again,"
and
"america,"
most
"importantly,"
is
respected
"again,"
respected
like
never
before.
you
"know,"
for
"years,"
nato
has
taken
advantage
of
the
united
states.
we
protect
europe
from
"russia,"
and
the
numbers
have
been
going
down
for
"many,"
many
"years,"
15
"years,"
18
years.
the
numbers
is
like
a
roller
coaster
down.
i
went
"over,"
and
i
said
"\"folks,"
you
got
to
pay
your
bills.
you're
delinquent.
you're
"delinquent.\""
"then,"
they
don't
like
me.
they
"say,"
"\"we"
like
obama
"better.\""
they
should
like
obama
better.
obama
would
go
in
and
"say,"
"\"thank"
you
very
much
for
coming.
we
appreciate
it.
"bye-bye,"
i'm
going
back
to
washington.
i'm
going
back.
i'll
be
violating
the
carbon

i'm
going
to

to
play
"golf.\""
i
drive
to
play
a
round
of
golf
at
the
course
i
"own,"
it
doesn't
even
cost
them
anything.
he
flies
to
"hawaii,"
nobody
cares.
if
i
drive
20
"minutes,"
it's
"like,"
"\"donald"

is
playing

he
violates
the

of

a
great
congressman
from
"tennessee,"
they
have
…
it's
a
great
state.
they
have
early
"voting,"
very
early
"voting,"
probably
the
earliest.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know.
i
just
left

this
was
in
november.
this
was
the
"election,"

"said,"
"\"i"

love

"sir,"
we've
seen
lines
of
people
that
didn't
vote
"before,"
because
they
never
were
inspired
to
"vote,\""
and
these
are
people
that
never

they
have

on

over

never

hate
to
tell
"you,"

going

that's
what
"happened,"
right?
that's
happened.
you
did
it.
you
did

i
think
we're
going

even
bigger

i'll
tell
you
"what,"
we're
a
long

from

are
bigger

were

really

"know,"

"\"i"

more

turned

look
at
what
she's
"saying,"
the
"lies,"

see
it
all.

are
going

"think,"

could
it

be

this
is
what
happened.
"probably,"
it's
the
number
one
reason
i'm
running.
america
lost
"60,000"
factories
under
the
previous
"administration,"
"60,000."
you
wouldn't
believe
that
it's
"possible,"

i
know
it's
"true,"
because
i've
said
it
50
"times,"

back
"there,"

never
corrected
me.

think
of

went

went

a
look
at

put

you
wouldn't

could

short
period

we've
added
"12,000"
brand
new
"factories,"
and
many
more
are
coming
in.
one
of
the
reasons
they're
coming
in
is
we've
eliminated

of

killing

the

the
"$10,000,"

includes
what
we've

i'm
adding

there
the

are

"know,"
there's
a
state
known
as
"texas,"

i
won
texas
by
a

just
like
i
won
ohio
by
a
lot.
how
would
you
like
to
go
into

"say,"

"way,"

don't
want

about

that
says
"that,"
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
the
end

"remember,"
he
had
the
cover
of
the

i
won't
mention
the
"magazine,"
sleazebag

he
was
born
to
be
"president,"
and
right
after
"that,"
he
came
tumbling
"down,"
but
he's
from
"texas,"
so
he
was
against
"religion,"
he
was
against
"oil,"
and
he
was
against
guns.
abraham
lincoln
could
not
win
in
texas
with
that
platform.
that's
not
a
good
platform.
it's
not
a
good
"platform,"
but
you
have
people
that
want
to
shut
down
the
oil
industry.
if
you
do
"that,"
you're
going
to
shut
down
half
your
businesses.
it's
really
more
than
"that,"
and
the
rest
of
them
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
pay
because
the
cost
of
this
energy
would
be
so
expensive.
we
have
all
forms
of

we
have
every
form
of
"energy,"

we
are
doing

want
to
cripple

our

can't
say

you
"know,"

hundred

was

"here,"

i
assume
that
"2,"
300

ago
was
"cleaner,"
probably.
you
never
"know,"
but
our
water
and
our
air
is
as
clean
as
it's
ever
"been,"
and
i
took

out
of

horrible

always
"say,"

don't

saved
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
that
was
put
in
there
to
hurt
"us,"
in
my
opinion.
it
was
put
in
there
to
hurt
us.
we
were
paying
money
to
india.
we
were
paying
money
to
china.
china's
didn't
kick
in
until
"2030,"
we
kicked
in
immediately.
we
had
to
pay
money.
russia
kicked
"in,"
in
20
…
let's
"see,"
they
kicked
in
before.
they
were
"1990,"
"wait,"
they
were
1996.
that
was
a
very
dirty
period
of
"air,"
"so,"
they
didn't
have
…
we
kick
in
"now,"
and
"that,"
it's
just
unacceptable.
we
would
have
spent
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars.
we
would
have
had
to
close
"up,"
i
"think,"
at
least
25%
to
30%
of
our
businesses.
who
the
hell
would
make
a
deal
like
"that,"
right?
who
would
make
a
deal
like
that?
"no,"
how
unfair.
you
look
at
russia.
you
look
at
china.
you
look
at
india.

all
got
these
massive
breaks.
we
got
no
"breaks,"
and
we're
paying
money.
i
say
sometimes
to
"france,"
"\"how"
are
the
yellow
vests
working
"out?\""
because
they
don't
like
raising
their
taxes
and
sending
the
money
to
faraway
places
that
they'd
never
heard
of.
"so,"
we
are
in
good
shape.
it
took
a
certain
amount
of
courage
to
do
that.
i
said
i'm
going
to
get
killed
on
this
"one,"
and
you
know
what?
i
did
"it,"
and
i
was
"applauded,"
because
the
people
get
it.
the
people
know
what
we're
"doing,"
and
they're
tired
of
being
ripped
off
by
the
rest
of
the
world.
they're
tired
of
being
ripped
off
by
the
rest
of
the
world.
…
i
immediately
canceled
the
obama
administration's
job-killing
"catastrophe,"
which
would
have
dealt
a
death
blow
to
the
united
states
auto
"industry,"
the
transpacific
partnership.
it
was
a
disaster.
that
was
going
to
be
worse
than
nafta.
"nafta,"
i
always
"say,"
the
world's
worst
deal.
i
think
that
would
have
been
worse.
it
would
have
taken
the
car
industry.
it
would
have
taken
many
of
your
industries.
that
was
a
setup
for
the
united
states
to
get
fleeced.
…
that's
going
to
"include,"
because
we
take
care
of
our
great
auto
workers
of
"toledo,"
the
home
of
jeep.
how
good
is
jeep?
i've
taken
the
toughest-ever
action
against
china's
chronic
trade
"abuses,"
including
tariffs
on
$370
billion
worth
of
chinese
made
"goods,"
bringing
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
into
our
treasury.
i
gave
some
of
that
"money,"
because
they
were
"targeted,"
to
our
"farmers,"
and
our
farmers
did
just
fine.
"now,"
the
deal
is
"done,"
and
the
other
deals
are
"done,"
and
the
farmers
are
doing
very
well.
we
love
our
"farmers,"
and
they
never
complain.
they
never
complain.
you
"know,"
when
they'd
"go,"
the
fake
news
back
"there,"
they'd
go
and
they'd
talk-
and
when
they
"come,"
the
fake
news
"back,"
they
go
and
talk
to
the
farmers.
"\"what"
do
you
think
of
president
trump?
china
is
deciding
not
to
buy
anymore
of
"this.\""
you
know
what
the
farmers
would
"say,"
"\"we're"
going
to
have
to
suffer
for
a
while
because
there's
china
and
there's
other
nations
have
been
ripping
us
off
for
years.
the
president
is
right
and
we're
with
the
"president.\""
how
great?
how
great?
but
our
strong
action
paid
off
and
we'll
sign
that
terrific
and
fully
enforceable
phase
one
trade
deal
with
china.
and
"again,"
we're
keeping
the
tariffs
on
because
we
use
that
for
other
money.
we
are
taking
billions.
remember
what
i
said?
we're
not
paying
for
it.
because
china
devalued
their
currency
and
then
they
put
a
lot
of
money
into
the
pot.
we're
not
paying
for
it.
and
now
they're
starting
to
"say,"
"\"i"
guess
he
was
"right.\""
and
our
trade
"deficit,"
as
a
"result,"
has
"come,"
has
really
come
substantially
down.
it
was
just
in
the
papers
today.
the
trade
deficit
has
come
down.
as
a
result
of
our
"actions,"
steel
mills
all
across
"ohio,"
you
know
this
better
than
i
"do,"
are
roaring
back
to
life!
jsw

is
investing
five

think
of
that.
i
think
you
do.
the
steel
industry
was
dead
and
now
it's
vibrant.
all
"told,"
american
steel
companies
are
currently
making
13
billion
dollars
worth
of
new
investments
all
across
our
nation.
think
of
that.
they
weren't
investing
25
cents.
the
industry
was
dead.
now
it's
vibrant.
after
years
of
rebuilding
other
"nations,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
nation.
we
are
finally
putting
america
first!
but
while
we
are
creating
jobs
and
killing
"terrorists,"
the
washington
democrats
are
wasting
america's
time
with
demented
hoaxes
and
crazy
witch
hunts.
think
of
it.
the
day
they
came
down
that
escalator
it
started.
who
the
hell
else
could
they
take
in
this
stuff?
right?
can
i
get
some
credit
for
that?
most
guys
would
have
been
in
a
corner
with
their
thumb
in
their
mouth
"saying,"
"\"mommy,"
"mommy,"
take
me
"home.\""
these
are
bad
people.
the
democrat
politicians
we're
fighting
today
are
the
same
ones
who
took
a
sledgehammer
to
ohio
jobs
in
factories.
they
destroyed
your
factories.
they
destroyed
your
jobs.
but
they're
losing
and
we're
winning
and
america's
comeback
continues
full
speed
ahead.
on
no
issue
have
democrat
politicians
more
clearly
betrayed
the
american
people
than
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration.
far
left
radical
politicians
support
deadly
sanctuary
cities
and
demonstrated
their
"contempt,"
"scorn,"
and
disdain
for
everyday
americans
and
the
american
family.
these
jurisdictions
release
dangerous
violent
criminal

out

and
directly
onto

streets

they
are
free
to
"rob,"
"attack,"

kill

stop

can
you
believe
it?
and
because
of

they
want
open

they
want

innocent

are
being
brutalized

murdered
by
illegal
alien

as
just
one
example
right
here
in
"ohio,"
you
all
know
about
"it,"
an
illegal
alien
went
on
a
deadly
crime
"spree,"
attempting
to
rape
a
14-year-old
girl.
then
raping
an
murdering
a
60-year

then
shooting
at

took
a

through

was
walking
with
her

and
finally
the

came.
we
love
our

they
were
able
to
apprehend
this
terrible
criminal.

to

they're
the
worst…

allowed

"out,"

they
kill
them
with
machetes.
you
know
why?
because
it's
more
painful
than
using
a

federal

recently
discovered

rounded
up

than
25
ms-13

are

they
want
to
call

the

that's
what

if
i

i

i'd
like

i
like

but
democrats
stand
for
"crime,"
"corruption,"
and
chaos.
republicans
stand
for
"law,"
"order,"
and
justice.
that's
really
the
way
it
is.
we
side
with

with

we
are
removing

from

we
are
sending

and
we
will
no

and
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
a
lot
of
things
are
happening.
you're
going
to
hear
about
that
in
two

to

catch

"release,"
you
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
we
catch
them.
we
take
down
their
name
and
we
release
them.
what
kind
of
crap
is
that?
these
are
the
policies
that
we
inherited.
you
catch
"somebody,"
take
their

"\"please"
come

right?
and
we're
releasing

and
if

don't
do
that
everybody
gets

can
you

how
about
that

it's
called

how
about
this?
they
put
their

these
people
are
going
to
america.

i
will
not
use
names
because
i'll
be
accused
of
something
later.
but
from
"honduras,"
what
about
it?
el
"salvador,"
we
have…
he's
good.
only
in
ohio
can
that
happen.
who's
the
man
that
did
that?
who
is
that?
so
"anyway,"
"but,"
in
"honduras,"
guatemala
they
have
like
this
lottery.
now
the
"people,"
i've
gotten
to
know
the
government
officials.
they're
good.
they've
made
some
good
things.
they
"said,"
"\"hey"
we
need
to
take
our
people
"back.\""
they're
getting
their
people
back.
"before,"
they
wouldn't
take
them
back.
they'd
send
them
here
to
go
into
our
county.
we'd
bring
them
back
under
past
administrations
and
then
after
"that,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"we're"
not
taking
them
back.
we're
not
taking
them
back.
take
them
the
hell
our
of
here.
we're
not
letting
you
land
your
"plane.\""
so
we
have
the
government
flying
the
plane
all
over
trying
to
get
a
couple
"prisoners,"
bad
people
back.
now
they
take
them
back.
you
know
why?
because
we
"said,"
"\"look,"
if
you
don't
take
them
"back,"
we're
going
to
put
tariffs
on
every
single
thing
you
"sell.\""
now
they
"say,"
"\"we'd"
love
to
take
them
back.
we'd
love
to
take
them
back.
we'll
take
them
back
"gladly,"
"sir.\""
"no,"
they
couldn't
get
them
back.
we'd
take
off
with
these
absolutely
gang
members
an
we'd
bring
them
back
and
they
wouldn't
accept
them.
we
couldn't
land
the
plane.
we
couldn't
get
anything
through
the
border.
it
comes
through
the
border
this
"way,"
not
that
way.
but
now
they
take
them
back.
they've
been
good
actually.
they've
been
very
good.
now
we
paid
them
a
lot
of
money.
we
paid
them
500
million
dollars
a
year.
can
you
believe
we
paid
them
500
million
through
el
salvador?
and
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
there's
not
going
to
be
any
money
anymore
because
you're
not
treating
us
"right.\""
and
they've
been
good.
they've
been
great.
they
take
them
back.
"\"how"
many
would
you
like
us
to
take?
we'll
take
as
many
as
you
"want.\""
and
here's
the
big
thing.
ready?
you
ready?
today
in
the
newspapers
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
we
won't
the
big
big
beautiful
lawsuit
when
they
were
all
suing
us.
the
wall
is
being
built.
we
built
it.
we
built
already
a
tremendous
amount.
but
we're
releasing
four
million
dollars
of
military
construction
funds
to
build
the
biggest
section
of
the
wall.
it's
literally
being
signed
now
and
will
be
under
construction
very
shortly
in
couple
of
weeks.
and
we've
already
built
over
a
100
miles
of
wall.
how
about
that?
100
miles.
and
by
the
end
of
next
"year,"
we're
going
to
have
a
lo
more
built.
and
it's
already
having
a
big
impact.
how
about
"that,"
democrats?
"\"walls"
don't
work.
we
want
"technology.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
want
to
"do?\""
they
want
drones.
"oh,"
good.
when
people
are
"rushing,"
the
"caravans,"
when
they're
"rushing,"
having
a
drone
flying
around
is
not
going
to
help
you
do
it.
okay?
nothing
like…
you
know
five
years
"ago,"
the
democrats
all
wanted
a
wall.
they
just
could
never
get
i
built.
they
didn't
know
how
the
hell
to
build
it.
i
do.
so
we
built
100
miles.
i
think
probably
more
than
that
now.
we
have
a
lot
under
contract.
but
we
won
our
big
case
just…
i
woke
up.
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
good
news.
they
overturned
a
horrible
decision
from
the
lower
court.
you
can
now
fund
the
rest
of
the
"wall.\""
i
"said,"
"\"thank"
you
very
"much.\""
thank
"you,"
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
changed
some.
they
want
crime.
they
want
gangs.
i'm
saying
all
this
stuff
and
then
i
"say,"
"\"gee,"
now
i
sort
of
understand
why
they
hate
"me.\""
right?
but
it's
true.
it's
true.
their
policies
are
a
disaster.
they're
bad
politicians
and
they're
horrible
policies
but
what
they
do
is
they
stick
together
and
then
they're
vicious.
they're
"vicious,"
horrible
people.
i
didn't
say
that.
they're
horrible
people.
what
they
do
to
people
is
as
disgrace
but
they
stick
together
left
their
party
and
joined
our
party.
but
we've
done
things
nobody's
ever
done
before.
but
the
democrats
are
taking
their
cues
from
socialist
bernie
sanders
and
that
group.
"omar,"
"aoc,"
talib.
this
is
a
jihadist
"woman,"
talib.
talib.
"boy,"
what
a
group
but
they're
the
leaders
of
the
party.
they're
really
my
opinion
dealers.
that's
what
happened.
that's
how
they
got
into
this
impeachment
on
this.
the
leaders
of
the
party
are…
there's
"aoc,"
"talib,"
and
omar.
and
pelosi
beats
them
but
she
shakes
and
quivers
and
she's
very
soft.
but
you
know
who
the
leader
of
your
party
is?
all
of
you.
you.
you're
the
leader
of
your
party.
everybody
believed
me.
then
she
went
down.
then
she
started
coming
up
and
then
he
went
down.
it
doesn't
help
me
to
do
it
a
year-and-a-half
before
the
election.
that's
"why,"
like
with
the
green
new
"deal,"
okay?
i
want
to
say
great
things
about
it.
okay?
i
don't
want
to
knock
it
and
then
"say,"
"\"oh,"
we're
not
going
to
use
"that.\""
i
like
it
when
they
"say,"
"\"you"
no
longer
can
fly
airplanes.
no
longer
can
you
have
any
cows
in
meadows.
right?
no
longer
can
you
do
"anything.\""
we
can't
do
anything
anymore.
the
green
"deal,"
i
love
it.
i
think
it's
great.
it
should
be
debated.
it
should
be
debated
rally
it's
a
month
before.
you'll
get
to
hear
the
real
facts.
but
i'm
tired
of
talking
about
this
10
months
before
the
election.
they
can
do
more
with
the
tape
than
they
can
do
with
a
newspaper.
"no,"
they'll
do
it.
you'll
see
it.
somewhere
you'll
see
"it,"
"\"trump"
supports
his
"plan.\""
they
are
sick.
republicans
will
defend
middle
class
taxpayers
and
the
right
to
keep
the
doctor
of
your
choice.
we
will
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions.
and
we
will
protect
your
pre-existing
physician.
you'll
have
your
physician.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
that
is
why
i
have
asked
congress
to
prohibit
late-term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
radical
democrats
now
have
a
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
we
still
have
the
american
dream.

we're
aggressively
combating
the
opioid
epidemic
and
it's
bad.
in
"2018,"
drug
overdose
deaths
in
ohio
fell
by…
listen
to
this…
22%.
that's
not
good
enough
but
credit
to
opioid.
and
as
we
continue
rebuilding
our
"military,"
we
have
the
star
legendary
army
tank
factory
in
lima.
and
we've
authorized
441
new
striker
fighting
combat
vehicles
and
453
new
abrams
tanks
to
be
built
in
the
buckeye
state.
that's
a
lot
of
tanks.
so
"wait,"
just
a
quick
story.
okay?
i'm
proud
of
this.
so
they
had
this
army
tank
"plant,"
"right,"
in
lima.
and
i
said
"\"what's"
going
"on?\""
"\"they're"
closing
"it.\""
"\"oh.\""
"\"they're"
closing.
they're
closing
"everything.\""
when
i
came
they
wanted
to
close
everything.
so
i
was
president-elect
i
think
right
around
at
that
time.
and
i
went
to
lima
and
went
through
the
factory
where
they
make
these
"trucks,"
the
plant.
and
they
make
the
tanks.
they
make
all
of
these
army
vehicle.
and
i
"said,"
"\"these"
people
are
amazing.
you
could
never
close
this.
you
could
never
re-open
it
"again.\""
they'd
been
doing
this
for
many
many
decades
and
this
factory
was
incredible.
and
i
looked
at
the
tanks
they
made.
they're
the
best
in
the
world
by
abrams.
they're
the
best
in
the
world.
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
if
you
close
"this,"
we're
not
going
to
be…
where
are
you
going
to
build
tanks?
this
is
the
primary
factory
in
the
whole
country.
i
think
it
might
be
the
only
factory
in
the
whole
"country.\"?"
"\"please"
send
us
200
"tanks.\""
"\"we"
don't
want
to
send
you
any
tanks
because
we're
going
to
kick
your
"ass.\""
we're
going
to
make
our
own
tanks.
right?
we've
got
to
make
our
own
tanks.
so
i
did
"something,"
based
on
my
instinct
because
instinct
sometimes
works
better
than
anything
else.
based
on
my
"instinct,"
i
"said,"
"\""
you
can't
close
this
"plant.\""
i
went
through
that
plant.
i
spent
"two,"
three
hours
talking
to
people
who
worked
there.
i
looked
at
some
of
the
hydraulic
and
"i'm,"
i
love
all
in
the
"world,"
"tractors,"
all
of
that
stuff.
i
know
a
lot
about
it.
and
i
looked
at
the
carvings.
i
looked
at
the
metal.
i
looked
at
how
perfect
everything
was
that
turns
around.
how
perfect
it
fit.
they
put
it
on
and
it
would
fit
like
within
1/100th
of
an
inch.
and
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
this
anyplace
"else.\""
i
"said,"
"\"and"
we're
going
to
be
expanding
our
military.
we're
going
to
be
rebuilding.
who
the
hell's
going
to
make
our
tanks
if
you
"close?\""
i
"said,"
"\"keep"
it
"open.\""
i
"actually,"
it
was
all
closed.
is
there
anybody
from
lima?
is
that
a
true
story?
right?
it
was
closed.
they
announced
it
was
closed.
it
was
all
set
to
close.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
can't
close
this
"plant.\""
and
now
"look,"
the
numbers
i
just
gave
you.
we're
making
almost
500
new
tanks.
you
could've
never
reopened
a
place
like
that.
it's
incredible.
and
you
could've
never
gotten
those
workers.
they're
really
skilled
people
and
if
you
did
it
would
cost
you
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
to
do
it.
it
wouldn't
have
been
as
good
as
we
have.
so
that
was
something
i
did
that
i'm
very
proud
of
because
i
really
over-rode
a
lot
of
talented
people
that
wanted
it
to
close.
i
recognized
israel's
true
capitol
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
we
further
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
"heights,"
52
years.
for
years
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
great
people
of
ohio.
and
saying
our
present
battle
is
the
survival
of
the
american
nation.
if
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
blessings
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
and
died
"for,"
and
fought
so
hard
to
"secure,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
in
2020.
we
have
to
win.
you
"know,"
we
have
to
win.
because
all
of
these
things
that
we've
done
can
be
undone.
and
you
can
have
a
country
that
goes
to
hell
very
very
"fast,"
very
very
fast.
only
in
this
way
can
we
save
the
america
we
love
and
drain
the
washington
swamp
once
and
for
all.
and
i
have
seen
that
dirty
rotten
swamp
better
than
anybody
else
in
america.
a
lot
of
crooked
"people,"
disgusting
crooked
people.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
phrase
made
in
the
u.s.a.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
nobody
knew
that.
it
could've
been
done
long
before
i
got
here.
they
had
the
technology.
but
we're
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
within
10
years.
isn't
that
amazing?
whoever
thought
that
was
possible?
who
would
have
thought
that's
possible?
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
and
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
big
beautiful
america.
we
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
bureaucracy
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
will
always
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
"\"in"
god
we
"trust.\""
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
generations
of
ohio
patriots
who
gave
their
"blood,"
"sweat,"
and
tears
for
this
beloved
nation.
from
cleveland
to
"cincinnati,"
from
dublin
to
"dayton,"
and
from
columbus
to
"toledo,"
this
state
is
the
home
of
proud
families
and
"farmers,"
and
"miners,"
and
"manufacturers,"
and
"aviators,"
and
astronauts.
ohio
is
where
the
wright
brothers
invented
the
airplane
and
where
annie
oakley
got
her
gun.
ohio
is
the
state
that
gave
us
american
legends
and
american
heroes
like
thomas
"edison,"
neil
"armstrong,"
and
the
great
john
glenn.
ohio
is
the
place
where
strong
american
workers
mined
"coal,"
worked
the
"railroads,"
and
forged
the
steel
that
made
america
into
the
greatest
most
powerful
nation
in
the
history
of
the

and
we
are
making
it
greater
than
ever
before.
proud
citizens
like
you
helped
build
this
country
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
with
your
"help,"
your
"devotion,"
and
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"fighting,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"

we
are
one

is
thriving
like
never
before.
and
ladies

the

is

we

"[wow,"

hello
to

and
a
load
to

i'm
thrilled
to
be
back
in

with
thousands
of
"hardworking,"

…
days
from
now.
can
you
believe
"it,"
43
days?
we
go
to
again
win
ohio.
i
understand
from
bob
"paduchik,"
you
know
bob?
that
we're
going
to
win
it
by
more
than
we
did.
whether
we
win
at
"nine,"
we
won
by
nine
points.
i
just
came
into
that
"big,"
beautiful
place.
it's
got
more
televisions
in
any
plane
in
history.
they've
got
televisions
and
closets
and
bathrooms
on
the
"floor,"
on
the
ceilings.
i
just
saw
that
we're
tied
in
ohio.
i
don't
think
so
…
president
trump
may
have
a
slim
lead
in
ohio?
they're
not
even
campaigning
in
"ohio,"
come
to
think
of
it.
"now,"
they're
fake
polls.
they're
almost
as
fake
as
the
writers
themselves.
they're
all
fake.
remember
last
time
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
he's
going
to
lose
"ohio.\""
we
won
by
nine
points.
"so,"
we
had
seven
swing
states
last
time.
president
trump
is
going
to
go
home
"early,"
but
it
wasn't
president
at
that
"time,"
it
was
just
donald
trump.
he
will
go
home
early.
we
did.
that
we
went
home
early
as
"victors,"
but
we
had
nine
states.
they
had
one
of
the
crazy
"papers,"
new
york
times.
they
hired
that
guy.
they
paid
him
millions
because
he
never
predicted
wrong.
he
was
wrong.
i
don't
know
if
they
had
a
contract
where
they
could
fire
"him,"
but
they
hired
this
guy.
we
had
nine
states.
i
was
down
at
all
of
them
on
the
day
of
election.
i
was
going
to
lose
all
"nine,"
and
then
guess
what?
i
won
every
one
of
them.
fake
polls.
they're
fake
polls.
then
we
have
a
crowd
like
this.
i
don't
know.
"look,"
the
"cameras,"
are
you
turning
around?
these
guys
are
bad
people.
i
swear.
they
never
turn
the
cameras
"around,"
ever.
turn
them
around.
turn
them
around.
they
never
"tell,"
look
at
them.
it's
just
like
a
bunch
of
stiffs.
real
stiffs.
why
don't
you
turn
the
cameras
around
for
once?
you
look
back
"there,"
you
can't
see
it.
there's
got
to
"be,"
feels
like
madison
square
garden
on
the
ground
except
we
have
more
people.
oh
"boy,"
it's
always
tough.
you
"know,"
we
go
through
this
all
the
time.
we're
always
asking
"them,"
look
at
these
crowds.
i
"mean,"
as
"far,"
you
can't
see
it.
you
have
this
prime
"territory,"
like
you
should
be
in
the
real
estate
business.
"now,"
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
back
"there,"
the
cameras
"don't,"
they
don't
get
it.
you
only
hear
it
from
the
sound.
i
go
home.
i
say
to
the
first
"lady,"
"\"did"
you
see
that
crowd
we
had
tonight
in
"ohio?\""
she
"goes,"
"\"no,"
no.
they
just
keep
it
on
your
"face.\""
that
includes
fox.
they
just
keep
it
"here,"
right
here.
they
don't
want
to
show.
you
know
what
they
don't
know
and
what
they
don't
get
is
that
showing
this
kind
of
activity
is
a
good
thing
for
them.
it's
positive
for
their
ratings.
it's
really
a
good
"thing,"
but
they
don't
want
to
do
"it,"
but
i
give
up
on
it.
you
know
what
you
do?
you
hear
it
because
you
can't
have
…
you
know
when
sleepy
joe
"biden,"
he's
got
the
circles.
you
knowthose
big
circles?
you
know
why
he
has
the
circles?
he's
got
four
of
"them,"
because
they
can't
…
i
"mean,"
think
of
it.
he
is
a
guy
who's
failed
every
time
he
ran.
we
called
him
1%
joe
and
now
he's
shot
and
he
got
their
nomination.
how
the
hell
does
that
work
out?
how
does
that
work
out?
but
he's
got
the
circles.
he
got
like
"four,"
sometimes
he
has
six
because
that's
a
good
way
of
"saying,"
if
you
don't
have
any
"people,"
just
put
them
in
the
circle
and
he's
practicing
the
science.
now
it
doesn't
work
"out,"
but
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
we're
doing
things
that
nobody's
ever
done
before.
we're
doing
what
nobody's
ever
"done,"
and
thank
you
for
being
here.
i
wish
we
could
move
the
press
back
"further,"
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth.
as
our
nation
mourns
the
loss
of
supreme
court
justice
…
thank
you
everybody.
thank
you.
so
is
our
nation
mourns
the
loss
of
supreme
court
justice
ruth
bader
"ginsburg,"
i
will
soon
announce
a
nominee
for
the
united
states
supreme
court.
they
say
it's
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
do.
i
don't
know.
i
think
"military,"
maybe.
we
rebuilt
your
military
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollars.
great.
we
will
fill
that
seat.
it's
going
to
go
quickly.
probably
announced
the
person.
i
don't
want
to
make
the
men
too
angry.
it
will
be
a
woman.
is
that
okay?
i
don't
want
to
have
a
problem
with
men.
they'll
say
trump
is
doing
very
poorly
with
men.
you
listen.
how's
he
doing?
"well,"
he's
doing
very
poorly
with
"men,"
with
women.
he's
doing
very
poorly
with
the
black
"community,"
hispanic
community.
then
you
have
the
election
night
doing
very
poorly
with
those
with
"diploma,"
without
"diploma,"
"college,"
phds.
what's
he
doing
well?
oh
"no,"
it's
going
to
be
a
very
short
night.
then
they
say
donald
trump
is
the
projected
winner
by
a
lot.
they
"say,"
"well,"
what
happened
is
he
did
very
well
with
women
did
very
well
with
"men,"
diplomas.
he
did
well
with
african
american
community.
by
the
"way,"
we
are
doing
really
well
with
the
african
american
"community,"
with
the
hispanic
community.
we're
doing
well
with
women.
we're
doing
very
well.
we're
doing
well
with
"suburbia,"
suburbia.
i
ended
a
regulation
that
will
destroy
suburbia.
if
biden
got
"in,"
they
will
destroy
the
suburbia.
we
call
it
suburbia
of
the
world
and
we
love
it.
i
know
it
"well,"
westchester
"county,"
the
"suburban,"
they
"sometimes,"
if
you
say
suburban
"housewife,"
you're
in
deep
trouble.
so
what
you
do
is
you
say
suburban
"women,"
they
love
me.
you
know
why?
they
want
security
and
they
don't
want
projects
being
right
next
to
their
house.
that's
okay.
they
don't
want
it.
by
the
"way,"
that
includes
minorities.
because
29%
to
30%
of
these
suburban
communities
are
minorities.
that
includes
them.
they
don't
want
that.
they
want
safe
communities.
they
want
great
communities.
they
don't
want
to
lose
the
american
dream.
it's
very
simple.
i
got
rid
of
the
regulation
from
obama-
biden
that
was
destroying
suburbia.
okay?
destroying
it.
i
think
suburbia
has
got
to
wake
up
because
if
they
get
"in,"
you
know
who's
in
charge?
you
know
who's
in
charge
of
the
program?
cory
"booker,"
cory
booker.
cory
booker.
"so,"
i
think
the
suburban
women
and
suburban
men
and
husbands
and
wives
and
"everybody,"
you
better
get
smart
because
you're
not
going
to
have
your
dream
very
much
longer
if
they
get
in.
if
i
get
"in,"
you've
got
it.
you've
also
got
your
second
amendment
if
i
get
it.
in
"2018,"
we
expanded
the
senate
majority.
"remember,"
they
"said,"
first
of
"all,"
i
wasn't
running.
i
wasn't
running.
it
makes
a
difference.
wait
you
see
what
happens.
we're
going
to
take
back
the
house.
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
this
crazy
nancy
pelosi.
kevin
mccarthy's
done
a
great
job.
we're
going
to
take
back
the
house.
people
are
so
tired
of
her.
people
are
so
tired.
did
you
hear
today?
the
latest.
"so,"
they
impeached
me
for
perfect
phone
call.
perfect.
it
was
a
perfect
phone
call.
now
they
want
to
impeach
me
again
if
i
nominate
somebody
as
i'm
constitutionally
obligated
to
"do,"
to
serve
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
go
ahead
and
i
want
them
to
do
that.
i
want
them
to
do
that.
we
will.
we
will.
we
will.
if
he
puts
forth
a
highly
qualified
"candidate,"
we
will
impeach
him.
"well,"
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
i'm
the
only
guy
in
the
world
that
could
get
impeached
for
trying
to
fill
a
seat
in
the
"supreme.\""
"so,"
we're
going
to
put
up
our
nominee
who's
going
to
be
outstanding.
we're
looking
at
five
incredible
"jurists,"
five
incredible
"people,"
women
that
are
extraordinary
in
every
way.
i
"mean,"
"honestly,"
it
could
be
anyone.
i
"mean,"
we're
going
to
be
announcing
it
on
friday
or
saturday.
"again,"
they
say
it's
the
most
important
thing
and
think
of
it.
so
in
a
single
"term,"
single
"term,"
by
the
end
of
our
"term,"
we
will
have
nominated
and
had
confirmed
i
think
it'll
end
up
being
over
300
federal
judges
and
hopefully
three
supreme
court
justices.
think
of
that.
three.
some
"presidents,"
they
never
get
any.
they
last
a
long
"time,"
a
lot
of
presidents
get
none.
we've
had
three.
it's
blowing
their
minds.
it's
blowing
their
"minds,"
but
for
the
people
of
"ohio,"
this
is
what
you
want.
"so,"
it
looks
like
we're
going
to
have
three
and
it's
going
to
be
very
exciting.
it's
exciting
even
from
me.
i'm
going
to
look
forward
to
it.
probably
"saturday,"
we
will
announce
the
nominee
and
it's
somebody
that
you're
going
to
have
great
respect
"for,"
great
respect.
thank
you.
big
stuff.
that's
a
big
thing.
they
set
the
course
of
our
country
for
many
years
to
"come,"
whether
it's
on
life
or
the
second
amendment
or
so
many
other
"things,"
they
set
the
whole
course
of
the
country.
very
important
"position,"
the
most
important.
joe
biden
has
refused
to
list
the
names
of
his
potential
justices
because
he
knows
they're
too
extreme
to
withstand
any
form
of
public
review.
if
joe
biden
and
the
democrats
take
"power,"
they
will
pack
the
supreme
court
with
far
left
radicals
who
will
unilaterally
transform
american
society
far
beyond
recognition.
they
will
mutilate
the
largest
figure
the
constitution
and
oppose
a
socialist
vision
from
the
bench
that
could
never
pass
at
the
ballot
box.
"so,"
they
don't
want
to
show
the
judges
because
the
only
ones
that
he
can
put
in
are
far
left
radicals.
if
he
does
something
even
towards
left
of
"center,"
which
would
be
"acceptable,"
i
"guess,"
we
have
no
choice.
if
he
did
"that,"
he
would
lose
the
left.
"so,"
he's
going
to
have
to
put
in
radicals.
so
he
doesn't
want
to
show
who
his
judges
are.
i've
shown
a
"list,"
i
have
a
double
"list,"
about
45
from
which
i
will
only
"pick,"
but
he
doesn't
want
to
do
"that,"
because
if
you
found
out
who
he
was
going
to
"pick,"
he
would
be
unelectable.
"hopefully,"
he's
going
to
be
unelectable
anyway.
we're
going
to
find
out.
"so,"
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
survive
a
joe
biden.
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
survive.
we've
been
calling
it
socialism.
i
don't
think
it's
socialism.
i
think
it's
a
step
beyond
what
they're
talking
about.
you
look
at
"portland,"
you
look
at
"chicago,"
you
look
at
new
"york,"
you
look
at
baltimore
and
oakland.
these
are
democrat
run
cities
that
are
horrible
in
crime.
there's
no
law
and
"order,"
no
cash
"bail,"
no
anything.
you
know
what?
the
republican
cities
are
running
great.
they're
running
great.
"so,"
we're
going
to
get
it
all
changed
around.
we
went
into
"minneapolis,"
we
solved
the
problem
like
you
wouldn't
believe.
what
did
it
take?
you
saw
it.
what
did
that
take?
i
would
say
probably
30
minutes.
right?
they
should
have
called
us
in
about
seven
days
earlier.
how
about
the
reporter?
he
gets
up
"there,"
behind
him
is
a
burning
city.
i
never
saw
anything
like
it.
he's
"saying,"
"\"there"
are
really
no
protests
here.
this
is
very
"friendly.\""
we
call
this
a
friendly
protester
because
you're
not
supposed
to
have
political
rallies.
you're
not
supposed
to
have
anything.
the
only
thing
you
can
have
is
thousands
of
people
running
down
a
street
burning
"stores,"
"looting,"
doing
what
…
that's
"okay,"
because
that's
"protesting,"
but
we'll
call
this
a
friendly
"protest,"
but
your
children
will
be
robbed
of
their
future
and
the
damage
will
endure
for
generations
to
come-
…
future
the
damage
we'll
endure
for
generations
to
come.
we
have
to
win.
this
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country
in
my
opinion.
and
a
lot
of
that's
got
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we're
going
to
have
one
"extra,"
but
we
didn't
think
this
was
going
to
happen.
but
i
used
to
say
just
a
week
"ago,"
"\"we're"
going
to
have
"one,"
"two,"
"three,"
"four,"
and
maybe
even
"five,"
the
next
"president,"
and
the
supreme
court
is
going
to
be
a
tremendous
"factor.\""
a
lot
of
people
said
that's
the
reason
i
won
so
easily
in
the
electoral
college
last
time.
"306,"
306
to
223.
"\"he"
will
not
get
to
"270.\""
remember?
"\"he"
will
not
get
to
270.
this
will
be
a
short
evening
for
donald
trump.
"oh,"
good
riddance.
thank
god
we
got
rid
of
him.
"oh,"
this
is
going
to
be
"great.\""
and
then
that
problem
happened.
"\"ladies"
and
"gentlemen,"
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
"ohio.\""
remember
the
"one,"
she
was
crying?
she
was
crying.
"\"donald"
trump
has
won
"ohio.\""
but
it
wasn't
winning
"ohio,"
it
was
by
the
margin.
"\"where"
the
"hell?\""
he
"said,"
"\"where"
did
this
margin
come
"from?\""
they
opened
the
polls.
then
they
closed
the
polls.
normally
you
have
to
wait
"hours,"
unless
it's
a
total
runaway.
and
they
"said,"
"\"ah,"
the
polls
and
the
doors
are
closed
in
ohio.
donald
trump
has
"won.\""
and
they
"go,"
"\"oh"
my
god.
but
wait
a
minute.
he
won
by
nine
points.
what
the
hell's
going
on
over
"here?\""
then
they
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
has
won
the
state
of
florida.
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
georgia.
donald
trump
has
won
north
"carolina,"
south
"carolina.\""
remember
that?
was
that
the
most
exciting
"evening,"
really?
remember?
and
it's
not
donald
trump.
it's
you.
it's
all
of
us.
they
use
the
name
donald
trump.
it's
all
of
us
have
won.
and
this
one's
going
to
be
even
better
because
nobody
has
"done,"
and
then
don't
even
challenge
"it,"
the
fake
"news,"
nobody
has
done
in
three
and
a
half
years
what
we've
done.
we've
rebuilt
our
military.
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollars.
we've
taken
care
of
our
vets.
we
have
"choice,"
we
have
accountability.
we
can
fire
people
now
when
they're
not
treating
our
vets
right.
we
couldn't
do
that
before.
they
could
treat
our
vets
terribly.
we
have
accountability.
nobody
has
done
what
we've
done
for
our
vets.
91%
approval
rating
at
the
va.
"91%,"
the
highest
ever.
so
nobody's
done
"it,"
and
that's
why
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
important
of
all.
i
used
to
"say,"
"\"well,"
i
don't
know.
how
does
it
compare
to
"2016?\""
i
just
gave
that
up.
this
is
the
most
important
election.
you
know
why?
two
reasons.
number
"one,"
that's
over
"with,"
the
hell
with
it.
the
hell
with
it.
but
the
truth
is
it's
got
a
seat
"in,"
and
we
have
a
lot
of
new
things
including
"additional,"
"substantial,"
middle
income
tax
cuts
and
other
tax
"cuts,"
and
tremendous
regulation
cuts.
and
we're
finishing
up
with
our
military.
we're
building
space
force.
the
wall
is
going
incredibly.
you
remember
the
wall?
they
don't
talk
about
the
wall
"anymore,"
the
fake
news.
once
we
started
building
"it,"
if
you
think
that
was
easy
to
build
the
"wall,"
we
had
an
entire
party
that
would
die
for
the
"fact,"
and
i
made
a
terrible
mistake
in
the
"wall,"
instead
of
telling
"you,"
"\"we're"
going
to
build
a
"wall,"
we're
going
to
build
a
"wall,\""
the
democrats
"formed,"
it
was
very
"tough,"
but
i
got
it.
i'm
a
real
estate
developer.
you
can
always
get
money.
you
learn
we
have
a
lot
of
little
pockets.
we
had
a
lot
of
big
pockets.
but
the
military
was
great.
the
army
corps
of
engineers
were
great.
so
we're
up
to
330
miles
of
wall.
we're
doing
10
miles
a
"week,"
and
we're
going
to
be
finished
with
the
wall
very
soon.
and
it's
exactly
the
"wall,"
the
little
more
expensive
"wall,"
they
want
like
"nice,"
"expensive,"
but
exactly
what
border
patrol
wanted.
we're
building
them
the
exact
wall
that
they
want.
we
can't
give
them
any
excuses.
we
can't
give
them
any
excuses.
but
it's
"true,"
they
used
to
talk
about
the
wall
all
the
time
because
they
never
thought
i'd
be
able
to
get
a
bill.
once
i
got
it
"going,"
got
it
"built,"
i
got
the
"financing,"
we
won
a
lot
of
"lawsuits,"
by
the
"way,"
we
won
a
lot
of
lawsuits.
they
sued
us.
pelosi
was
suing
us.
congress
was
suing
us.
the
senate
was
suing
us.
we
won
a
lot
of
lawsuits.
once
it
was
obvious
that
we
won
and
we
started
"building,"
they
never
talk
about
the
wall
anymore.
and
i
made
a
"terrible,"
terrible
mistake
because
i
had
to
work
my
ass
off
to
get
that
thing
built.
you
have
no
idea.
you
have
no
idea.
you
have
no
idea.
but
i
should
have
"said,"
the
"mistake,"
i
should
have
said
when
i
talked
to
these
big
"crowds,"
and
the
crowds
are
getting
"bigger,"
there's
more
enthusiasm
now
than
we
ever
had
four
years
"ago,"
but
i
should
have
"said,"
instead
"of,"
"\"we"
will
build
a
"wall,\""
i
"kept,"
"\"we"
will
build
a
"wall,\""
place
would
go
"crazy,"
i
should
have
"said,"
"\"we"
will
not
build
the
wall.
under
no
"circumstances,"
will
we
build
a
"wall,\""
the
democrats
would
have
given
us
all
the
money
we
wanted.
it's
true.
it's
true.
and
then
they
would
have
"said,"
"\"see,"
he
didn't
keep
his
campaign
"promise.\""
these
people
are
sick.
the
biden
nominated
justices
will
shred
our
second
"amendment,"
eliminate
the
right
to
self
"defense,"
and
allow
the
government
to
confiscate
your
privately
owned
firearms.
you
know
that.
put
in
other
"language,"
they
will
end
your
second
amendment.
and
they
will
do
that.
by
the
"way,"
if
i
wasn't
"here,"
you
wouldn't
have
a
second
amendment
right
now.
that
would
be
gone.
i
hate
to
say
it.
i'm
the
only
thing
standing
between
you
and
"chaos,"
i'm
telling
you.
and
second
amendment
and
all
of
the
other
things.
biden's
justices
will
remove
the
words
"\"under"
"god\""
from
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
did
you
see
that?
did
you
see
it?
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
we'd
never
remove.
and
i
saw
"it,"
they're
doing
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
and
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
it
must
be
a
"typo.\""
they
left
the
words
"\"under"
"god\""
out
of
the
pledge
of
"allegiance,"
the
democrats.
and
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
there's
a
typo.
"typo,"
they
made
a
mistake.
what
a
stupid
mistake.
can
you
believe
it?
that
guy's
in
big
trouble.
what
a
stupid
"mistake.\""
and
then
i
heard
it
a
second
time.
they
did
the
same
mistake.
that's
what
they're
doing.
they're
going
to
take
god
out
of
everything
just
like
they
want
to
knock
down
the
statue
of
george
"washington,"
abraham
"lincoln,"
thomas
jefferson.
that's
never
happening.
it's
never
happening.
a
lot
of
these
democrats
"states,"
you
see
"it,"
the
churches
are
closed.
they
don't
want
our
churches
to
open.
you
can
have
a
riot
where
you
kill
people
in
the
streets.
"25,000"
people
don't
have
to
wear
a
"mask,"
nothing.
they
can
march
down
the
"streets,"
step
on
each
other's
"face,"
they
can
do
whatever
the
hell
they
"want,"
that's
okay.
but
you
can't
go
to
church.
they
have
"ideas,"
they
have
"plans,"
and
it's
never
happening
with
me
as
your
president.
that
i
can
tell
you.
and
you
see
"it,"
they
want
to
tear
down
crosses
from
public
spaces.
you
see
it.
since
i
signed
a
little
"law,"
they
were
ripping
down
a
lot
of
statues
about
four
months
"ago,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"do"
we
have
any
"laws,"
like
old
laws
when
they
was
"strong,"
when
we
were
"smart,"
when
we
were
"tough?\""
"\"sir,"
we
have
"one,"
"sir.\""
a
general
came
in.
"\"what's"
the
"law,"
"general?\""
"\"sir,"
there
was
a
law
from
quite
a
while
"ago,"
10
years
in
"prison.\""
they
didn't
use
the
word
"jail,"
prison.
prison's
a
tougher
word.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
"mean,"
10
"years?\""
"\"you"
get
10
years
in
prison
if
you
knock
down
a
statue
or
if
you
knock
down
a
"monument.\""
i
"said,"
"\"general,"
let
me
see
that
"sucker,"
please.
bring
that
to
my
"office.\""
and
we
revived
it
because
you
can't
get
that
approved
by
congress.
they
would
never.
today
in
"congress,"
you'd
do
"it,"
they'll
give
you
half
a
day
in
a
hotel
someplace.
so
10
years.
so
they
were
having
a
big
march
on
washington
in
two
days
and
i
signed
this
new
law.
we
updated
"it,"
and
it
was
10
years.
you
get
10
years
in
prison.
you
"touch,"
you
knock
down
a
monument.
and
there's
no
games.
this
is
the
old
days.
this
is
the
days
when
we
had
strong
"laws,"
when
we
had
real
"laws,"
when
we
had
real
politicians
that
knew
how
to
make
laws.
so
here's
the
thing.
so
they
weren't
going
to
come
"in,"
they
were
actually
looking
to
knock
down
the
statue
of
a
man
named
thomas
jefferson.
that's
not
too
good.
they
had
obliterated
a
lot
of
different
things.
and
so
i
had
a
news
conference.
i
announced
that
i'm
signing
a
law
that
anybody
that
knocks
down
a
monument
or
a
statue
gets
10
years
in
jail.
and
the
police
in
"washington,"
and
we
had
national
"guard,"
we
had
secret
service.
we
were
all
ready
for
them.
we
were
ready
for
them.
and
the
time
"came,"
there's
was
only
a
"problem,"
nobody
showed
up.
you
know
why?
10
years
was
too
much.
10
years
was
too
much.
it's
amazing
the
way.
isn't
it
amazing
the
way
it
all
works?
so
instead
they
burned
down
portland.
i
speak
to
the
governor.
the
mayor
is
hopeless.
he's
a
"hopeless,"
poor
guy.
they
chased
him
out
of
his
"apartment,"
and
he
still
thinks
they're
wonderful
people.
they're
burning
down
his
city.
but
i
want
to
go
in
there
with
the
national
guard
so
bad.
it
would
take
us
15
minutes
to
solve
the
problem.
when
they
heard
in
seattle
that
we
were
going
"in,"
we
were
going
in
the
next
"day,"
the
guys
just
walked
away.
they
left.
that
was
the
end
of
it.
we
had
nothing
to
do.
but
they
want
to
ban
all
prayer
in
public
schools
and
require
taxpayers
to
fund
extreme
late
term
abortion.
biden's
justices
will
erase
national
"borders,"
they
don't
want
"borders,"
protect
sanctuary
"cities,"
and
compel
the
unlimited
entry
of
foreign
nationals.
and
if
you
look
at
some
of
these
jihadist
"nations,"
no
thank
you.
somebody
"said,"
"\"that's"
not
nice.
that's
not
politically
"correct.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"okay.\""
they'll
clip
all
the
police
"departments,"
free
violent
"criminals,"
shield
foreign
"terrorists,"
and
declare
the
death
penalty
"unconstitutional,"
even
for
the
most
depraved
mass
murderers
who
kill
women
and
children.
that's
what
they
want.
they
don't
want
any
death
penalty.
not
for
the
boston
"bomber,"
not
for
anybody.
you
see
the
boston
"bomber,"
they're
still
trying
this
"guy,"
what
he
did
to
so
many
lives.
he
killed
"people,"
ruined
so
many
"families,"
ruined
so
many
lives.
and
by
the
"way,"
they
want
the
boston
bomber
to
be
able
to
vote.
you
know
that.
in
three
and
a
half
years
under
my
"administration,"
we've
secured
america's
"borders,"
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
united
states
"military,"
obliterated
the
isis
caliphate
"100%,"
fixed
our
disastrous
trade
"deals,"
and
brought
jobs
and
factories
back
to
the
great
state
of
ohio.
i
love
ohio.
i
love
ohio.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
i
was
told
by
bob
and
some
of
the
congressmen
that
are
"here,"
we
have
some
great
"ones,"
i'm
going
to
introduce
them
in
a
"second,"
but
i
was
told
that
they're
not
even
trying
for
ohio.
you
know
why?
because
i
love
you
and
you
love
"me,"
and
that's
the
way
it
is.
that's
the
way
it
is.
thank
you.
i
love
you
too.
it's
very
interesting.
so
somebody
in
the
fake
news
media
did
a
story
yesterday
because
there's
crazy
chances
going
on.
they
have
too
about
the
seat
and
all
that.
but
there
was
another
chant
that's
happening
at
all
these
rallies.
we're
having
massive
rallies.
we're
in
minnesota.
we
had
a
tremendous
crowd.
"wisconsin,"
tremendous.
"pennsylvania,"
every
one
of
them.
i
"mean,"
in
all
"fairness,"
it's
like
"this,"
everyone.
but
this
rant
is
going
on
like
it's
crazy.
and
"it's,"
"\"we"
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
"you,\""
and
you
know
what?
i
don't
want
to
say
it.
i'm
just
"saying,"
they
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
the
history
of
politics
in
this
"nation,"
even
we
loved
ronald
"reagan,"
but
they
have
not
been
able
to
find
where
people
broke
out
and
"said,"
"\"we"
love
"you,\""
"about,"
i
guess
i
have
to
call
myself
a
politician.
i
don't
feel
like
a
politician.
how
nice
is
that?
i
never
heard
it.
i've
been
to
a
lot
of
different
speeches
and
rallies.
i've
never
heard
crowds
"go,"
"\"we"
love
"you.\""
but
you
know
why?
we
love
you.
i
love
you.
but
you
know
why?
"because,"
"again,"
nobody
has
done
what
we've
done.
ohio
had
the
best
year
in
its
history
last
year.
we
had
a
great
year.
and
next
"year,"
assuming
we
"win,"
which
i
hope
we're
going
to
"win,"
but
if
we
"win,"
you're
going
to
have
a
year
next
year.
first
of
"all,"
take
a
look
at
the
third
quarter.
it's
going
to
be
announced
the
numbers
just
before
the
election.
they'll
come
out
three
days
before
the
election.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
i'll
bet
on
the
"numbers,"
even
though
crazy
nancy
and
these
people
don't
want
to
give
any
"stimulus,"
they
don't
want
to
give
anything.
they
want
to
keep
a
lot
of
states
closed
wherever
they
can.
you
know
what
they're
going
to
do?
they're
going
to
announce
they're
going
to
be
opening
on
november
4th.
there'll
be
open.
all
these
closed
"states,"
they're
going
to
be
open
on
november
4th.
one
of
them
blue
and
a
teacher's
union.
did
you
see
it?
"\"no,"
we
don't
want
to
open
now.
we
don't
want
to
open.
the
pandemic.
we
don't
want
"to.\""
we're
rounding
the
turn
on
the
pandemic.
vaccines
are
coming
soon.
"\"but"
we
don't
want
to
open.
around
november
4th
we're
going
to
"open.\""
this
person
that's
a
judge
of
a
union
said
that.
that
was
not
good.
i
think
they'll
get
rid
of
her
quickly.
i'm
also
proud
that
we
have
successfully
brought
back
the
big
10
and
the
ohio
state
buckeyes.
you
better
have
a
good
year
after
all
of
that.
you
have
a
good
"team,"
right?
good
coach.
good
team.
good
everything.
you
have
a
good
team.
you
always
have
a
good
team.
but
there
was
a
"case,"
what
do
i
know?
i
"said,"
"\"how's"
it
going?
everything
good?
are
you
"struggling?\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
sleepy
joe
biden
did
an
ad
that
"you,\""
"me,"
"\"that"
you
closed
"football.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
mean
i
closed?
i
didn't
"close.\""
the
guy
did
an
ad.
it's
called
disinformation.
it's
called
the
opposite
of
what
the
fact
is.
not
only
didn't
i
close
"it,"
i
didn't
think
about
it
too
"much,"
okay?
the
states
should
all
be
open.
but
i
heard
about
big
10
"football,"
and
because
of
this
"ad,"
i
"said,"
"\"hey,"
wait
a
minute.
i
have
an
"idea.\""
it
was
a
fake
"ad,"
just
like
the
ad
on
the
grave
"sites,"
and
that
allows
me
to
say
that
this
man
is
a
gross
incompetent.
he
has
no
idea.
because
"now,"
"see,"
i
would
never
talk
like
"that,"
but
when
i
saw
that
horrible
"thing,"
and
nobody's
done
more
for
the
military
than
i
"have,"
when
i
saw
that
horrible
"ad,"
"\"an"
anonymous
source
has
said
that
donald
trump
said
"this,\""
i
have
28
people
now
that
have
come
forward
saying
it's
a
total
"lie,"
they
don't
"care,"
so
they
did
an
"ad,"
once
they
did
"that,"
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
now
the
gloves
are
"off.\""
let's
face
"it,"
joe
biden
is
incompetent.
he
always
was
even
in
prime
time.
he
was
incompetent
in
prime
time.
and
now
he's
really
incompetent.
but
because
of
the
"ad,"
i
"said,"
"\"it's"
very
"interesting,"
that
"ad,"
it's
very
interesting.
let
me
call
up
the
"commissioner.\""
i
had
called
up
the
"commissioner,"
very
good
"guy,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"commissioner,"
what
can
we
do
to
get
big
10
football
"back?\""
"\"well,"
i
don't
"know.\""
and
we
started
a
little
"thing,"
the
commissioner
and
"myself,"
one
of
my
"guys,"
he's
"fantastic,"
and
within
a
few
"days,"
it
started
getting
talked
"about,"
and
then
we
kept
it
going
and
we
helped
him
with
some
testing
because
we
have
the
greatest
testing
in
the
world.
we
get
no
credit
for
it.
we've
tested
almost
100
million
people.
india
is
second
with
38th
and
they
have
1.5
billion
"people,"
slightly
more
than
you.
but
i
will
tell
"you,"
so
all
of
a
sudden
they
have
schools.
then
looked
like
it
was
going
to
open
without
michigan
and
without
a
couple
of
states.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
pressure
became
so
"great,"
and
the
full
league
is
opening
now
and
it's
going
to
be
very
exciting.
and
i
will
tell
"you,"
it's
not
a
question
of
taking
"credit,"
but
truly
we
were
the
ones
that
did
that.
i
"mean,"
it
was.
i'll
tell
you
when
i
do
it
and
when
i
don't.
but
it
was
"closed,"
it
was
"gone,"
it
was
announced
that
it
was
closed.
and
what
really
spurred
me
on
was
when
sleepy
joe
announced
that
i
was
the
one
that
did
it.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
didn't
even
know
it
was
"closed.\""
but
once
i
found
out
it
"was,"
i
called
the
commissioner.
he
was
really
"good,"
i
tell
you.
and
we
called
a
couple
of
the
top
people
at
the
universities
and
they
got
it
going.
it
looked
like
we
had
seven
"schools,"
eight
schools.
all
of
a
"sudden,"
everybody
fell
into
line.
i
think
they're
all
open
now.
every
one
of
them
is
participating.
so
i
want
to
thank
the
commissioner.
i
want
to
thank
all
of
those
schools.
may
the
best
team
win.
in
other
"words,"
ohio
state.
that's
a
good
team.
you
know
who
the
best
proponents
were?
the
players
and
especially
the
parents
of
the
players.
these
kids
have
a
short
window
to
get
into
the
nfl
to
create
some
excitement
and
how
good
they
are.
and
you
have
a
lot
of
potential
"players,"
but
they
couldn't
play
football.
and
they
"said,"
"\"we're"
safer
on
the
field
than
we
are
staying
at
"home,\""
and
they
meant
it.
and
we
did
something
and
i'm
happy
about
it.
so
enjoy
the
"football,"
enjoy
it.
under
16
years
of
presidents
obama
and
"bush,"
median
household
income
rose
only
"$2,945."
so
remember
that.
that's
16
"years,"
"2009,"
so
let's
say
3000.
under
three
years
of
president
"trump,"
it
rose
almost
"$7,000."
so
think
of
"that,"
16
years.
three
"years,"
achieving
the
highest
median
income
in
the
history
of
our
country.
in
my
first
three
"years,"
we
lifted
6.6
million
people
out
of
"poverty,"
the
largest
poverty
reduction
of
any
president
in
the
history
of
our
country.
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
we
are
doing
it
again.
we're
building
it
again.
i
see
the
signs
"\"make"
america
great
"again,\""
so
i
say
"this,"
it's
called
now
"\"make"
america
great
again.
"again\"."
because
we
did
it
and
then
we
had
to
close
it
up.
we
saved
millions
of
lives.
if
we
didn't
do
"that,"
you
would
have
had
three
million
people.
it
would
have
been
terrible.
it's
terrible
anyway.
they
shouldn't
have
allowed
it
to
"happen,"
china.
to
defeat
the
china
"virus,"
we
launched
the
largest
mobilization
since
world
war
two.
through
pioneering
"therapies,"
we
reduced
the
fatality
rate-
through
pioneering
"therapies,"
we
reduced
the
fatality
rate
85%
since
april.
think
of
that.
that's
remdesivir
and
all
of
the
"things,"
the
"plasma,"
all
different
things.
where
do
you
see
what's
coming
out?
europe
is
almost
30%
greater
excess
mortality
rate
than
the
united
states.
that's
before
today's
big
breakout.
you
know
they
had
a
big
breakout
in
europe
and
they
keep
saying
in
the
fake
"news,"
they
keep
saying
"about,"
"\"oh,"
"europe,"
"europe,"
"europe.\""
"well,"
we're
doing
better
than
europe.
i
hate
to
see
what
"happened,"
and
it
had
a
big
impact
on
the
market
today
because
it
was
a
bad
thing.
but
they
had
a
big
hit
and
they'll
take
care
of
it.
they
know
how
to
do
it.
they'll
take
care
of
it.
we're
working
very
closely
with
europe
and
other
"countries,"
including
on
the
vaccine.
we
have
three
vaccines
right
now
that
are
right
there.
they're
right
at
the
starting
gate
and
they're
going
to
be
fantastic.
so
it's
good.
with
"biden,"
if
you
had
that
"regime,"
you'd
be
three
years
away
because
it
would
have
never
gotten
out
of
the
fda.
what
we've
done
in
a
very
safe
manner
is
amazing.
now
remember
"this,"
biden
was
in
charge
of
the
swine
"flu,"
right?
it's
called
the
h1n1.
remember
he
calls
it
the
n1h1.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
"no.\""
h
comes
before
the
n.
it's
so
easy.
but
he
"goes,"
"\"the"
"n1h1.\""
we
"say,"
"\"no.\""
but
it's
the
swine
flu.
maybe
we
just
call
it
the
swine
flu.
he
did
such
a
"gross,"
horrible
job
on
that.
his
own
man
who
was
in
charge
of
it
said
they
didn't
have
a
clue.
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
doing.
it
was
a
much
less
lethal
disease
and
they
lost
"many,"
many
people.
"many,"
many
people.
it
was
totally
incompetently.
and
now
i
got
this
guy
standing
up.
"well,"
we're
giving
him
advice.
his
own
guy
that
ran
it.
did
everybody
see
this?
they're
saying
they
didn't
have
a
clue
what
they
were
doing.
it
was
so
bad.
i
don't
know
why
the
hell
he
said
"it,"
to
be
honest
with
you.
who
would
say
that?
maybe
because
he
was
honest.
does
that
make
sense?
now
biden
gets
up
and
he's
saying
to
do
the
same
things
as
we've
already
done.
he
basically
took
our
plan
and
he
"said,"
"\"this"
is
what
you
should
"do.\""
but
we
have
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
of
any
major
country
in
the
world
and
the
fastest
economic
recovery
by
far
of
any
western
nation
by
far.
our
bold
and
early
action
saved
millions
of
lives
and
our
decisive
economic
response
saved
tens
of
millions
of
"jobs,"
including
1.9
million
jobs
in
the
state
of
ohio.
you
know
that?
he
knows
it.
he's
got
one
of
them.
he's
got
one
of
them.
through
operation
warp
"speed,"
we're
developing
these
great
vaccines.
and
that's
going
to
be…
"literally,"
these
will
be
done
in
record
time.
like
nobody's
ever
done
it
before.
on
november
"3rd,"
ohio
will
decide
whether
we
end
the

and
return
to

or
whether
we
allow
sleepy
joe
biden
and
his
group
of
incompetence
to
delay
the
"vaccine,"
shut
down
the

he
actually
suggested
that
he
would
shut
down
the
country.
we
now
know
the
disease.
we
didn't
know
it.
now
we
know
it
affects
elderly
people
with
heart
problems
and
other
problems.
if
they
have
other
"problems,"
that's
what
it
really
affects.
that's
it.
you
"know,"
in
some
"states,"
thousands
of
"people,"
nobody
young
below
the
age
of
"18,"
like
nobody.
they
have
a
strong
immune
system.
who
knows?
take
your
hat
off
to
the
young
because
they
have
a
hell
of
an
immune
"system,"
but
it
affects
virtually
nobody.
it's
an
amazing
thing.
by
the
"way,"
open
your
schools.
everybody
open
your

sleepy
joe
biden
wants
to
impose
a
$4
trillion

ban

"energy,"
destroy
the
"suburbs,"
give

to

how
about
that
one?
you
know
the
bad
part
about
that?
we
all
have
heart.
we
want
to
take
care
of

probably
that
is
everybody's
going
to
come
to

that
weren't

thinking
about

going

"say,"
"\"oh"

are
giving

giving

remember
i
said
that
jokingly
and
cnn
"said,"
"\"he"
misrepresented.
they
are
not
getting
a
rolls

i
agree.
now
they're
sick.
they
are
sick.
and
indoctrinate
your
children
with
poisonous
anti-american
lies.
they're
doing
that.
we're
stopping
it.
to
combat
the
toxic
left-wing
propaganda
in
our
"schools,"
i
announced
last
week
that
we're
launching
a
pro-american
lesson
plan
for
students
called
1776
commission.
we
will
teach
our

the
truth
about
"america,"
that
we
are
the
most
exceptional

on
the
face
of
the

and
we
are
getting
better
and
better
all

not

running

who
likes
kamilla?
does
anybody
like
her?
she
was
the
most
failed
candidate.
i
"mean,"
she
started
off
good.
and
every
week
she
went
"down,"
down
15
"points,"
12
"points,"
11
"points,"
9
"points,"
six

didn't
she
leave
at
about
two
or
one?
she
was
heading
down
to
the
basement.
she
was
so
mean
to
him.
i
felt
sorry
for
him.
"no,"
i
did.
i
felt
sorry.
so
she
called
them
everything
from
a
racist
to
a
metooer.
he
was
metoo.
he
was
a
part
of
the
metoo
generation.
what
she
called
"him,"
what
she
said.
so
i
brilliantly
"said,"
"\"well,"
he
can't
pick
pocahontas
because
she
was
too
nasty.
how
nasty
was
she
to
bloomberg?
was
she
unbelievable?
"boy,"
he

standing
there.
what

"no,"

he's
another

he's
a
real

mini
"mike,"
what
happened?
what
the
hell
happened?
he
hit
her
so
hard.
remember?
she
hits
him
with
about
30
different
"things,"
and
i'm
not
talking
about
our
president.
he
thought
she
was
talking
about
me.
can
you
believe
it?
and
i'm
not
talking.
i'm
talking
about
you.
he
"said,"
"\"get"
me
out
of

get
me
out

and
now
he
wants
to
buy
his

back
into

buy

he
hasn't
taken

if
i

sort

ride

out

stay
with

you
saw
that?
including

who
attempted
to
murder
a
police
officer
and
a
man
accused
of
sexually
assaulting
an
eight
year
old

now
they're
trying
to
free

on
bail.
they're
putting
up
the
money
to
get
them
out
by
this
plan
to
appease
the
domestic
terrorist.
and
that's
what
it
is.
my
plan
is
to
arrest
the
domestic
"terrorist,"
and
that's
what
we're
doing
for

about

this
is

but
they
started
hitting

then
they
hit

now
gandhi
was
about

just
wanted

rip

if

i'll
tell
"you,"

that's
most
"hurt,"
most
hurt
by
what
they're
doing

there
is

called

ran

spent
the
last
four

reversing
the
damage
done
by

of

always
talking
"about,"

about

tell

that
was
designed
to
hurt
our
country.

would
have
lost
trillions
of
"dollars,"
closed
your
factories
all
over
the

in
the
"meantime,"
china
didn't
kick
in
for
another
10
years.
the
whole
thing
was
a
rigged
deal.
i
tell
"you,"
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going

get
killed

right
away.

around

are

going

they
tell
him
to

about

we
achieved
american
energy.
we
passed
record
tax
cuts
and
regulations.
our
energy
independence
is
incredible.
we
have
now
energy
independence.
we
don't
have
to
be
in
these
far
away
lands
anymore.
now
we'll
be
there
to
help
certain
allies
that
have
been
"great,"
but
we
don't
have
to
be.
since
my
"election,"
natural
gas
production
in
ohio
has
surged
63%.
they
want
to
close
it
up.
by
the
"way,"
you
do
know
they
want
to
close
it
up.
they
want
to
close
up
all
fracking
natural
gas
ever.
they
want
to
close
it
up.
this
would
kill
at
least
"700,000"
ohio
jobs.
probably
more
than
a
million.
while
i'm
"president,"
america
will
remain
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
and
ohio
workers
will
continue
leading
the
way.
i
just
left
the
great
state
of
"texas,"
and
i
talked
to
a
lot
of
people
like
"this,"
a
great
crowd
of
people.
we
have
tremendous
support
all
over
the
country.
i'll
tell
you
what.
these
people
are
great.
and
here's
the
platform
that
they
have.
sleepy
joe
biden.
no
"oil,"
no
"religion,"
no
"god,"
and
no
guns.
now
i'm
in
texas.
it's
a
really
rough
thing
in
"ohio,"
but
now
we're
talking
texas.
no
"oil,"
that
doesn't
work
well
in
"texas,"
right?
no
guns.
that
doesn't
work
well
in
texas.
no
god.
look
what
they're
doing
to
the
churches
and
everything.
that
doesn't
work.
no
god.
no
religion.
that
doesn't
work
well.
you
would
have
to
be
george
washington
with
your
running
mate
would
be
abraham
lincoln.
okay.
your
vp
candidate.
and
you'd
still
lose
very
big.
and
then
they
say-
…
and
you'd
still
lose
very
big.
and
then
they
"say,"
"\"yeah,"
he's
doing
okay.
he's
two
up
in
"texas.\""
they
said
it
last
time
"too,"
that
texas
is
"even,"
four
years
ago.
and
everybody
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
think
trump
is
killing
"it.\""
we'd
have
stadiums
with
"25,000,"
"30,000"
"people,"
much
more
that
couldn't
get
in.
we'd
have
"40,000,"
"50,000"
people
outside
and
they'd
say
i
was
even.
we
won
in
a
"landslide,"
just
like
we
won
this
"state,"
in
a
landslide.
you
know
the
expression
they
"use,"
"\"texas"
is
in
"play.\""
you
know
what
"\"in"
"play\""
means?
it
could
go
either
way.
and
guys
would
get
on
there
and
"say,"
"\"i"
don't
think
"so.\""
and
then
that
night
"again,"
"\"the"
polls
in
texas
have
closed.
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
"texas.\""
i
"mean,"
the
whole
thing
is
crazy.
it's
"crazy,"
it's
crazy.
you
know
what
they
do?
it's
suppression
polls.
they
try
and
depress
you.
they
try
and
make
you
unhappy
so
you
go
out
to
dinner
with
your
"wife,"
your
"husband,"
you
go
out
to
"dinner,"
"\"darling,"
let's
have
dinner.
it's
so
sad.
we
love
"donald,"
but
he
just
can't
make
it.
he
can't
make
it.
let's
go
"out,"
have
dinner.
we'll
come
home
and
watch
the
"results.\""
except
2016
came
and
nobody
did
"that,"
they
all
went
out
and
voted
and
we
kicked
ass.
tell
"me,"
was
that
the
most
exciting
evening
in
the
history
of
television?
did
you
ever
see
the
"ratings,"
the
combined
ratings?
i
think
the
biggest
ever.
but
was
that
the
most
exciting?
"2016,"
was
that
the
most
exciting
evening
in
the
history
of
television?
we
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
u.s.
"military,"
including
more
than
$6
billion
in
contracts.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
you
like
the
word
pronounced
lima
or
"lima,"
because
i
saved
lima.
and
i
tell
you
"what,"
i
saved
lima.
i
came
here
and
they
were
going
to
close
that
plant
in
lima.
they
were
going
to
close
the
tank
plant.
it
was
done.
and
i
"said,"
"\"why"
are
we
closing
a
tank
"plant?\""
and
i
got
a
couple
of
calls
from
my
"friends,"
the
congressman
right
here.
and
i
got
calls.
and
jim
jordan
called
me.
do
you
like
jim
jordan?
he's
great.
and
i
looked
at
this
army
tank
plant
in
lima.
i
"said,"
"\"why"
are
we
closing
"it?\""
and
i
saw
the
people
building
the
tanks
and
the
technology's
incredible.
and
if
you
ever
closed
"it,"
you'd
never
be
able
to
open
a
thing
like
that
again.
so
i
overrode
the
"generals,"
i
overrode
"everybody,"
and
now
we're
making
a
record
number
of
tanks
in
that
plant
and
it's
absolutely
thriving.
but
we
had
tremendous
success.
we
took
100%
of
the
isis
caliphate
and
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi.
we
took
out
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murder
of
american
troops
and
many
other
people.
qasem
soleimani
is
dead.
he's
dead.
i
withdrew
from
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
they
paid
$150
"billion,"
plus
$1.8
billion
in
cash.
you
know
they
got?
nothing.
they
got
nothing.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
every
president
for
"many,"
many
decades
said
they
were
going
to
do
it.
they
never
did
it.
they
never
did
it.
they
didn't
have
the
guts
to
do
it.
they
campaigned
on
"it,"
they
were
all
going
to
do
it.
then
they
got
"there,"
there
was
a
lot
of
pressure
put
on
them.
a
lot
of
pressure
put
on
me.
every
leader
was
calling
all
over.
"\"please"
don't
do
it.
please
don't
do
it.
mr.
"president,"
please
don't
do
it.
don't
do
it.
don't
move
it.
just
leave
it
the
way
it
is.
it's
"okay.\""
but
i
promised
and
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
do
"it.\""
and
then
i
got
calls
from
the
biggest
people
in
the
world.
"kings,"
i
got
calls
from
"presidents,"
from
prime
"ministers,"
"\"please,"
please
don't
tell
"it.\""
then
i
got
"calls,"
"\"please"
have
him
call
me
back
"me,\""
me.
i
"said,"
"\"look,"
tell
everybody
i'm
out
for
three
days.
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
call
them
"back.\""
i
had
a
news
"conference,"
we
announced
it.
then
i
called
everybody
back.
"\"hey,"
how
you
doing?
how's
everything
going?
everything
going
"good?\""
"\"yeah,"
"well,"
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
"israel,"
but
it's
too
late.
you
already
did
"it.\""
and
we
did
it
and
we
got
it
done
and
nobody
else
got
it
done.
and
it's
something
we
had
to
do.
i
also
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
and
instead
of
endless
"wars,"
we
are
forging
peace
all
over
the
middle
east.
and
you
saw
that.
and
i'm
the
only
man
that
got
nominated
for
a
nobel
peace
prize
and
i
didn't
get
any
press.
they
wouldn't.
for
two
of
them.
last
"week,"
i'm
not
bragging
about
"it,"
i'm
just
"saying,"
i'm
the
president
of
the
united
states
because
of
"kosovo-serbia,"
they've
been
killing
each
other
for
"years,"
i
worked
out
a
deal
for
them.
i
got
nominated.
and
then
israel
with
bahrain
and
"uae,"
and
many
more
to
come.
i
"mean,"
they
all
want
to
do
it.
we'll
have
peace
in
the
middle
east
without
blood
all
over
the
sand.
no
blood.
we're
going
to
have
peace
in
the
middle
east.
so
i
was
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
prize.
and
i
told
this
story
last
night.
should
i
tell
it
or
not?
should
i?
yes.
she
wants
me
to
do
it.
so
i
go
home
to
our
great
first
lady.
i
"said,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
you're
going
to
be
so
proud
of
me
tonight.
i
was
nominated
not
once
but
twice
for
totally
separate
events
by
different
"people.\""
great
people.
"\"first"
"lady,"
i
was
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
"prize.\""
i
was
like
this.
"\"i"
was
"nominated.\""
it's
a
big
deal
for
our
"country,"
right?
and
she
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
"good.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
turn
on
the
evening
news.
let's
watch
it.
this
is
going
to
be
a
big
show
tonight.
get
"ready.\""
and
"nbc,"
which
is
one
of
the
most
"crooked,"
one
of
the
worst
"newscasts,"
and
i'm
talking
about
normal
"nbc,"
not
msdnc.
msdnc
is
the
worst.
so
i
turned
on
nbc
with
lester
"holt,"
another
beauty.
and
they
start
with
a
hurricane
and
then
they
went
to
"something,"
and
something
else.
and
i'm
"saying,"
"\"first"
"lady,"
this
is
getting
a
little
embarrassing.
we're
20
minutes
into
a
half
hour
show.
they
haven't
mentioned
the
nobel
peace
"prize.\""
and
then
it
went
through
the
whole
show
and
they
never
mentioned.
then
i
got
nominated
for
a
second
one.
they
never
mentioned.
and
when
barack
"obama,"
barack
hussein
obama
got
"nominated,"
now
when
barack
hussein
obama
got
"nominated,"
he
didn't
know
why
he
was
nominated.
it
was
like
right
at
the
very
beginning.
he
didn't
do
anything.
he
did
nothing
and
he
got
nominated.
it
was
the
biggest
story
i've
ever
seen.
but
that's
okay.
in
the
"meantime,"
we're
president
and
they're
not.
"no,"
that's
right.
you
would
think
if
you
nominated
for
the
nobel
"prize,"
you'd
get
maybe
half
a
second.
the
first
"lady,"
she
"said,"
"\"sorry,"
darling.
that's
the
way
it
"goes,"
isn't
"it?\""
joe
biden
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
killing
soleimani.
he
voted
for
the
iraq
war
disaster.
he
backed
the
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
and
he
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
very
positive
development
for
our
country.
"\"oh,"
it's
really
"great.\""
if
it
were
up
to
sleepy
"joe,"
bin
laden
and
soleimani
would
be
alive
"today,"
isis
would
be
on
a
"rampage,"
iran
would
control
the
middle
"east,"
and
china
would
be
the
dominant
power
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
i
want
to
tell
"you,"
if
you
go
back
a
few
months
before
this
"pandemic,"
we
were
"gaining,"
"gaining,"
gaining.
we
had
an
insurmountable
lead
on
china.
i
always
heard
they
were
going
to
catch
us
by
2019
for
10
years.
we
were
so
far
"beyond,"
we
were
doing
much
better
than
they
were.
the
biden
agenda
would
obliterate
our
economy.
he
destroyed
social
"security,"
destroyed
protections
for
pre-existing
conditions.
that's
what
he's
going
to
"do,"
drain
your
medicare
by
giving
away
your
healthcare
to
illegal
immigrants.
he
would
end
our
travel
ban
to
jihadist
regions
and
increase
refugee
admissions
"by,"
listen
to
"this,"
over
700%.
and
this
is
the
manifesto
with
bernie
"sanders,"
with
crazy
bernie.
he
made
this
deal
with
crazy
bernie.
and
by
the
"way,"
a
lot
of
the
crazy
bernie
voters
last
"time,"
four
years
"ago,"
voted
for
trump
because
of
"trade,"
because
the
one
thing
they
do
"understand,"
that
our
country
has
been
off
for
years.
biden
opposes
school
choice
and
vowed
to
ban
charter
schools.
very
important
to
have
them.
in
a
second
"term,"
i
will
provide
school
choice
to
every
parent
in
america.
they're
totally
against
it.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
"jobs,"
and
a
limitless
future
for
all
americans.
and
"just,"
in
"conclusion,"
first
of
"all,"
it's
been
a
great
honor
to
be
with
you.
this
"is,"
"really,"
it's
a
great
state.
they're
great
people.
i
really
mean
it.
"no,"
i
really
mean
it.
get
out
there
on
november
3rd.
we've
got
to
win
this
one
big.
this
is
a
"bad,"
bad
ideology.
this
is
probably
a
step
beyond
socialism.
i
really
think
in
many
"ways,"
it's
communism
we're
talking
about.
this
is
a
step
beyond.
socialism's
no
good.
communism's
really
bad.
but
get
out
there
on
november
3rd
and
let's
show
him
your
stuff
and
show
them
the
stuff
of
all
of
us.
"so,"
in
"concluding,"
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world
and
we
will
end
the
"reliance,"
this
"ridiculous,"
crazy
reliance
on
"china,"
and
all
of
these
far
away
lands
once
and
for
all.
we
will
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
states.
we
will
hire
more
police.
and
by
the
"way,"
thank
"you,"
police.
thank
"you,"
law
enforcement.
increased
penalties
for
assaults
on
law
enforcement
and
we
will
ban
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
"speech,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
citizens
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
these
"ridiculous,"
"stupid,"
"endless,"
foreign
wars.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military.
our
military
might
has
never
been
like
it
is
right
now
because
of
what
we've
done.
and
we
had
no
"choice,"
and
hope
to
god
we
never
have
to
use
"it,"
because
if
you
would
ever
see
the
power
of
what
we've
done
over
the
last
three
"years,"
it's
almost
better
for
you
not
to
see
it.
we
are
the
envy
of
every
"power,"
every
country
in
the
world.
we
have
weapons
that
nobody
ever
even
thought
possible.
and
just
as
i
"said,"
hope
to
god
we
never
have
to
use
them.
and
the
way
we
don't
have
to
use
them
is
to
keep
that
kind
of
strength.
nobody's
going
to
be
talking
to
us.
we're
going
to
have
peace
through
"strength,"
and
it's
all
made
in
the
u.s.a.
made
in
the
u.s.a.
we'll
end
surprise
medical
"billing,"
require
price
transparency.
i've
already
signed
it
into
law.
kicks
in
on
january
1st.
it's
going
to
cut
your
bills
down
to
a
level
that
you
wouldn't
believe.
that
doesn't
mean
the
drug
companies
and
the
hospital
and
corporations
are
happy
with
me.
but
that's
okay.
and
further
reduce
health
insurance
premiums
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
by
"50%,"
60%
and
70%.
big
pharma
does
not
like
me
too
much.
they're
taking
ads
about
me
that
are
so
"bad,"
but
you
get
"it,"
you
understand
it.
they're
not
too
thrilled
with
"me,"
including
the
rebates.
the
rebates
go
back
to
you.
the
rebates
before
went
back
to
very
rich
people.
we
will
strongly
protect
medicare
and
social
"security,"
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions.
and
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on
mars.
that's
what's
happening.
nasa
is
again
the
leading
space
station
anywhere
in
the
world.
there's
nothing
like
a
space
"center,"
what
we've
done.
and
there
was
grass
growing
in
the
runways
when
i
took
over
three
and
a
half
years
ago.
we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students

for
that
very
big
victory
we
had
three
years
ago.
time
is
flying.
you
getting
ready?
let's
do
it
again.
right?
let's
do
it
again.
i
just
heard
that
the
united
states
house
of
"representative,"
has
overwhelmingly
voted
to
kill
the
most
ridiculous
project
i've
ever
been
involved
"in,"
the
resolution.
how
stupid
is
that?
own
impeachment.
i
want
to
thank
those
democrats
because
many
of
them
voted
for
us.
the
vote
was
a
totally
lopsided
332
to
95
to
1.
332
to
"95,"
think
of
"it,"
we
have
the
strongest
economy
in
"history,"
the
lowest
unemployment
numbers
"ever,"
we've
rebuilt
the
most
powerful
"military,"
it
was
totally
depleted
when
i
took
"office,"
and
now
it's
rebuilt.
we
passed
the
largest
tax
cuts
and
regulation
cuts
of
any
president
or
any
administration
in
history.
we
took
care
of
our
great
"vets,"
including
veterans
"choice,"
and
veterans
accountability.
and
they
want
to
try
and
"impeach,"
it's
a
disgrace.
it's
a
disgrace.
so
now
we
have
that
behind
"us,"
and
i
have
to
say
"this,"
and
i'll
say
it
just
"once,"
what
happened
to
me
with
this
witch
hunt
should
never
be
allowed
to
happen
to
another
president
of
the
united
states.
"never,"
ever
again.
i
want
to
thank
republican
leadership
for
what
they've
done
for
all
of
"us,"
by
stopping
that
"hoax,"
the
russian
hoax
i
call
"it,"
because
america
is
winning
again.
america's
respected
"again,"
"and,"
because
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
our
economic
policy
can
be
summed
up
in
three
very
beautiful
and
simple
"words,"
"jobs,"
"jobs,"
jobs.
we've
created
6
million
new
jobs
since
election
day.
if
i
would
have
said
"that,"
nobody
would
have
believed
it.
if
i
would've
said
"that,"
the
fake
news
would
have
said
he's
exaggerating.
and
i
wouldn't
have
said
it
because
i
wasn't
even
sure
we
could
do
it.
think
of
"it,"
6
million
jobs
since
election
"day,"
think
of
it.
and
by
the
"way,"
north
carolina
has
had
its
best
economic
year
in
the
history
of
your
state.
our
country
has
added
more
than
"180,000"
people
to
the
"workforce,"
and
think
of
that
through
what
we've
done
on
a
federal
basis.
you
picked
up
over
"180,000"
"jobs,"
north
carolina.
think
of
"that,"
and
you
have
your
lowest
unemployment
rate.
you
have
a
lot
of
good
"things,"
but
let's
not
talk
too
much
about
north
carolina.
let's
win
this
election
nationwide.
you
remember
north
"carolina,"
that
was
going
to
be
the
clinton
firewall.
she
spent
a
fortune
"here,"
and
i
kept
coming
in
and
coming
out.
they
call
"it,"
earned
media.
i
earned
it.
i
kept
coming
in
and
coming
"out,"
and
every
time
i
left
they
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
think
we'll
lose
in
north
"carolina.\""
you
know
what?
i
was
right.
we
won
it.
we
won
it
easily.
we
won
it
easily.
so
i
just
want
to
thank
everybody.
seriously.
this
is
a
big…
that
was
a
big
deal.
november
"8th,"
that
was
a
big
deal.
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
north
carolina.
a
big
deal.
that
was
when
you
started
to
see
the
folks
at
a
certain
other
"convention,"
beautiful
looking
place.
one
of
the
most
beautiful
venues
i've
ever
"seen,"
but
i
don't
want
any
part
of
it.
it
was
unlucky.
i
don't
want
any
"part,"
but
that's
when
you
saw
the
people
"say,"
what
the
hell
is
going
on?
what?
what's
happening?
and
then
it
was
state
after
"state,"
it
was
"florida,"
it
was
south
"carolina,"
we
love
south
carolina.
right?
unbelievable.
it
was
pennsylvania.
remember
they
wouldn't
announce
the
numbers
in
"pennsylvania,"
so
there
was
1%
of
the
vote
remaining.
if
i
lost
every
one
of
those
"votes,"
we
still
win
by
a
"lot,"
and
they
wouldn't
announce
it.
they
wouldn't
announce
it.
and
then
we
won
the
great
state
of
wisconsin.
first
time
in
"many,"
many
"decades,"
that
a
republican
won.
and
then
we
had
a
"surprise,"
but
not
a
surprise
to
"us,"
because
we're
bringing
back
the
auto
industry.
we
brought
so
much
back
to
the
great
state
of
michigan.
that
was
a
"shocker,"
remember
that?
do
you
remember
a
certain
hand
on
that
beautiful
board
and
they
"said,"
"\"you"
know
this
sport
is
getting
awfully
"red.\""
that's
republican.
"\"there's"
a
lot
of
red
up
"there.\""
we
had
a
lot
of…
that
was
one
hell
of
a
"night,"
wasn't
it
though?
one
hell
of
a
night.
i
think
it
was
"maybe,"
you
know
there
are
those
that
"say,"
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
exciting
evenings
in
the
history
of
television
and
the
history
of
anything.
and
you
"know,"
you
can
"go,"
all
over
the
world
in
some
"cases,"
it
was
morning.
you
go
to
"asia,"
you
go
to
"europe,"
you
go
all
over.
it
was
just
record
setting
and
here's
the
"point,"
we
have
to
do
it
again.
we
have
to
do
it
again.
and
the
reason
we
have
to
not
only
to
do
new
"things,"
which
we
"will,"
and
you
know
statutorily
and
we
had
all
sorts
of
artificial
witch
hunts
over
our
head.
can
you
imagine
if
we
didn't
have
to
go
through
that
hoax?
i
don't
know
that
we
would've
done
any
better
to
be
honest
with
you.
i
think
we've
done
more
in
two
and
a
half
years
than
any
president
ever<
first
two
and
a
half
years.
but
could
you
imagine
what
it
could
have
been
if
we
didn't
have
the
witch
hunt?
you
said
it.
he
said
it.
i
won't
say
it
because
it's
a
"harrell,"
it's
a
terrible
word.
so
i
will
not
say
that
this
guy
"said,"
if
we
didn't
have
the
"bullshit,"
that's
all.
"no,"
no.
could
you
imagine
if
we
didn't
have
the
time
wasted
the
time
and
everything.
can
you
imagine?
and
you
know
a
friend
of
mine
said
maybe
you
wouldn't
have
done
as
well.
is
that
possible?
that
can
happen.
maybe
we
would
have
had
too
much
time
on
our
hands.
who
knows?
but
i
can
"say,"
nobody
in
their
first
two
and
a
half
years
has
done
anywhere
close
to
what
we
not
being
what
"we,"
not
"me,"
what
we've
all
done.
it's
true.
the
unemployment
rate
among
african
americans
is
the
lowest
in
the
history
of
our
country.
unemployment
among
hispanic
"americans,"
where
we're
doing
really
"well,"
you
know
why?
because
they
want
a
strong
border.
they
want
it
because
they
understand
the
border
better
than
anybody.
they
want
that
strong
border.
they
want
that
wall
that's
being
built
right
now.
they
want
that
"wall,"
and
they
really
do.
they
understand
the
border
better
than
"anybody,"
and
they
don't
want
criminals
coming
in.
they
don't
want
crime
"coming,"
they
don't
want
to
lose
their
jobs.
they
like
the
fact
that
their
salaries
are
going
"up,"
their
wages
are
going
"up,"
they
understand
it
better.
so
hispanic
"american,"
the
best
unemployment
numbers
in
our
"history,"
asian
"americans,"
the
best
unemployment
numbers
in
our
history.
and
likewise
"women,"
74
years.
so
i'm
sorry
"women,"
i
let
you
down.
it's
not
in
our
"history,"
but
we're
going
to
be
there
very
soon.
we're
going
to
be
there
very
soon.
women
are
doing
incredibly
and
women…
the
men
are
going
to
get
angry.
sorry
men.
"whoa,"
look
at
all
those
signs.
women
for
trump.
"wow,"
thank
you.
that's
a
lot
of
signs.
you
remember
last
"election,"
donald
trump
will
never
ever
get
the
women.
then
we
got
this
tremendous
number
of
women.
we
got
this
tremendous
number
of
"women,"
and
during
the
election
"night,"
they
"say,"
"\"what's"
going
"on?\""
you
know
it's
called
suppression
polls.
suppression.
polls
are
just
as
fake
as
the
news
"itself,"
but
women
filled
"60%,"
and
i'm
sorry
to
tell
you
"this,"
"men,"
they're
going
to
sue
me
for
discrimination
now.
women
fill
60%
of
all
of
the
new
jobs
created
last
year.
women
took
"60%,"
what's
wrong
with
"you,"
men?
what's
wrong
with
you?
but
the
radical
democrats
are
trying
to
destroy
all
of
our
country's
tremendous
"achievement,"
and
our
country's
tremendous
success.
unprecedented.
we've
had
unprecedented
success.
leaders
come
in
from
other
"countries,"
prime
"ministers,"
"presidents,"
"kings,"
"queens,"
dictators.
"sometimes,"
i
hate
to
say
"it,"
"dictators,"
and
they
all
start
off
by
"saying,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
i'd
like
to
congratulate
you
on
the
incredible
economy
that
you've
created.
the
greatest
anywhere
in
the
world
by
"far.\""
and
"sadly,"
china
who
i
have
a
very
good
relationship
with
president
"xi,"
i
really
like
him.
but
china
has
had…
yesterday
it
was
"announced,"
the
worst
year
in
27
years.
we've
had
the
"best,"
and
if
our
opponent
ever
got
into
"office,"
instead
of
being
"up,"
62%
instead
of
those
401ks
of
yours
being
up
"60,"
"70,"
"80,"
"90%,"
"crash,"
big
crash.
you
would
have
had
a
"crash,"
the
likes
of
which
we
have
never
seen
"before,"
if
they
got
in
office.
because
we
freed
up
our
"country,"
we
freed
up
our
economy
especially
with
regulation
"cuts,"
but
also
with
those
big
beautiful
tax
cuts.
we
freed
it
up.
the
leading
voices
of
the
democrat
party
are
left
wing
"extremists,"
who
reject
everything
our
nation
stands
for.
but
"again,"
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
this
vote
was
so
big.
i
have
to
thank
many
of
the
democrats.
i
"mean,"
that
was
amazing.
"no,"
"no,"
i
really
do.
i
respect
it.
i
really
do.
that
was
a
"slaughter,"
but
many
of
those
people
that
voted
for
us
this
afternoon
in
somewhat
of
a
sneak
"attack,"
a
real
sneak
"attack,"
many
of
those
people
that
voted
for
us
were
"democrats,"
and
i
want
to
thank
"them,"
because
they
did
the
right
thing
for
our
country.
republicans
know
that
america
is
the
greatest
force
for
peace
and
justice
in
the
history
of
our
world.
but
these
left-wing
ideologues
see
our
nation
as
a
force
of
evil.
the
way
they
"speak,"
so
badly
of
our
country.
they
want
to
demolish
our
"constitution,"
weaken
our
"military,"
eliminate
the
values
that
built
this
magnificent
country.
you
have
to
look
at
some
of
their
recent
comments
which
are
never
talked
about.
when
you
see
the
four
congress
women.
"oh,"
isn't
that
lovely?
i'll
give
you
just
a
"couple,"
i've
had
pages
and
"pages,"
but
we
don't
want
to
bore
you.
we
don't
want
to
go
too
long.
but
we
have
to
give
a
"couple,"
because
that's
the
great
thing
about
live
television.
they
can't
cut
it.

by
the

i
keep
hearing
how
much

is

don't
think

they're
just

gone

far

were
trying
to
keep
peace
in
somalia.
omar
minimized
the
september
11th
attacks
on
our
"homeland,"
saying
some
people
did
something.
i
don't
think
so.
some
people
did
something.
"yeah,"
some
people
did
something.
all
right.
she
pleaded
for
compassion
for
isis
recruits
attempting
to
join
the
terrorist
organization.
she
was
looking
for
compassion.
omar
laughed
that
americans
speak
of
al-qaeda
in
a
menacing
tone
and
remark
"that,"
you
don't
say
america
with
this
intensity.
you
"say,"
al-qaeda
makes
you
proud.
al-qaeda
makes
you
proud.
you
don't
speak
that
way
about
america.
and
at
a
press
conference
just
this
week
when
asked
whether
she
supported
"al-qaeda,"
that's
our
enemy.
that's
our
enemy.
they
are
a
very
serious
problem
that
we
take
care
"of,"
but
they
always
seem
to
come
along
somewhere.
she
refused
to
answer.
she
didn't
want
to
give
an
answer
to
that
question.
omar
blamed
the
united
states
for
the
crisis
in
venezuela.
i
mean
think
of
that
"one,"
and
she
looks
down
with
contempt
on
the
hardworking
"american,"
saying
that
ignorance
is
pervasive
in
many
parts
of
this
country.
and
obviously
and
"importantly,"
omar
has
a
history
of
launching
vicious
antisemitic
screens.
when
she
talked
about
the
evil
"israel,"
and
it's
all
about
the
benjamins.
not
a
good
thing
to
say.
so
that's
omar.
that's
omar.
and
by
the
"way,"
many
other
"things,"
all
you
have
to
do
is
press
the
right
button
on
your
beautiful
"screen,"
and
you'll
see
thing
after…
you
didn't
hear
this
over
the
last
two
days
or
did
you
hear
anybody
talk
about
this?
her
colleague
representative
rashida
"tlaib,"
agreed
with
omar's
characterization
of
9/11
and
said
that
members
of
congress
who
support
israel
"forgot,"
what
country
they
represent.
and
tlaib
also
used
the
f
word
to
describe
the
presidency
and
your
president.
that's
not
"nice,"
even
for
me.
she
was
describing
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
presidency
with
the
big
fat
"vicious,"
the
way
she
said
"it,"
vicious
f-word.
that's
not
somebody
that
loves
our
country.
representative
alexandria
ocasio-cortez.
check
out
her
scores
by
the
"way,"
with
her
green
new
"deal,"
the
green
new
deal.
where
did
that
come
from?
she's
conducted
outrageous
attacks
against
men
and
women
of
law
"enforcement,"
she
compared
american
border
agents
managing
a
humanitarian
"crisis,"
that
i
always
said
was
a
humanitarian
"crisis,"
and
they
said
it
was
manufactured.
they
don't
say
it
was
"manufactured,"
and
we're
stopping
it
and
i
want
to
thank
mexico.
they've
got
"21,000"
soldiers
now
stopping
people
from
coming
into
our
country.
but
"cortez,"
somebody
said
that's
not
her
name
it's…
they
said
that's
not
her
"name,"
sir.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
i
don't
have
time
to
go
with
three
different
"names.\""
we'll
call
her
cortez.
too
much
time.
takes
too
much
time.
so
cortez
"also,"
she
said
essentially
nazis
are
running
concentration
"camps,"
and
when
mike
pence
went
down
just
a
few
days
ago
with
members
of
congress
and
the
"media,"
and
you
looked
at
those
so-called
horrible
concentration
"camps,"
they
"said,"
"\"wow,"
these
places
a
clean.
wow.
they
have
air
"conditioning,"
they
have
"water.\""
and
you
"know,"
to
be
"honest,"
it's
not
like
they
came
and
we
want
to
take
care
of
people.
we
got
to
straighten
out
our
immigration
laws.
you
"know,"
in
a
very
short
period
of
"time,"
if
the
democrats
would
give
us
a
few
"votes,"
we
could
solve
the
immigration
problem
and
it
would
be
so
great.
it
would
be
so
great.
but
these
kids
and
these
people
come
from
rough
places.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
some
of
them
"said,"
"\"we've"
never
lived
like
this
"before.\""
they
have
"water,"
they
have
air
"conditioning,"
they
have
things
that
they've
never
seen.
and
we
listen
to
her
talking
about
drinking
water
from
"toilets,"
which
was
a
"lie,"
which
was
a
lie.
cortez
said
that
illegal
immigrants
are
more
american
than
any
person
who
seeks
to
keep
them
out
ever
will
"be,"
can
you
believe
that?
that's
what
she
say.
she
described
contemporary
"america,"
that's
"you,"
that's
"me,"
that's
all
of
"us,"
as
"garbage,"
"garbage,"
a
garbage.
remember
"deplorables,"
right?
that
sounds
worse.
i
think
that's
"worse,"
but
we'll
save
it
for
whoever's
going
to
be
the
"nominee,"
and
right
"now,"
sleepy
joe's
not
looking
too
"good,"
pocahontas.
pocahontas
is
gaining
a
little
"bit,"
because
we
probably
use
the
pocahontas
a
little
bit
too
"early,"
but
that's
okay.
we'll
bring
it
out
of
retirement
very
soon.
they
have
a
new
one
who
knocked
the
hell
out
of
biden
during
the
debate?
he
"said,"
"\"i"
wasn't
prepared
for
that
"question.\""
that's
not
a
good
answer.
can
you
imagine?
and
according
to
the
"polls,"
i
won
every
single
debate
republican
and
against
hillary.
can
you
imagine?
those
are
the
polls.
they
won't
admit
that.
"many,"
many
polls.
but
can
you
imagine
if
i
"said,"
"\"uh-oh,"
i'm
sorry
i
wasn't
prepared
for
that
"question.\""
i'm
gone.
that's
the
end
of
trump.
he's
not
prepared.
he's
not
mentally
"prepared,"
that's
his
problem.
but
everybody
that
knows
him
knows
that.
but
no
harris
hit
him
with
the
pretty
easy
question
on
busing.
what
i
would
say
that's
pretty
"easy,"
and
he
choked.
he
choked.
and
then
he
"said,"
"\"ah,"
"yeah,"
i'm
sorry
i
ran
out
of
time.
i
ran
out
of
"time\""
he
ran
out
of
time.
and
then
you
have
a
young
"guy,"
"buttigieg,"
buttigieg.
they're
saying
how
to
say
his
"name,"
buut-ih-jij.
he's
a
beauty.
he
runs
a
failed
city.
his
city
is
doing
so
badly.
mike
pence
was
the
governor
of
that
state.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
was
he
as
the
"mayor?\""
mike
is
one
of
the
nicest
human
beings
you'll
ever
meet.
and
mike
"said,"
he
never
did
a
good
"job,"
i'm
so
shocked
to
see
him
running.
okay.
and
then
he
goes
back
"home,"
and
african
americans
literally
were
so
angry
at
him
for
the
lousy
job
and
he's
supposed
to
be
like
a
hot
young
"star,"
if
that's
a
hot
young
"star,"
i
guess
i
just
don't
no
star
anymore.
that
is
not
as
star.
that's
not
a
star.
"buut-ih-jij,"
you
"say,"
"buut,"
and
then
add
"ih-jij,"
buttigieg.
i
don't
see
him
dealing
with
president
xi
of
china.
i
don't
see
him
meeting
successfully
with
kim
jong-un.
i
don't
see
him
"dealing,"
and
nobody
has
been
tougher
with
russia
than
donald
trump.
i
don't
know
see
him
dealing
with
vladimir
putin.
and
we
have
good
relationships
with
them
and
many
"others,"
except
now
we're
no
longer
the
suckers.
like
with
"nato,"
we
protect
europe.
we
spent
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
and
they're
not
paying
their
fair
share.
so
last
year
i
went
and
"said,"
"\"folks,"
"sorry,"
you
got
to
pay
your
fair
"share.\""
16
years
was
going
like
this?
the
"contribution,"
and
now
it's
like
a
rocket
"ship,"
$100
billion.
i
said
to
"him,"
great
"people,"
28
"nations,"
including
the
"us,"
i
said
to
"him,"
"\"listen,"
we're
taking
care
of
you.
you
screw
us
on
"trade,"
and
you
don't
pay
your
military
bills.
this
is
not
a
good
deal
for
the
united
"states.\""
so
we're
taking
care
of
trade.
we
want
to
do
it
nice
and
slow
and
easy.
you
"know,"
we
got
a
world
"balance,"
but
european
union
is
terrible
to
us
on
"trade,"
terrible.
"frankly,"
they're
as
tough
or
tougher
than
"china,"
just
smaller
in
numbers.
that's
the
only
difference.
with
"china,"
507
billion
"dollars,"
a
you
look
over
the
"years,"
for
"many,"
many
"years,"
they've
been
taken.
and
guys
like
biden
"say,"
"\"uh-oh,"
we'd
them
"them.\""
and
he
was
there
eight
"years,"
"\"we'd"
stop
"that.\""
"no,"
trump
is
stopping
it.
trump
is
stopping
it.
representative
ayanna
pressle.
is
she
related
in
any
way
to
elvis?
i
don't
know.
who
knows?
you
never
know.
she
thinks
that
people
with
the
same
skin
"color,"
all
need
to
think
the
same
or
military.
you
know
they're
attacking
a
single
man
standing
there
with
a
"camera,"
who
never
got
hit
and
never
hit
back
before
in
his
life
that.
they're
very
brave.
they
always
show
up
with
a
mask
and
they're
covered.
because
then
they
go
home
to
mom
and
dad.
they
don't
want
mom
and
dad
to
know
where
they
were.
but
they
always
attract
people
that
really
can't
defend
themselves
very
well.
right?
they're
attacking
this
group.
they're
not
attack
north
carolina.
that's
for
sure.
so
these
"congresswomen,"
their
comments
are
helping
to
fuel
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
militant
hard
"left,"
but
that's
"so,"
they
are
very
evil.
they're
hitting
people
over
the
head
with
"sticks,"
and
i
mean
sticks.
i
mean
bats
"even,"
they're
whacking
people
with
bats.
they're
very
brave.
they
always
show
up
with
a
mask
and
they're
"covered,"
because
then
they
go
home
to
mom
and
dad.
they
don't
want
mom
and
dad
to
know
where
they
were.
but
they
always
attract
people
that
really
can't
defend
themselves
very
well.
right?
they're
attacking
this
group.
they're
not
attack
north
carolina.
that's
for
sure.
so
these
"congresswomen,"
their
comments
are
helping
to
fuel
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
militant
hard
"left,"
but
that's
"okay,"
because
we're
going
to
win
this
election
like
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
and
tonight
i
have
a
suggestion
for
the
hate
filled
"extremists,"
who
are
constantly
trying
to
tear
our
country
down.
they
never
have
anything
good
to
say.
that's
why
i
"say,"
"\"hey,"
if
they
don't
like
"it,"
let
them
leave.
let
them
leave.
let
them
leave.
let
them
"leave.\""
they're
always
telling
us
how
to
run
"it,"
how
to
do
"this,"
how
to
the…
you
know
what?
if
they
don't
love
"it,"
tell
them
to
leave
it.
i
don't
know.
and
i'll
"watch,"
i'll
go
back
to
"the,"
"\"oh"
"sir,"
that
was
so
"controversial,"
"sir.\""
"no,"
i'm
just
saying
it's
their
choice.
they
can
come
back
when
they
"want,"
but
you
"know,"
they
don't
love
our
"country,"
i
think
in
some
cases
they
hate
our
country.
and
it's
so
"angry,"
even
yesterday
they
went
on
the
stage.
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
watch
"this.\""
and
the
"anger,"
they
were
trying
to
be
"nice,"
but
it's
hard.
it's
hard
for
them
to
do
that.
that
choice
for
every
american
has
never
been
more
clear.
that's
true.
the
democrat
agenda
is
anti
"worker,"
anti
"jobs,"
anti
citizen
anti-family
and
anti
common
sense.
with
the
exception
of
all
of
those
democrats
that
voted
for
us
"today,"
we'll
give
them
"up,"
okay?
they're
"fine,"
they're
fine.
they
are
fine
and
you'll
lose
to
"them,"
it's
different.
it's
okay.
it's
called
normal
political
back
and
forth.
but
i
want
to
tell
you
"something,"
the
democrats
are
being
"violent,"
so
"vicious,"
moving
so
far
"left,"
it's
out
of
control.
it's
out
of
control.
the
republican
agenda
is
"pro-worker,"
"pro-jobs,"
"pro-family,"
"pro-growth,"
and
100%
pro-american.
so
we're
thrilled
tonight
to
be
joined
by
several
north
carolina
republican
leaders.
really
great
people.
they've
been
so
helpful
to
me
and
they're
doing
an
incredible
job.
lieutenant
"governor,"
dan
"forest,"
lieutenant
governor.
north
"carolina,"
treasurer
dale
folwell.
greenville
"mayor,"
pj
"connelly,"
i
hear
he
does
a
good
"job,"
pj.
and
north
carolina
gop
"chair,"
michael
whatley
incredible
ncaa
wrestling
"champion,"
great
guy.
he
wanted
to
stay
back.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
sure
you
don't
want
to
"come?\""
"\"i"
do
want
to
"come,"
but
i
really
want
you
to
win
"today,"
if
you
don't
"mind.\""
i
"said,"
"\"okay,"
you
better
stay
back.
if
i
see
you
here
i'm
going
to
be
very
"angry.\""
and
they
did
their
"job,"
didn't
they?
this
man
is
from
the
great
state
of
"ohio,"
congressman
jim
jordan.
we're
going
to
do
this
"quickly,"
but
it's
just
important
that
you
get
out
and
"vote,"
they're
two
great
people.
i
want
to
introduce
the
next
member
of
congress
from
north
carolina's
third
congressional
"district,"
just
won
a
great
"race,"
dr.
greg
murphy.
greg
is
a
winner.
so
you
know
greg
would
be
great
on
"jobs,"
all
the
things
you
"want,"
tough
on
"crime,"
strong
on
"borders,"
pushing
the
"wall,"
he'll
be
pushing
it
like
nobody.
we're
building
the
wall
but
we're
pushing
it.
it's
like
pulling
teeth.
we've
got
six
lawsuits
on
the
"wall,"
we've
won
two
of
"them,"
we're
going
to
win
others.
but
you
think
it's
"easy,"
don't
you
"folks,"
you
think
this
is
easy?
but
we're
building
a
lot
of
wall
and
we
hope
if
we
can
win
that
final
"one,"
it's
so
important
it's
going
before
the
supreme
"court,"
we'll
have
over
400
miles
of
wall
built
by
the
end
of
next
year.
so
go
"out,"
get
greg
elected.
great
"victory,"
by
the
"way,"
that
was
a
great
primary
and
a
great
victory.
that
same
day
there's
another
crucial
election
in
north
carolina's
9th…
"right,"
you
know
what
we're
talking
about?
"9th,"
i
know
it's
not
"here,"
but
it's
very
"close,"
right?
9th
congressional
district.
the
democrat
in
the
race
is
an
ultra
liberal
named
dan
"mccready,"
he
wants
to
take
away
your
"guns,"
he
wants
to
raise
you
"taxes,"
he
doesn't
care
about
"borders,"
he
likes
open
borders.
and
he
really
admires
"socialism,"
i
don't
think
that
works
too
well
in
north
carolina.
doesn't
work
too
well
in
our
country.
we're
joined
tonight
by
the
republican
candidate
who
is
really
a
special
"man,"
a
great
"man,"
he's
going
to
be
a
"great,"
great
"congressman,"
dan
bishop.
dan?
thank
"you,"
dan.
thank
you
dan.
and
he
will
indeed
defend
your
"values,"
your
"family,"
and
he
will
always
defend
our
second
amendment
unlike
the
opponents.
they're
really
into
destroying
our
second
amendment.
who've
been
violently
operating
for
more
than
10
"years,"
we
got
them
"all,"
we
think
they
are
no
good.
with
conducting
"brutal,"
medieval
style
"killings,"
you
know
what
medieval
style
is?
okay.
little
"pieces,"
little
"pieces,"
little
"pieces,"
medieval
"style,"
including
the
dismemberment
of
their
"victims,"
and
they
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it.
these
are
sick
people.
when
i
call
them
"animals,"
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
"\"how"
dare
he
used
that
name?
these
are
human
"beings.\""
i
don't
think
they're
human
beings.
most
of
those
indicted
were
in
our
country
"illegally,"
19
to
be
"exact,"
19
of
22.
think
of
"that,"
they
want
to
protect…
these
are
savage
"beasts,"
these
are
savage
"killers,"
and
they
should've
been
brought
out
a
long
time
ago
by
the
obama
administration.
we're
bringing
ms-13
out
by
the
"thousands,"
getting
them
the
hell
out
of
our
county.
and
when
you
read
about
deportation
and
"sunday,"
we've
got
a
lot
of
people
on
"sunday,"
but
we
have
a
lot
of
people…
and
we're
always
shooting
for
the
bad
ones
first.
which
makes
"sense,"
"right,"
but
when
you
hear
about
"that,"
we
always
want
to
get…
and
by
the
"way,"
do
you
know
how
dangerous
it
is
for
these
ice
"agents,"
these
ice
and
border
patrol?
but
"ice,"
they
go
into
a
"nest,"
they
call
it
a
"nest,"
a
nest
of
these
killers.
they're
"tough,"
they're
"smart,"
and
you
know
"what,"
they're
great
"patriots,"
they
love
our
country.
the
danger
that
they
have
is
incredible.
and
i
just
want
to
salute…
and
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
i
want
to
salute
ice
and
border
"patrol,"
and
i
want
to
support
and
salute
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states.
these
are
great
people.
these
are
great
people
and
they
don't
get
the
credit
that
they
"deserve,"
but
you
know
what?
i
tell
them
all
the
"time,"
you
have
no
idea
how
much
the
american
"people,"
the
american
"public,"
you
have
no
idea
how
much
they
love
you
and
respect
"you,"
law
enforcement.
in
the
recent
democratic
"debate,"
every
single
"candidate,"
"everyone,"
biden
was
a
little
bit
slower
with
the
"hand,"
it
didn't
work
so
well.
they
raised
their
hand
in
favor
of
giving
free
government
healthcare.
they
raised
their
hand
in
giving
a
lot
of
other
things
that
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
be
happy
"with,"
illegal
aliens
will
be
very
nicely
covered.
how
about
"california,"
they
just
approved
a
$100
million?
they
just
approved
$100
million
to
take
care
of
the
needs
of
illegal
"immigrants,"
and
then
you
look
on
the
sidewalks
of
los
"angeles,"
the
sidewalks
of
san
"francisco,"
nancy
pelosi's
"district,"
nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like
it
in
the
history
of
our
country
what's
happening
there.
so
if
you
don't
want
democrats
to
raid
your
"healthcare,"
to
steal
away
your
"money,"
to
bankrupt
your
"country,"
then
you
have
a
"choice,"
you
must
vote
republican.
all
american
"citizens,"
including
millions
and
millions
of
legal
immigrants
who
work
hard
to
come
into
our
"country,"
who
"study,"
who
wait
on
line
sometimes
for
10
"years,"
and
who
respect
our
laws
and
follow
the
"rules,"
they
deserve
a
government
that
is
loyal
to
them.
they
work
hard.
you
can't
say
you
love
our
country
if
you
want
to
destroy
it
through
open
"borders,"
open
borders
are
a
disaster.
human
"trafficking,"
the
first
time
i
heard
as
a
"politician,"
human
"trafficking,"
nobody
talks
about
"it,"
it
sounded
almost
like
an
ancient
"crime,"
"many,"
many
years
"ago,"
hundreds
of
"years,"
thousands
of
years
"ago,"
human
"trafficking,"
it's
the
worst
now
throughout
the
world
because
of
the
"internet,"
it's
the
worst
it's
ever
been.
and
the
worst
treated
of
"all,"
"children,"
but
it's
"women,"
"women,"
the
democrats
want
to
do
nothing
about
it.
human
trafficking
is
worse
than
it
ever
has
been
in
the
history
of
the
"world,"
not
just…
this
is
not
a
united
states
"problem,"
this
is
all
over
the
world.
human
"trafficking,"
it's
a
"terrible,"
terrible
thing
and
we
got
to
solve
it.
most
of
it
comes
"through,"
in
this
"country,"
our
southern
border
where
we
don't
have
the
wall.
they're
not
going
through
our
"points,"
they're
not
going
through
areas
where
we
have
"security,"
where
we
have
"guards,"
where
we
have
"gates,"
where
we
have
all
sorts
of
"equipment,"
"no,"
they
ride
through
the
desert
and
they
make
a
left
where
you
don't
have
the
wall.
it's
so
"simple,"
everybody
knows
it.
the
democrats
all
know
it
because
five
years
ago
before
i
was
"here,"
they
all
wanted
it.
now
they
don't
want
"it,"
you
know
why
they
don't
want
it?
for
political
"reasons,"
and
you
know
"what,"
it's
going
to
cost
them
a
lot
of
points
in
the
"election,"
i
think
probably
cost
them
the
election
itself.
just
"lastly,"
democrats
also
support
deadly
sanctuary
cities
which
release
violent
criminal
aliens
onto
our
streets.
where
we
just
picked
up
these
22
"thugs,"
these
22
"monsters,"
we
just
picked
him
up
"in,"
"where,"
los
angeles.
sanctuary
"city,"
wonderful
sanctuary
city.
thom
tillis
senator
recently
introduced
a
bill
to
give
american
victims
the
right
to
pursue
sanctuary
cities
and
hold
them
accountable
for
the
thousands
of
lives
they
have
"shattered,"
they've
shattered
these
lives.
thank
you
very
much
thom.
every
nation
has
the
right
to
establish
and
enforce
immigration
rules
in
it's
national
"interest,"
it's
very
"simple,"
isn't
it?
it's
common
"sense,"
it's
so
simple
and
the
voters
understand
that.
we
expect
that
those
who
seek
to
join
our
society
will
obey
our
"laws,"
revere
our
"constitution,"
cherish
our
"history,"
support
themselves
"financially,"
and
embrace
our
american
values
and
love
our
american
flag.
we
believe
in
an
immigration
system
based
on
"merit,"
"merit,"
where
they
come
in.
we
have
so
many
companies
coming
"in,"
automobile
"companies,"
companies
of
all
"types,"
and
we
need
workers.
we
actually
need
workers.
we
have
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
that
we've
had
in
51
"years,"
soon
it'll
be
the
lowest
ever.
we
need
"workers,"
but
they
have
to
come
in
where
they
can
help
our
country.
they
have
to
come
in
based
on
"merit,"
and
we're
putting
in
bills
and
let's
see
what
happens.
"otherwise,"
we'll
just
wait
til
we
win
back
the
"house,"
win
the
"senate,"
win
the
"presidency,"
and
we'll
vote.
democrats
have
never
been
farther
outside
of
the
mainstream.
they're
going
crazy
"folks,"
they're
going
crazy.
more
than
130
democrats
in
congress
have
signed
up
for
bernie
sanders
total
government
takeover
of
"healthcare,"
isn't
that
nice?
this
is
one
of
the
great…
it
won't
"happen,"
he
knows
that.
the
guy
never
passed
the
"bill,"
he
did
nothing.
he's
actually
not
even
a
"democrat,"
isn't
he
an
independent?
i
don't
"know,"
he's
running
but…
he
missed
his
time.
hey
"bernie,"
let
me
save
you
a
lot
of
time
and
"effort,"
"bernie,"
you
missed
your
time.
it
got
taken
from
you
four
years
"ago,"
bernie.
not
doing
too
well.
he's
not
doing
too
"well,"
but
that's
okay.
i
got
to
hand
it
to
him
he's
up
there
ranting
and
raving
and
going
like
a
lunatic.
i
said
to
our
first
lady
the
other
"day,"
i
was
watching
bernie
and
he's
"screaming,"
his
hair's
all
"crazy,"
i'm
going
to
do
"this,"
i'm
going
to
do
"that,"
no
more
college
"loans,"
no
more
cost
for
anything.
"nothing,"
you're
not
going
to
pay
for
anything.
he's
desperate
"now,"
he's
desperate.
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
anything.
i
"joke,"
i
"said,"
"\"and"
everybody
will
get
a

and
the

"said,"
"\"donald"

is
exaggerating.
he
knows
that
they're
not
getting
a
"rolls-royce.\""
i'm
"sorry,"
don't
put
it.
don't
put
that
i
said
free
rolls
royce.
but
bernie's
desperate
"now,"
i
watch
him
up
there
it's
a
sad
situation.
but
i
think
they're
all
sad
when
you
get
right
down
to
it.
for
"instance,"
we're
in
this
incredible
state
north
"carolina,"
that
you
have
your
best

that
you've

forget
the
country
for
a
"second,"
you
have
the
best

you've
ever
"had,"
you
have
your
best
unemployment

you
had
the
most

what
are

just

"\"north"

i'm
going
to
do

you
have
the
best

in

in

so
i
don't
"know,"
and
we
won
by
a
lot.
and
we
won
by
a
lot
i
was
telling
"mike,"
i
was
telling
my
son
eric

and
lara's
"here,"

do

do
you

went

and
brad

is
"here,"
the

in

he's
the

in

most
"importantly,"
he's
the

the

he's
the

thank
"you,"
brad.
great
job.
and
he
just
told
me
our
poll
numbers
are
through
the
"roof,"
he
just
told
me
that
so
i'll
take
that.
we
are
a
year
and
a
half
"away,"
but
we're
doing
"well,"
you
see
it.
you'd
"know,"
you'd
be
the
first
to
know.
number
"one,"
you
wouldn't
be
"here,"
you
wouldn't
be

we
haven't
had
an
empty
seat
in
any
"event,"
i
don't
"believe,"
that
we've
ever
been
"to,"
i
don't
think
we've
ever
had…
we
always
have
"people,"
we
haven't
had
an

you
look
"anywhere,"
north
"carolina,"
"ohio,"
no
matter
where
we
go
we
pack
it
and
we
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
"people,"
we
put
screens
outside.
i
know
tonight's
not
so
"good,"
we
got
a
hundred
degrees
"out,"
but
you
still
have
thousands
of
people
out
there.
we
could
have
sold
this
arena
"out,"
you
know
that.
we
could
have
sold
this

out
tonight
10
"times,"
can
you
believe
that?
10
times.
i
think
that's
like
a
"poll,"
that's
like
a
poll
because
when
biden
goes
out
i
see
sleepy
joe
and
he
"says,"
"\"they"
had
115
people
show
"up,"
115

that's
our
first
"row.\""
the
democratic
record
on
healthcare
is
one
of
deception
and
"destruction,"
the
last
administration
said
a
lie.
if
you
like
your
"plan,"
you
can
keep
your
"plan,"
if
you
like
your
"doctor,"
you
can
keep
your
"doctor,"
28
"times,"
a
total
lie.
my
administration
is
defending
your
sacred
right
to
choose
the
doctor
and
the
plan
that
you
"want,"
and
we
are
offering
plans
up
to
60%
cheaper
than
"obamacare,"
and
a
lot
of
people
are
starting
to
figure
that
out.
better
healthcare.
and
we'll
also
always
protect…
you
have
to
remember
"this,"
you
"ready,"
because
they
give
us
a
bum
rap.
patients
with
preexisting
conditions
are
protected
by
republicans
much
more
so
than
protected
by
democrats
who
will
never
be
able
to
pull
it
off.
preexisting
"conditions,"
and
you
"know,"
the
job
we've
done
on
"healthcare,"
it's
not
talked
"about,"
but
we're
also
doing
something.
it's
been
"phenomenal,"
we
have
180
million
people
right
now
really
happy
on
private
"plans,"
and
you
know
"what,"
they're
going
to
be
taken
away.
under
the
democrats
plan
all
of
those
people
that
are
thrilled
where
they
went
out
and
negotiated
cross
state
"lines,"
all
of
the
things
they
"did,"
they
went
"out,"
negotiated
great
private
"plans,"
it's
all
going
to
be
taken
away
from
you
under
this
plan.
"now,"
i
only
hope
they
don't
change
because
we're
talking
too
"soon,"
we
got
a
year
and
a
half
left.
it's
like
when
i
called
"pocahontas,"
"pocahontas,"
i
should've
waited
six
months
because
she
then
went
out
and
got
that
test.
"1024th,"
and
i've
always
said
i
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
she
has
in
"her,"
and
i
have
none.
i
have
"none,"
but
it's
more
than
she
"has,"
1024.
i
brought
it
up
too
soon
so
i
don't
talk
about
it
"anymore,"
but
if
she
should
be
the
"candidate,"
which
i
tend
to
"doubt,"
but
if
she
should
be
we'll
bring
it
up
again
and
i
think
it
will
be
very
successful.
"1024,"
how
about
"this,"
i
was
driving
her
"crazy,"
so
she
went
out
and
hired
a
guy
to
check
the
blood.
i'm
sure
he
had
a
lot
of
fun
doing
that.
he
checked
her
blood
and
found
out
that
"many,"
"many,"
"many,"
"many,"
"many,"
many
years
"ago,"
there
could
have
been
somebody
and
he
could
have
been
indian.
and
then
the
indians
got
together
and
they
"said,"
"\"we"
don't
want
"her.\""
we
want
"trump,"
we
want
"trump,"
they
want
trump.
we've
taken
historic
action
to
fight
the
opioid
"epidemic,"
what
a
"problem,"
and
just
today
it
was
just
announced
before
i
came
"in,"
that
drug
overdose
deaths…
we're
working
so
hard
on
"this,"
including
our
vice
"president,"
including
our
first
"lady,"
including
everybody
in
the
trump
"administration,"
it's
dropped
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
30
"years,"
it's
gone
down.
first
"time,"
it
was
a
big
problem.
and
in
north
carolina
and
we're
far
from
"finished,"
it's
a
big
"problem,"
it
declined
8%
last
year.
that's
a
lot
because
it
was
just
going
up
like
a
rocket.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
womb
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
well
then
you
have
the
gentleman
from…
our
governor
from
"virginia,"
so
we're
talking
about
late
"term,"
he's
talking
about
the
baby
is
born
before
the
mother
makes
the
decision.
that's
the
first
i've
heard
of
"it,"
that's
the
first
most
of
you
have
heard
of
"it,"
and
then
they
pass
legislation
in
various
states
saying
that's
okay.
this
is
a
baby
that's
"born,"
this
isn't
late
term.
this
is
a
baby
that's
born.
nobody's
ever
heard
anything
like
"that,"
nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like
it.
nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like
it.
and
that
"actually,"
when
he
had
the
"scandal,"
that
"became,"
can
you
believe
it?
the
second
biggest
story.
can
you
believe
"that,"
how
important
it
is
and
yet
that
was
the
second
biggest
"story,"
and
what
a
shame
when
that's
the
second
biggest
story.
what
happened
to
our
values?
republicans
believe
that
every
life
is
a
sacred
gift
of
god.
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
of
babies.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
abortion
intolerance
and
division.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
for
all
americans
and
american
values.
we
are
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
we
are
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
this
is
the
proud
banner
the
republican
party
will
carry
into
the
republican
national
convention
next
summer
in
the
great
city
of
"charlotte,"
north
carolina.
don't
disappoint
"me,"
that
should
be
good
for
at
least
10
"points,"
right?
these
are
some
of
the
greatest
"ladies,"
i
see
them
in
"ohio,"
and
florida.
we
love
you
"too,"
thank
"you,"
really.
how
many
have
you
been
"to,"
just
out
of
curiosity?
what's
the
number?
all
but
"two,"
i've
done
hundreds
of
them.
and
then
they
say
women
don't
like
"trump,"
i
think
they
do.
now
i
see
"them,"
they're
great.
great
"ladies,"
you're
great.
it's
interesting
with
"women,"
so
women
want
to
have
a
strong
military
"protection,"
they
want
to
have
strong
"borders,"
they
want
to
have
strong
law
"enforcement,"
they
want
to
have
great
"education,"
they
want
to
have
low
taxes
for
their
"family,"
not
high
taxes.
they
want
to
have
all
the
things
that
we
talk
"about,"
why
wouldn't
they
want
trump
more
than
anybody
else?
the
other
side
is
going
to
go
the
opposite.
and
they
did
in
the
last
"election,"
and
we're
doing
a
lot
better.
the
difference
"is,"
the
last
election
i
was
a
successful
businessman
running
for
"president,"
i
said
i
was
going
to
do
things.
and
by
the
"way,"
really
successful.
i'm
going
to
show
you
something
someday
"soon,"
i'm
going
to
show
you
something.
they
say
he
was
really
"successful,"
he
wasn't
"successful,"
he's
really
"smart,"
or
he's
really
stupid
but
he's
trying
to
take
over
the
world.
they
have
so
many
"messages,"
he's
really
"stupid,"
then
next
"week,"
donald
trump
has
a
sinister
plot
to
take
over
the
"world,"
he
can't
be
too
"stupid,"
because
they
actually
think
it's
working.
i
saw
one
of
these
so-called
comedians
the
other
day
and
he's
a
pretty
respected
"comedian,"
he
"said,"
he's
not
leaving.
i'm
telling
"you,"
he's
not
"leaving,"
he'll
never
live.
he'll
win
this
election
and
in
"24′,"
i'm
telling
"you,"
he's
not
leaving.
he's
going
to
stay.
so
we
did
through
our
friend
dan
"scavino,"
we
did
a
time
magazine
cover.
i
was
on
so
many
"times,"
i
don't
even
read
this
"thing,"
and
it
"says,"
"trump,"
"2014,"
2018.
but
it
says
20
here's
where
we
"go,"
we
start
at
"16,"
we
go
to
"20,"
we
go
to
"24,"
did
you
see
it?
then
it
says
"28,"
"32,"
"36,"
"40,"
42.
"no,"
we
don't
need
any
more
time.
we
don't
need
any
more
"time,"
we
need
one
more.
a
senator
came
to
my
"office,"
"sir,"
i'm
six
foot
"seven,"
i'm
great.
i'm
six
foot
seven
so
i
can
give
you
great
advice.
i
"said,"
"\"senator,"
i'm
one
for
one
but
it
happened
to
be
the
"president.\""
and
now
i
want
to
be
two
for
"two,"
two
for
two.
two
for
"two,"
so
we
have
"16,"
we
have
"20,"
we
have
"24,"
and
you
know
what's
very
interesting
though?
they
were
really
people
out
there
think
i'm
not
"leaving,"
can
you
believe
it?
"hey,"
maybe
that
is
a
good
"idea,"
let's
think
about
it.
"watch,"
you
want
to
drive
them
"crazy,"
they're
going
to
go
crazy.
all
i
have
to
do
is
"say,"
"\"let's"
think
about
it.
they're
going
to
go
crazy.
"no,"
i
promise
"2024,"
i
leave.
by
that
"time,"
just
so
you
"know,"
by
that
time
our
country
will
be
so
well
"seated,"
it
will
be
so
strong
like
"never,"
"ever,"
in
our
history.
but
everything
that
we
"built,"
low
"taxes,"
strong
"military,"
taking
care
of
our
"vets,"
all
of
the
things
we've
done
can
be
decimated
very
quickly
if
the
wrong
person
gets
in
especially
now.
i've
always
said
2016
was
the
most
important
election
maybe
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
a
lot
of
people
felt
that.
so
i
don't
"know,"
i
can't
say
this
is
more
"important,"
what
we
did
was
a
miracle.
not
to
us
it
"wasn't,"
but
a
lot
of
people
said
it
was
the
greatest
election
we've
ever
had.
there's
never
been
anything
like
"it,"
never
been
such
excitement.
never
been
such
excitement.
but
you
know
"what,"
if
we
don't
win
in
2020
everything
that
we've
"done,"
seriously
"though,"
everything
that
we've
"done,"
your
401's
are
going
to
"crash,"
the
whole
"thing,"
it's
going
to
come
down
like
a
stack
of
cards.
"so,"
in
a
certain
"way,"
let's
say
this
is
of
equal
"importance,"
by
that
time
we'll
have
values
"instilled,"
we'll
have
free
enterprise
"instilled,"
people
are
working
now.
we
have
the
lowest
food
stamps
that
we've
had
in
many
"years,"
lowest
food
stamps
because
people
are
working.
so
i
really
think
it's
at
least
"equal,"
it's
"equal,"
maybe
it's
a
little
"less,"
who
the
hell
knows?
i
just
know
"this,"
it
can
disappear
"very,"
very
quickly.
we
have
to
get
"out,"
we
have
to
vote.
that's
why
i'm
starting
"early,"
can
you
believe
it?
we
have
less…
i
see
all
these
clowns
on
television
i
say
i
guess
we
have
to
counteract
them
a
little
"bit,"
but
this
is
not
what
you
want
"running,"
none
of
"them,"
this
is
not
what
you
want
running
this
incredible
country
of
ours.
every
day
we
make
good
on
the
"motto,"
promises
"made,"
promises
kept.
i've
had
people
back
there
that
don't
like
me
and
somebody
"said,"
very
"nicely,"
that
he's
actually
made
certain
promises
and
he's
actually
kept
more
promises
than
he's
made.
it's
true.
i've
done
things
that
i
never…
i
never
said
we
were
going
to
"get,"
as
an
example
with
our
"vets,"
that
we
going
to
"get,"
"joyce,"
that
we
were
going
to
have
the
ability
to
fire
people
that
don't
treat
our
vets
properly.
we
can
fire
them
now.
they've
been
trying
to
get
that
for
44
"years,"
joyce
had
been
trying
to
get
practically
from
the
"beginning,"
joyce's
so
simple
and
yet
they
never
got
"it,"
nobody
got
it
through.
we're
good
at
getting
things
through.
we've
done
more
than
we
said
we
would.
a
man
i
"know,"
who
i
don't
"like,"
a
"businessman,"
"very,"
"very,"
very
"successful,"
one
of
the
most
successful
but
i
don't
like
"him,"
never
liked
him.
he
never
liked
"me,"
by
the
way.
in
"fact,"
i
would
go
a
step
"further,"
he
cannot
stand
me.
and
i
saw
him
about
two
months
ago
and
he
came
up
to
"me,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
are
you
"doing?\""
very
"warm,"
"hey,"
how
you
doing?
let's
get
out
of
here.
and
he
"said,"
"\"i'm"
doing
"good,"
you're
doing
"good?\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
don't
like
"me,"
and
i
don't
like
you.
i
never
have
liked
"you,"
and
you
never
have
liked
"me,"
but
you're
going
to
support
me
because
you're
a
rich
guy.
and
if
you
don't
support
me
you're
going
to
be
so
goddamn
poor
you're
not
going
to
believe
"it.\""
and
he
said
to
"me,"
"\"mr."
"president.\""
he
calls
me
mr.
"president,"
everybody
calls
me
mr.
"president,"
it's
"true,"
it's
a
funny
thing.
he
"said,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
you're
"right,"
i'm
supporting
"you,"
i
think
you're
doing
a
great
job.
and
maybe
we
didn't
get
"along.\""
but
it's
not
like
he
has
a
"choice,"
he
has
no
choice.
and
on
top
of
"that,"
it's
a
good
choice
because
we've
done
the
right
thing.
and
it
is
funny
with
the
name
mr.
"president,"
i
have
"friends,"
really
good
"friends,"
and
they've
always
called
me
"don,"
"donald,"
"d,"
they
call
me
"anything,"
and
you
lose
all
your
friends
when
you're
president
because
they're
all
afraid
to
talk
to
"you,"
does
that
make
sense?
"no,"
it's
true.
except
for
these
"six,"
"seven,"
ladies
up
"here,"
they
always
talk.
they're
not
intimidated.
"no,"
it's
"true,"
i
have
"guys,"
i
have
wonderful
"friends,"
new
york
"developers,"
tough
"guys,"
smart
"guys,"
they're
"rich,"
they're
"this,"
that.
i
have
middle
of
the
"road,"
i
have
"poor,"
i
have
everybody.
i
have
poor
"guys,"
middle
of
the
"road,"
and
rich
"guys,"
doesn't
matter.
rich
guys
call
"up,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
how
are
you
sir?
it's
"richard.\""
"oh,"
"good,"
"rich,"
hey
"richard,"
loosen
up.
this
is
a
guy
who
used
"to,"
"\"hey"
"don,"
how
you
doing?
let's
go
to
"dinner.\""
now
"you're,"
"\"sir,"
is
everything…
you're
doing
"good,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"richard,"
call
me
donald
like
you
always
"did,"
call
me
donald.
always
call
me
"donald.\""
"okay,"
thank
you
"donald,"
thank
you
very
much.
and
then
two
minutes
"later,"
mr
"president,"
it's
been
so
great
to…
i
lost
all
my
friends.
they've
tightened
"up,"
they've
choked.
you
know
what
that
"is,"
they
choked.
they
can't
breathe
because
people
have
such
respect
for
the
office
of
the
"presidency,"
they
have
respect
for
the
office
of
the
president.
they
have
respect
for
our
country
"again,"
our
country
is
respected
again.
we've
confirmed
more
than
125
federal
judges
to
apply
the
law
as
"written,"
including
two
supreme
court
"justices,"
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh.
we've
launched
a
historic
initiative
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
"drugs,"
and
last
"year,"
i'm
so
proud
of
this
because
we
have
no
help
from
the
democrats.
last
"year,"
for
the
first
time
in
over
50
"years,"
drug
prices
went
down.
and
that
was
for
a
reason.
to
give
former
prisoners
a
second
chance
at
"life,"
we
passed
"groundbreaking,"
criminal
justice
reform.
it's
a
big
"thing,"
prisoners
they've
gotten
out
of
jail
and
they
never
had
an
economy
like
this.
we
did
a
lot
of
"things,"
because
they
get
out
jail
they
don't
have
a
chance.
they
always
go
"back,"
most
of
the
time.
now
they're
coming
out
and
we
have
"programs,"
but
most
of
all
we
have
this
great
economy
where
people
are
hiring
"prisoners,"
and
you
have
to
see
the
reviews
they're
"getting,"
they
getting
phenomenal
reviews.
it's
a
beautiful
"thing,"
it's
a
beautiful
thing
what's
happening
with
"prisoners,"
they
get
out
and
they
can
actually
get
a
job
and
that's
what's
happening
and
we're
very
proud
of
them.
we're
expanding
opportunities
zone
so
that
no
american
is
left
"behind,"
it's
one
of
the
great
successes
the
opportunity
zones.
nobody
talks
about
"it,"
it's
one
of
the
great
successes.
and
thanks
to
our
pledge
to
america's
"workers,"
private
sector
partners
will
provide
apprenticeships
and
job
training
to
9
million
"americans,"
isn't
that
nice?
whenever
i
hear
that
word
"apprentice,"
i
say
i
love
that
"word,"
that
was
a
good
show.
they
"figured,"
you
know
what
we'll
"do,"
we'll
get
arnold
schwarzenegger
to
take
my
"place,"
that
didn't
work
out
too
well.
that
didn't
work
out
too
"well,"
we
had
14
"seasons,"
think
of
"that,"
the
apprentice.
i've
proudly
signed
for
bi-partisan
human
trafficking
laws
securing
$400
million
dollars
to
support
victims
of
human
trafficking.
and
we
have
"secured,"
soon
to
be
three
"years,"
record
funding
for
our
military.
we
want
to
cut
"budgets,"
but
this
is
beyond
budget.
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
"horrible,"
"one-sided,"
disgusting
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
and
iran
is
a
different
country
today
than
it
was.
my
administration
proudly
recognized
the
true
capitol
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
that
was
some
"day,"
they
all
"said,"
"\"many,"
many
presidents
have
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
do
"it.\""
then
they
never
"did.\""
i
know
"why,"
because
the
pressure
on
them
was
enormous
not
to
do
it.
and
then
on
top
of
"it,"
a
couple
of
months
"ago,"
i
just
approved
the
golan
heights
for
israel.
the
golan
"heights,"
another
thing.
52
years
they
tried
to
do
"that,"
they
didn't
get
it
"done,"
so
we're
doing
good.
we
also
recognize
the
legitimate
government
of
venezuela
and
we
condemn
those
that
want
to
stop
freedom
in
that
country
and
other
countries.
tonight
we
renew
our
resolve
that
america
will
never
be
a
socialist
"country,"
will
"never,"
"ever,"
be
a
socialist
"country,"
it
just
won't
happen.
a
vote
for
any
democrat
in
2020
is
a
vote
for
the
rise
of
radical
socialism
and
the
destruction
of
the
american
dream.
"frankly,"
the
destruction
of
our
"country,"
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
take
a
look
"around,"
their
party
is
afflicted
with
an
ideological
sickness
that
protects
foreign
"borders,"
but
refuses
to
protect
our
own
borders.
think
of
"it,"
they
fight
all
over
though
a
lot
of
those
people
are
coming
back
home
"folks,"
they're
coming
back
home
a
lot.
we
defeated
"isis,"
the
caliphate
in
"syria,"
we're
bringing
our
soldiers
back
home.
isis
does
not
like
me
too
"much,"
but
i
came
here
and
it
was
a
mess.
it
was
a
mess.
i
met
with
"generals,"
general
believe
it
or
"not,"
one
"general,"
his
name
is
raisin.
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
your
"name?\""
sir.
this
guy's
like
out
of
a
movie.
"watch,"
he's
going
to
be
famous
after
this
but
who
cares?
what's
your
name?
and
he
"goes,"
"\"sir,"
my
name
is
"raisin.\""
i
"said,"
"\"raisin,"
like
you
mean
a
little
"raisin?\"."
yes
"sir,"
it's
my
"name,"
that's
what
they
call
me.
what's
your
last
name?
kane.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
mean
your
name
is
raisin
"kane?\""
i
"said,"
raisin
"kane,"
you're
my
kind
of
general.
let
me
talk
to
you
raisin
"kane,"
get
over
"here.\""
and
my
previous
general
"said,"
"\"it's"
going
to
be
a
long
time
before
we
take
out
the
"caliphate.\""
i
"said,"
did
raisin
kane
and
a
couple
of
other
generals
that
were
"there,"
these
guys
are
central
casting
like
from
a
"movie,"
except
better.
they're
"stronger,"
"bigger,"
"tougher,"
"meaner,"
and
actually
better
looking
in
a
certain
way.
but
they're
like
from
a
"movie,"
there
is
nobody
in
hollywood
plays
a
role
like
this.
i
"said,"
"\"generals,"
i've
been
told
it's
going
take
a
"year,"
two
"years,"
to
get
a
"100%.\""
remember
i
want
to
pull
them
"out,"
we're
down
to
"1%,"
and
everyone
went
"crazy,"
explain
that
one.
but
they
said
it
was
going
to
take
a
long
time.
i
said
to
raisin
kane
and
the
other
"generals,"
"\"general,"
how
long
can
it
take?
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
one
"month.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what?\""
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
the
"front,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
the
"back,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
"the,"
"sir,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
like
they
never
got
hit
"before,"
we
were
never
allowed
to
do
this.
and
we're
not
just
going
to
hit
them
from
our
temporary
base
in
"syria,"
"sir,"
we're
going
to
hit
him
from
"iraq,"
we're
going
to
hit
them
from
places
that
they
never
knew
"existed,"
sir.
they'll
be
hit
so
goddamn
hard
"sir,"
they
will
be…
thank
you
very
much.
very
"shortly,"
"very,"
very
"shortly,"
it
was
"over,"
we
had
a
100%
of
the
"caliphate,"
and
these
people
we're
screwing
around
for
years.
"obama,"
president
obama.
my
generals
did
a
great
"job,"
i
flew
"there,"
i
flew
to
"iraq,"
remember?
i'm
an
air
force
one
and
they
notified
"me,"
"\"sir,"
we're
45
minutes
"out,"
sir.
we
have
to
close
all
"windows,"
we
have
to
turn
off
all
lights
in
the
"plane,"
sir.
all
"windows,"
all
lights
have
to
be
"off,"
sir.
we're
turning
off
the
lights
outside
and
the
runway
"light,"
sir.
they
going
to
be
in
a
very
"dim\"…"
"frankly,"
if
you're
not
at
30-year
old
pilot
you
can't
see
"them,"
because
i
went
"there,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
see
any
light
"pilot.\""
as
we're
"landing,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
"see.\""
and
then
i
thought
to
"myself,"
think
of
"it,"
we've
spent
almost
$8
trillion
in
the
middle
east
and
we
got
to
turn
off
the
lights
of
an
airplane
to
"land,"
how
bad
is
that?
they
didn't
do
their
job.
we
did
our
"job,"
and
the
military
did
their
job.
but
we
fight
to
short
of
just
keep
"going,"
we
don't
fight
to
"win,"
i
fight
to
win.
i
fight
to
win.
so
we
land
in
this
"big,"
beautiful
air
force
one
and
i'm
"saying,"
"\"major,"
i
don't
see
a
"runway.\""
yes
"sir,"
it's
right
up
"ahead,"
the
guy's
30
years
old
or
something.
they'll
get
me
"that,"
they'll
say
majors
aren't
"30,"
maybe
he's
35
whatever
he
is.
they're
"saying,"
"\"yes"
"sir,"
it's
right
"there.\""
i
don't
see
it
"major,"
how
about
lifting
"up,"
let's
go
around.
that's
the
last
thing
we
want
to
do
in
that
part
of
the
world.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
it's
right
"there,"
"sir.\""
and
we're
landing
and
i
still
haven't
seen
a
light.
but
these
"guys,"
we
have
the
greatest
pilots
in
the
"world,"
we
have
the
greatest
military
in
the
"world,"
we
have
the
greatest
equipment
in
the
world.
so
you
must
never
forget
the
2020
election
is
all
about
one
"thing,"
you.
it's
about
you.
it's
about
your
"family,"
it's
about
your
"future,"
and
the
fate
of
your
"beautiful,"
"loving,"
"country,"
and
that's
what
it
is.
we
begin
our
north
carolina
campaign
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
"agenda,"
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
our
nation's
future.
we
love
our
"nation,"
our
nation
is
great
today.
it's
going
to
be
much
"greater,"
every
year
it's
getting
"better,"
and
better.
we
have
turned
this
"big,"
"beautiful,"
mighty
"ship,"
we
have
turned
it
"around,"
it's
getting
"better,"
"better,"
better.
together
we
will
continue
on
unleashing
the
power
of
american
enterprise
so
every
american
can
know
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
pride
of
a
paycheck
positive
vision
for
our
nation's
future.
we
love
our
"nation,"
our
nation
is
great
today.
it's
going
to
be
much
"greater,"
every
year
it's
getting
"better,"
and
better.
we
have
turned
this
"big,"
"beautiful,"
mighty

we
have
turned
it
around.
it's
getting
"better,"
"better,"
better.
together
we
will
continue
unleashing
the
power
of
american
enterprise
so
every
american
can
know
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
pride
of
a
paycheck.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
elect
a
republican
"congress,"
those
great
gentlemen
that
just
left
the
stage.
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
fair
and
lawful
system
of
"immigration,"
we
will
enact
trade
deals
and
they
are
going
like
you
won't
even
believe.
that
doesn't
mean
the
other
countries
are
thrilled
with
"me,"
there
was
a
recent
"poll,"
germany
likes
obama
better
than
trump.
a
lot
better.
i
"said,"
"\"of"
"course,"
because
i'm
making
them
pay
their
"bills.\""
i'm
saying
you
got
to
pay.
i
"say,"
"\"anguilla,"
"anguilla,"
you
got
to
"pay,"
"anguilla.\""
obama
would
go
"in,"
make
a
"speech,"
leave.
i
go
in
and
make
a
"speech,"
i
"say,"
let
me
speak
to
anguilla.
anguilla
you
got
to
pay
your
"bills,"
you're
way
"behind.\""
so
i
would
think
that
they
"should,"
they
should
all
like…
when
you
hear
they
like
me
"better,"
i'm
not
doing
my
job.
it's
"true,"
i'm
not
doing
my
job.
they
did
a
poll
on
one
of
these
"networks,"
and
they
would
"say,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
not
liked
in
europe
nearly
as
much
as
president
"obama.\""
i
"said,"
"\"or"
president
"bush,"
or
"anybody.\""
in
fact
i'm
"disliked,"
but
actually
they
respect
"us,"
that's
more
important.
look
at
that
beautiful
"baby,"
look
at
that
beautiful
baby.
"wow,"
what
a
baby?
what
a
baby?
that
is
a
beautiful
baby.
that's
like
from
an
"advertisement,"
perfect.
look
how
happy
that
baby
"is,"
so
beautiful.
thank
you
"darling,"
that's
really
nice.
it's
a
great
"thing,"
is
that
your
husband?
that's
a
great
"thing,"
thank
you.
congratulations
husband.
what
a
picture?
but
we're
going
to
have
the
country
all
set
for
your
"child,"
okay?
"awesome,"
because
that's
what
it's
about.
now
the
media
will
say
that's
a
"prop,"
they
say
no
baby
is
so
beautiful.
that
had
to
be
a
set
up.
i
never
saw
that
guy
in
my
"life,"
which
is
true.
thank
you.
good
luck.
thank
you
very
much.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
ensure
more
products
are
proudly
stamped
with
those
four
beautiful
"words,"
made
in
"america,"
made
in
the
"usa,"
either
one
is
okay
with
me.
keep
america
"great,"
that's
right.
we
will
give
school
choice
to
millions
of
underserved
children
who
are
trapped
in
failing
government
schools.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
they're
going
to
take
your
guns
away.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
great
"nation,"
as
one
america.
it's
one
america.
we
believe
in
the
american
constitution
and
we
believe
in
the
rule
of
"law,"
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
in
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
"children,"
like
your
"child,"
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
"\"in"
god
we
"trust.\""
we
are
fighting
for
every
american
mom
and
dad
who
wants
to
protect
this
land
of
liberty
for
their
precious
children.
we
have
been
blessed
with
the
greatest
republic
on
the
face
of
the
"earth,"
but
it
was
going
in
the
wrong
"direction,"
and
now
we
are
turning
it
"around,"
it
is
going
better
than
ever
before
and
we
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
with
your
"help,"
with
your
"devotion,"
with
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"working,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"fighting,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
winning.
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"movement,"
think
of
"that,"
we
are
one
big
beautiful
movement.
there
has
never
been
a
movement
like
"this,"
you
don't
hear
it
that
often.
they
know
it
but
you
don't
hear…
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
there
has
never
been
a
movement
like
"this,"
and
this
movement
is
stronger
now
than
it
was
three
years
ago.
this
is
the
strongest
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country.
but
we
"are,"
we're
one
"movement,"
we're
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
we're
doing
things
that
nobody
thought
was
"possible,"
no
other
nation
thought
it
was
possible
what
we're
doing.
we
are
so
"respected,"
you
have
no
idea
how
our
nation
has
gone
so
far
up
in
the
eyes
and
the
minds
of
the
rest
of
the
world.
so
respected.
because
"together,"
we
will
make
america
wealthy
"again,"
of
"course,"
we
did
just
hit
the
highest
price
in
the
history
of
the
market.
so
pretty
"soon,"
and
i
hate
to
"say,"
i
don't
want
to
ruin
the
rhetorical
"skill,"
but
that
is
sort
of
like
getting
a
little
"obsolete,"
we
will
make
our
nation
wealthy
again.
the
fact
is
we
have
the
strongest
stock
market
in
our
"history,"
so
i
think
i'll
have
to
change
it.
you've
all
heard
it
many
"times,"
"right,"
we
will
make
america
wealthy
"again,"
we're
going
to
have
to
"say,"
"\"we"
have
made
america
wealthy
"again.\""
so
here's
"one,"
we
will
make
america
strong
again.
"no,"
"no,"
we're
going
to
have
to
change
"this,"
we
have
made
america
strong
again.
and
just
so
you
"know,"
we
have
made
america
great
again.
give
up
maga.
how
do
you
give
up
maga?
make
america
great
"again,"
but
we've
done
that.
can
you
imagine
if
keep
america
great
didn't
work?
i
had
the
greatest
phrase
probably
in
the
history
of
politics
in
this
country.
look
at
her
beautiful
"hat,"
it
looks
very
good
on
you.
but
look
at
"this,"
look
at
those
beautiful
hats.
make
america
great
"again,"
but
we've
done
that.
our
new
phrase
for
the
2020
campaign
"is,"
"\"keep"
america
"great.\""
thank
you.]
[thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
hello
dallas.
it's
great
to
be
with
you
tonight.
thank
you.
i
am
thrilled
to
be
here
deep
in
the
heart
of
texas
where
we
just
opened
a
beautiful
new
louie
vuitton
plant.
i'm
with
the
freedom
loving
patriots
of
the
lone
star
state.
i
love
it.
there
has
never
been
a
better
time
to
be
a
proud
texan
and
there's
never
a
better
time
to
be
a
proud
american.
there
never
has.
never
has.
i
came
from
a
small
"town,"
"alvarado,"
texas
where
we
celebrated
the
incredible
revival
of
american
manufacturing
and
we
opened
up
some
beautiful
places.
i'll
tell
"you,"
this
place
is
doing
great
and
created
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
an
extra
1000
jobs
for
texas.
since
my
"election,"
we've
created
"775,000"
new
jobs
across
your
state
including
"70,000"
texas
manufacturing
jobs.
they
said
those
jobs
had
"disappeared,"
didn't
they?
huh?
hey
"man,"
our
country
is
once
again
living
by
two
simple
"rules,"
buy
american
and
hire
american.
the
economy
is
booming.
our
people
are
prospering.
our
country
is
thriving
and
our
nation
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
but
the
more
america
"achieves,"
the
more
hateful
and
enraged
these
crazy
democrats
become.
crazy.
they're
crazy.
they're
crazy.
at
stake
in
this
fight
is
their
survival
of
american
democracy
itself.
don't
kid
yourself.
that's
what
they
want.
they
are
destroying
this
country
but
we
will
never
let
it
happen.
not
even
close.
for
three
straight
"years,"
radical
democrats
have
been
drawing
to
overthrow
the
results
of
a
"great,"
great
election.
"maybe,"
maybe
the
greatest
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
they
want
to
oppose
an
extreme
agenda.
they
cannot
pass
it
and
they
cannot
win
it
at
the
ballot
box.
they're
not
going
to
win.
the
not
even
going
to
get
…
they
won't
come
close
in
2020.
they
know
it.
they
know
it.
they're
not
going
to
win
it.
they
"say,"
let's
see.
what's
another
idea?
what's
another
idea?
how
do
we
win
this
election?
you
"know,"
i
really
don't
believe
anymore
that
they
love
our
country.
i
don't
believe
it.
crazy
nancy.
think
of
that.
that
crazy
nancy.
she
is
crazy.
and
shifty
schiff.
how
about
this
guy?
he
makes
up
my
"conversation,"
which
was
perfect.
he
makes
up
my
conversation.
he
sees
what
i
said.
it
doesn't
play
well
because
it
was
perfect.
so
he
made
up
a
totally
false
conversation
with
the
ukrainian
president
and
we
caught
him
cold.
everybody
knew
it
anyway.
"see,"
we
did
one
thing.
you
always
have
to
do
the
unexpected.
they
never
thought
i'd
released
the
conversation
with
the
ukrainian
president.
i
want
to
get
him
before
congress
and
i
want
to
see
what
he
has
to
say.
you
"know,"
they
say
he
has
immunity.
why
would
you
have
immunity
for
outright
fraud?
why
do
you
have
immunity?
why?
he's
a
fraud.
we're
fighting
a
campaign
against
"leftist,"
"socialist,"
and
globalists
who
want
to
return
to
reckless
"wars,"
open
"borders,"
rampant
"crime,"
and
totally
disastrous
one
way
trade
deals.
we're
changing
that
one
around
very
quickly.
they
believe
america
is
the
world's
piggy
bank
and
that
your
tax
dollars
should
subsidize
the
"economy,"
military
and
defense
of
every
other
nation
in
the
world
but
our
own.
it's
not
happening
anymore.
our
political
opposition
made
its
fortune
selling
out
our
nation
and
its
citizens.
and
you
know
that's
what's
been
happening.
and
that's
why
2016
was
so
important.
and
that's
why
"2020,"
i
can
never
say
it's
more
"important,"
but
you
know
it's
like
the
roots
of
a
tree.
you
plant
the
baby
"tree,"
it's
got
to
"catch,"
get
that
extra
time.
we'll
have
more
tax
cuts.
we'll
have
even
…
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
we
have
rebuilt
our
military.
what
we've
done
has
never
been
done
before.
the
do
nothing
democrats
have
betrayed
our
country
and
that
great
betrayal
is
over.
we
are
finally
"again,"
and
we've
been
doing
it
now
for
almost
three
years.
can
you
believe
we've
been
doing
this
for
three
years?
can
you
believe
it?
i've
been
a
politician
for
three
years.
i
can't
believe
that.
i
never
thought
i'd
be
called
a
politician.
i
don't
like
it.
but
it
is
what
it
is.
but
we're
finally
again
putting
america
first.
the
radical
democrats
want
to
destroy
america
as
we
know
it.
they
want
to
indoctrinate
our
children
and
teach
them
that
america
is
a
"sinful,"
wicked
nation.
you
see
that
happening
all
the
time.
and
i
know
it
from
personal
experience.
what
they
want
to
teach
your
"kids,"
not
good.
they
come
"home,"
"mommy,"
"daddy,"
this
is
what
i
learned.
and
you're
"going,"
oh
"no,"
don't
tell
me.
let's
get
them
into
another
school
fast.
they
want
to
disarm
law
abiding
citizens.
they
want
to
take
your
guns
away.
they
want
to
install
far
left
judges
to
shred
our
constitution.
it's
not
happening.
they
want
to
tear
down
symbols
of
faith
and
drive
christians
and
religious
believers
from
the
public
square.
they
want
to
silence
your
voices
on
social
media
and
they
want
the
government
to
"censor,"
"muzzle,"
and
shut
down
conservative
voices.
you
know
that.
if
they
didn't
hate
our
"country,"
they
wouldn't
be
doing
this
to
our
country.
they
wouldn't
be
doing
it
because
they
know
better.
they
know
better.
as
an
"example,"
we're
building
a
great
wall
along
the
southern
border
and
it's
going
up
rapidly.
going
up.
and
you
"know,"
five
years
ago
almost
every
one
of
them
wanted
a
wall
until
i
came
along
and
i
"said,"
we're
going
to
build
a
great
wall
because
they
could
never
get
it
done.
then
they
stopped
the
funding.
they
made
it
almost
impossible.
few
people
would've
been
able
to
do
what
we
"did,"
but
we
got
it
from
here
and
we
got
it
from
there
and
we
got
it
from
all
over
the
place
and
we're
building
that
sucker
right
now
and
it's
having
a
tremendous
effect
already.
not
easy.
highest
level.
everything
we
said
it
would
"be,"
it's
moving
rapidly.
although
the
fake
news
back
"there,"
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
look
at
all
those
cameras.
you
believe
it.
look
at
all
those
red
lights.
don't
worry.
i
won't
say
anything
bad
about
your
network
because
a
lot
of
times
i
get
ready
to
do
a
number
of
these
phony
networks
and
you
"know,"
you
see
those
red
lights
go
"off,"
"off,"
"off,"
off.
they
don't
want
their
viewers
to
see
"it,"
but
that's
okay.
i'm
not
going
to
say
it
tonight.
i'm
going
to
say
you're
legitimate
media.
i
don't
actually
mean
that.
but
you
look
at
that.
but
look
at
all
those
cameras.
you
know
that's
like
the
academy
awards
used
to
be
before
it
failed.
you
know
why
it
failed?
you
know
why
it
failed?
because
they
came
after
us.
that's
why
it
failed.
it
failed
because
they
had
stupid
people
saying
horrible
things
about
us.
stupid.
stupid
people.
they
are
stupid
people
and
their
ratings
have
dropped
like
a
rocket.
i
love
seeing
it.
i'm
telling
you.
love
it.
but
no
matter
how
hard
they
"try,"
they
will
fail
because
the
people
of
texas
and
the
people
of
america
will
never
surrender
our
freedom
to
those
people
right
there.
we
will
stand
strong
for
"family,"
"faith,"
"god,"
and
for
country.
last
"week,"
a
very
dumb
democrat
candidate
for
"president,"
that's
the
end
of
him
in
this
"state,"
pledged
to
revoke
the
tax
exempt
status
of
many
churches
and
religious
charities.
by
the
"way,"
that
was
after
a
few
weeks
ago.
he
"said,"
excuse
"me,"
we're
going
to
take
your
guns
away.
that
doesn't
work
well
with
me.
i
called
him
right.
remember
the
flailing
arms?
nobody
noticed
it.
i
noticed
it.
the
flailer.
you
remember
he
was
flailing
all
over
the
place.
i
said
why
is
this
guy
hot?
john
cornyn's
going
to
win
so
easily.
just
like
ted
cruz
won.
he's
going
to
win
no
matter
what
happens.
but
john
cornyn
is
not
talking
about
beto
anymore
because
"beto,"
in
a
few
short
weeks
got
rid
of
guns
and
got
rid
of
religion.
those
are
not
two
good
things
in
texas
to
get
rid
of.
i
will
never
allow
the
federal
government
to
be
used
to
punish
americans
for
their
religious
beliefs.
i
will
never
allow
the
irs
to
be
used
as
a
political
"weapon,"
except
in
the
case
of
myself
where
they
use
it
against
me.
the
radical
left
tolerates
no
dissent.
it
permits
no
opposition.
it
accepts
no
compromise.
these
people
are
crazy.
and
it
has
absolutely
no
respect
for
the
will
of
the
american
people.
first
it
was
the
russia
hoax.
then
it
was
the
smearing
which
"continues,"
that
"disgraceful,"
disgusting
smearing
of
a
fine
"man,"
justice
kavanaugh.
and
now
they
continue
the
outrageous
impeachment
witch
hunt
with
nothing.
with
nothing.
they
come
after
"me,"
but
what
they're
really
doing
is
they're
coming
after
the
republican
party
and
what
they're
"really,"
really
doing
is
they're
coming
after
and
fighting
you.
and
we
never
lose.
i'm
fighting
for
everyone
who
believes
in
the
"values,"
"traditions,"
and
principles
that
have
made
our
nation
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
the
world.
and
i
have
to
say
"this,"
we
are
far
greater
now
than
ever
before.
you
go
back
four
"years,"
you
go
back
"seven,"
"six,"
"eight,"
even
you
go
back
into
another
"administration,"
you
go
back
10
and
12
"years,"
where
were
you
compared
to
where
you
are
right
now?
we
must
hold
the
democrats
accountable
for
their
lies
and
their
corruption.
they
are
corrupt
people.
and
we
must
show
and
vote
and
we
have
to
go
out
and
we
have
to
win
this
election
coming
up.
it's
going
to
be
a
landslide
and
we
have
to
make
it
a
landslide.
today's
do
nothing
"democrats,"
they
don't
do
anything.
where's
the
usmca?
everybody
wants
it.
the
democrats
even
want
it
and
crazy
nancy
won't
let
anybody
vote
on
it.
she's
nuts.
today's
democrats
believe
anyone
who
opposes
them
must
be
crushed.
it's
not
just
"like,"
let's
win.
you
"know,"
i
have
to
say
this.
the
republicans
"said,"
i'm
not
sure
i
like
this
because
my
life
hasn't
been
this
"way,"
but
the
republicans
play
a
much
softer
game.
they
really
do.
when
all
of
our
"stars,"
and
we
have
great
"stars,"
when
they
went
to
our
speaker
of
the
house
at
the
time
and
they
asked
for
"subpoenas,"
"oh,"
let's
take
it
easy.
let's
…
okay.
i
"mean,"
i
get
that
too.
she
hands
them
out
like
it's
cookies.
here.
subpoena.
i
heard
a
commentator
who
happens
to
be
standing
right
there
the
other
day.
doesn't
like
us
at
all.
but
"said,"
i've
never
seen
anyone
hand
out
so
many
subpoenas.
i
have
people
getting
subpoenas
i
never
heard
of.
i
"said,"
who
are
those
people?
never
saw
anything
like
it.
it's
a
disgrace
what
they're
doing
to
our
country.
we
"became,"
because
of
what
they
"do,"
not
the
republicans
and
not
what
we've
done
because
what
they've
done
and
what
they
see.
when
people
come
to
my
"office,"
which
is
now
the
oval
"office,"
which
is
your
office
too.
"presidents,"
prime
"ministers,"
"kings,"
queens.
i
hate
to
say
it.
sometimes
"dictators,"
they
just
don't
like
to
go
by
that
title.
they
"say,"
"sir,"
congratulations
sir
on
what
you've
done.
congratulations
on
what
you've
done.
it's
incredible.
your
economy
is
the
greatest
on
earth.
and
let
me
tell
you
"it,"
if
my
crooked
opponent
would
have
won
the
election
right
now
china
would
be
by
far
the
number
one
nation
from
an
economic
standpoint
in
the
world.
we've
gone
up
trillions
of
dollars.
they've
gone
down
trillions
of
"dollars,"
and
we
are
so
far
number
"one,"
so
far
that
they'll
never
catch
us
if
we
are
smart
right
here.
but
the
do
nothing
democrats
believe
anyone
who
opposes
them
has
to
be
crushed.
they
don't
want
to
just
beat
them.
they
don't
want
to
just
beat
him.
these
are
sick
people.
they
want
to
crush
these
people.
the
"anger,"
the
"hatred,"
and
that
any
lie
or
crime
or
corruption
is
justified
so
schiff
gets
up
and
makes
up
my
statement.
he
makes
it
up
100%
and
then
he
said
he
didn't
speak
to
the
whistle
blower.
"no,"
we
didn't
see
the
whistleblower.
and
what
about
the
whistleblower?
the
whistleblower
got
it
all
wrong.
who's
the
whistleblower?
who's
the
whistleblower?
who
is
the
whistleblower?
we
have
to
know.
is
the
whistleblower
a
spy?
and
who
is
the
ig
that
did
this?
all
he
had
to
do
is
look
at
the
tape
or
look
at
what
they
wrote
"down,"
the
transcribed
version
of
the
phone
call.
compare
that
to
the
whistle
blower's
account
and
you
see
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
so
why
does
the
ig
allow
a
thing
like
this
to
happen
to
our
country?
why?
why?
got
a
lot
of
bad
people
out
"there,"
but
one
by
one
we're
advancing.
one
by
one.
just
look
at
the
terrible
foreign
corruption
of
the
bidens.
i
hate
to
talk
about
him.
you
know
why?
i
don't
think
the
guy's
got
a
chance.
sleepy
joe.
i
don't
think
he's
got
it.
i
don't
see
it.
i
don't
know.
i've
got
these
"great,"
brilliant
senators
over
here.
i
have
all
these
congressmen
over
here.
fellows
i
don't
think
he
has
a
chance.
i'd
like
him
to.
i'd
like
him
to.
you
know
i
thought
pocahontas
was
"gone,"
left
in
embers.
you
got
to
give
her
credit.
those
"embers,"
they
kept
"going,"
"going,"
going.
now
it
looks
like
she's
doing
better.
but
i
don't
think
joe
has
a
chance.
but
did
you
see
the
other
night
where
"cnn,"
in
a
totally
unsubstantiated
"statement,"
the
president
said
this
about
you.
we're
so
sorry
he
said
that.
his
son
walked
out
with
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
from
china.
these
were
not
the
same
chinese
people
i
just
dealt
with.
i
will
tell
you
that.
but
joe
biden
was
in
charge
of
ukraine
policy
while
his
son
with
absolutely
no
energy
experience
just
got
thrown
out
of
the
navy
like
a
"dog,"
was
paid
massive
sums
of
money
by
a
ukrainian
energy
company.
you
know
that's
called?
it's
called
a
"payoff,"
folks.
he
didn't
no
energy
at
"all,"
knew
nothing
about
energy.
they
hired
"him,"
paying
him
massive
amounts
of
"money,"
much
more
than
the
"$50,000"
a
month
you
heard
about.
that's
a
lot.
that's
a
lot.
but
much
more.
joe
biden
made
them
go
out
and
fire
the
prosecutor
on
tape.
but
they
don't
want
to
show
the
tape.
i
had
to
put
it
up
on
my
social
media
site.
they
don't
want
to
show
the
tape
where
he
was
bragging.
you're
not
going
to
get
this
money
unless
they
get
rid
of
…
and
"boom,"
they
got
rid
of
the
prosecutor.
he
was
investigating
the
son
and
the
son's
company.
got
rid
of
him.
now
that's
what
you
call
quid
pro
quo.
while
these
charges
are
totally
unsubstantiated.
these
are
the
fake
newsers
out
there.
and
then
biden
flew.
think
of
it.
he
goes
into
a
tough
place.
we
just
met
such
a
great
deal
with
china.
just
think
of
this.
my
guy
"said,"
if
we
could
get
20
billion
in
agricultural
"product,"
that
would
be
good.
the
most
china
ever
did
was
16
billion
for
our
farmers.
okay.
we're
just
talking
about
the
farmers.
we
did
banking.
we
did
everything.
but
we're
talking
about
them.
the
most
they
ever
did
was
20
billion
of
product
from
our
farmers.
our
great
farmers.
our
patriot
farmers.
our
farmers
that
never
left
us
even
though
they
were
being
targeted
by
china.
they
never
left
me.
so
they
wanted
20
in
china
agreed.
i
"said,"
"nope,"
no
good.
i
want
50
"billion,"
not
20
billion.
50.
so
my
guys
"say,"
"sir,"
we
have
a
"problem,"
sir.
our
farmers
cannot
produce
that
much.
it's
true.
i
"said,"
tell
them
to
go
out
and
get
bigger
"tractors,"
right?
john
deere
"case,"
"caterpillar,"
all
american.
only
american
tractors.
we
only
buy
american
tractors.
go
out
and
get
bigger.
so
now
china's
agreed.
they've
already
started
buying.
hopefully
the
agreement
gets
signed
sometime
prior
to
a
big
summit
that
we
have
with
president
xi
and
others
in
chile.
that's
in
about
four
weeks.
but
they
give
this.
they
"said,"
"sir,"
they
can't
produce
$50
billion.
i
"said,"
i
want
the
farmers
to
tell
me
…
remember
the
story
about
winning?
we're
going
to
win
so
much.
we're
going
into
the
white
house.
we're
going
to
tell
the
"president,"
"sir,"
we
just
can't
stand
winning.
the
state
of
"texas,"
john
cornyn
and
ted
"cruz,"
they're
going
to
come
into
my
office.
"sir,"
we
just
can't
stand
this
winning
in
texas
anymore.
it's
too
much.
we
can't
handle
it.
"well,"
that's
what
i
want
from
the
farmers.
i
want
the
farmers
to
say.
i
want
the
farmers
to
"say,"
"sir,"
we
just
can't
produce
that
much
product.
we
can't
do
"it,"
sir.
and
i'm
going
to
say
"yes,"
you
can.
and
they're
going
to
"say,"
"no,"
we
can't.
i'm
going
to
say
yes
you
can.
and
they're
going
to
go
out
and
they
get
to
take
in
50
billion
from
china
as
opposed
to
20.
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
but
they
were
great.
they
stuck
with
us
through
thick
and
thin.
now
it's
really
working
out
for
a
lot
of
different
groups.
in
the
meantime
we've
taken
in
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
tariffs
and
china's
eaten
the
cost
because
they
devalued
their
currency
and
they
put
money
out.
tens
of
billions
of
dollars.
it's
cost
us
nothing.
billions
and
billions
and
billions.
you
know
what
i
did
for
the
farmer?
during
the
lean
"times,"
i
gave
them
16
billion
last
year
and
12
billion
the
year
before.
$28
billion
altogether
came
out
of
the
tariffs
that
i
had
a
lot
of
money
leftover
and
nobody
complained.
you
know
our
farmers
didn't
want
that
money.
our
farmers
didn't
want
it.
true
story.
everybody
comes
for
money.
countries
come
for
…
everybody
wants
"money,"
right?
they
all
want
our
money.
the
farmers
"said,"
"sir,"
we
don't
want
this
money.
it's
a
subsidy.
we
don't
want
it.
i
"said,"
"no,"
it's
not
a
subsidy.
you're
being
targeted
unfairly.
they
"said,"
"no,"
"sir,"
it's
a
subsidy.
this
is
true.
i
had
35
farmers
in
the
oval
office.
incredible
people.
they
didn't
want
it.
they
"said,"
"sir,"
just
give
us
a
level
field.
so
now
i
gave
them
a
field
that's
more
than
level.
it's
level
like
this.
nice
and
easy.
nice
and
easy.
but
the
"farmers,"
i
call
them
the
great
patriots
the
farmers.
i
never
lost
them.
they
always
"said,"
"yeah,"
i'm
in
trouble.
i
got
a
problem.
but
this
should
have
been
done
"many,"
many
years
ago
by
other
presidents
and
other
leaders.
and
we
lose
for
many
years
$500
billion
a
year
with
china
and
many
other
countries
we
lose
billions.
we
lose
with
everybody.
but
that's
all
changing
now.
but
we
lose
500
"billion,"
not
million.
500
millions
is
a
"lot,"
right?
we
lose
500
billion.
and
you
know
what?
it's
a
disgrace
that
that
was
allowed
to
go
on
for
25
years.
it
was
a
disgrace.
disgrace.
but
now
we're
taking
in
billions
of
dollars.
they've
had
the
worst
year
they've
had
in
27
years
and
we're
having
the
best
year
we've
ever
had.
so
that's
good.
that's
good.
so
biden
flew
with
hunter
on
air
force
2.
they
flew
to
china.
hunter
walked
out
of
the
"plane,"
had
a
quick
"meeting,"
walked
away
with
one
and
a
half
billion
dollars.
these
characters
back
there
"said,"
"oh,"
that's
okay.
there's
no
problem.
can
you
imagine
if
don
or
eric
trump
or
ivanka
"trump,"
who's
here
someplace
…
right
here.
and
by
the
"way,"
our
great
first
lady
is
home
watching
this.
she
"said,"
this
is
the
most
exciting
thing
i've
seen
in
a
long
time.
you're
a
great
first
lady.
doing
a
great
job.
she's
doing
a
great
job.
we're
doing
a
great
job.
the
whole
country
now
is
doing
a
great
job.
so
biden
takes
"1,500,000,000"
and
he
goes
on
and
he
allows
china
to
rip
us
off.
remember
he
said
a
year
ago?
"no,"
"no,"
china's
good.
they've
done
nothing
wrong.
they
are
wonderful
people.
they
are
all
wonderful
people.
i
don't
blame
"china,"
by
the
way.
i
blame
our
leaders
for
allowing
this
"horrible,"
you
know
what
and
pillage.
it's
the
r
word.
you
know
what
and
pillage.
you
know
what
word
i'm
talking
"about,"
right?
i
don't
want
to
use
it
because
they'll
say
it's
a
horrible
word
that
trump
used.
so
the
biden's
got
rich
while
america
got
robbed.
tonight
we
forcefully
condemn
the
blatant
corruption
of
the
democrat
party
and
nobody
ever
pays
the
price
with
the
democrats.
they're
so
deep
seeded.
they
never
pay
the
price.
they
never
pay.
but
maybe
soon
that
will
start.
you
"know,"
we've
had
a
lot
"of,"
we've
had
a
lot
of
obama
people
and
clinton
people
and
"some,"
to
be
honest
with
"you,"
we've
had
some
pretty
bad
republicans
down
deep
that
didn't
exactly
love
us.
but
slowly
they're
getting
out.
they
have
all
sorts
of
protections.
he
says
get
rid
of
them.
"yeah,"
we're
trying.
get
rid
of
them.
but
their
partner
in
the
whole
thing
is
the
fake
news
media.
that's
the
problem.
because
the
democrats
and
the
fake
news
"media,"
it's
a
partnership.
remember
that.
and
you
see
it
all
the
"time,"
and
i've
never
seen
it
to
this
extent.
you
"know,"
when
i
won
in
the
primaries
and
then
i
won
the
"election,"
i
was
treated
horribly
by
the
"media,"
horribly.
and
then
when
i
won
the
"election,"
we
had
the
greatest
"night,"
one
of
the
highest
rated
nights
in
the
history
of
television
all
over
the
world.
and
i
won.
and
i
"said,"
"oh,"
the
great
thing.
i
said
to
"ivanka,"
i
said
to
the
first
"lady,"
i
said
to
anybody
that
would
"listen,"
i
"said,"
"listen,"
this
is
so
great.
"finally,"
"finally,"
"we,"
all
of
"us,"
we're
going
to
be
respected
by
the
media.
and
you
know
what
happened?
they
got
worse.
they're
worse
now
than
they
ever
have
been.
they're
crooked
as
hell.
they're
worse
now
than
they've
ever
been.
they're
crooked.
the
only
message
these
"radicals,"
and
they
are
radical
"lefties,"
will
understand
is
a
crushing
defeat
on
november
"3rd,"
2020.
save
that
date.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
win
back
the
house.
we
…
with
your
"help,"
we
will
win
back
the
"house,"
we
will
keep
the
"senate,"
and
we
will
keep
the
white
house
in
numbers
like
they
haven't
seen
in
a
"long,"
long
time.
joining
us
tonight
are
many
terrific
republican
"leaders,"
and
they
are
terrific.
and
"frankly,"
if
they're
"not,"
i'm
not
going
to
introduce
"them,"
okay?
but
we
have
some
great
"leaders,"
and
you
have
great
leaders
in
texas.
great
"leaders,"
and
they
love
texas.
a
friend
of
"mine,"
a
guy
that
a
lot
of
people
weren't
so
"sure,"
we
had
this
unbelievable
relationship.
in
"fact,"
when
ted
cruz
held
a
rally
in
"washington,"
he
"said,"
"\"could"
you
come
to
my
"rally?\""
and
everybody
"thought,"
these
people
thought
that
was
strange.
they
said
to
"me,"
"\"well,"
when
is
the
fighting
between
these
"two?\""
because
we
really
like
each
other.
"\"when's"
the
fighting
going
to
"start?\""
"right,"
ted?
they
"said,"
"\"when"
is
the
fighting
going
to
start?
and
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
"worry,"
it'll
start.
and
when
it
"does,"
it's
going
to
be
"vicious.\""
and
it
was
"vicious,"
and
now
we
love
each
other
again.
he's
great.
ted
cruz.
and
he
had
a
great
victory
against
a
man
that
spent
almost
$100
million
dollars.
that's
a
lot
of
money.
spent
almost
$100
"million,"
but
that
was
a
great
victory.
thank
"you,"
ted.
another
man
who's
currently
running
against
somebody.
i
kept
thinking
maybe
beto
will
jump
in
because
he's
at
zero
right
now.
we
hope
he's
going
to
jump
in.
"remember,"
no
religion
and
no
guns.
i
think
that's
not
good.
"oh,"
and
i
think
he's
like
pretty
light
on
oil
production
too.
but
a
man
and
"john,"
i
have
no
idea
who
you're
running
"against,"
but
nobody's
going
to
be
able
to
beat
john
cornyn.
he's
a
good
"man,"
you're
good
"man,"
thank
"you,"
john.

ours
right
from
the
"beginning,"

"you,"
kay.
we
have
a
man
who's
smart
as
hell
and
he
is
tough
and
he
is
mean
and
"nasty,"
but
he
loves
this
state
and
he's
only
mean
and
nasty
because
he
wants
to
defend
you
and
me
and
all
of
the
horrible
things
that
we
all
go
"through,"
louie

we
got
him

he
wouldn't
leave
us
no
matter
what.

out
long
before
anybody
else

it
figured
"out,"

thank
you
john.
a
man
i
saw
on
television
last
night
defending
"me,"
brilliantly
defending
me.
i
actually
don't
like
doing
this
"usually,"
but
i
tweeted
"out,"
i
"said,"
"\"thank"
you
very
much
brian
babin.
that
was
a
great
"defense,"
i
appreciate
"it.\""
thank
you
"brian,"
that
was
great
last
night.
see
i
put
a
tweet
out
because
it's
easier
than
making
a
phone
call
and
talking
for
a
half
"hour,"
thanks
brian.
i
just
said
thanks.
and
you
know
"what,"

great
people
along
with
republican
party

and
all
of
these
total
winners.
here's
"one,"
ronna
"mcdaniel,"
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
you
"know,"
ronna
was
the
head
of
michigan.
michigan
hadn't
been
won
by
a
republican
for
decades
and
it
was
tough.
they
all
said
you
couldn't
win
michigan.
i
"said,"
"\"why?"
we're
getting
these
massive
"crowds,"
"why\"?"
and
she
was
in
charge
of
michigan
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor.
find
out
who
this
woman
is.
she's
driving
me
crazy.
she
calls
"me,"
just
one
more
"trip,"
"sir,"
one
more
trip.
who
is
she?
who
is
"she?\""
and
it
was
ronna
and
we
won
the
state
of
"michigan,"
we
won.
and
when
it
came
"time,"
when
it
came
time
to
picking
somebody
to
head
the
"rnc,"
republican
national
"committee,"
i
"said,"
"\"what"
about
that
woman
that
drove
me
crazy
from
"michigan?\""
and
it
was
ronna
and
she's
done
a
fantastic
job.
thank
"you,"
thank
"you,"
ronna.
thank
"you,"
she's
fantastic.
and
a
great
governor
from
your
"state,"
he's
a
"great,"
great
man
and
a
friend
of
mine.
and
together
with
your
lieutenant
governor
dan
patrick.
well
you
had
a
"hurricane,"
two
years
ago
now.
they
still
keep
calling
me
for
money.
"\"sir,"
could
you
give
us
"another?\""
when
the
governor
called
"up,"
dan
was
"there,"
"\"thank"
you
for
being
so
generous
to
"texas,"
"sir,"
the
"hurricane.\""
it
was
a
big
"one,"
it
was
a
bad
one.
a
lot
of
water
dump.
i
think
the
biggest
dump
of
"water,"
remember
kept
going
in
and
"out,"
in
and
out.
our
coast
guard
saved
"16,000"
lives.
but
it
kept
going
in
and
"out,"
"water,"
water.
and
finally
i
get
a
call.
i
paid
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
to
the
state.
like
"numbers,"
my
people
are
driving
me
crazy.
i
get
a
call
from
the
governor
and
dan
is
there.
where's
dan?
is
he
here?
where's
dan?
"dan,"
dan
patrick.
and
the
two
of
them
call
me.
and
then
i
had
ted
cruz
on
my
back
and
i
had
john
cornyn
on
my
back
and
i
had
the
congressman
calling
and
it
was
"brutal,"
it
wasn't
even
fair.
and
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
thank
you
for
being
so
generous
on
the
"hurricane.\""
they
made
a
fortune.
you
made
a
fortune
on
the
hurricane.
"\"thank"
you
for
being
so
"generous,"
sir.
"sir,"
we
want
one
more
small
"request,"
just
a
"small,"
it's
not
much
and
we
appreciate
your
listening
to
us.
we
want
to
build
a
dam
in
the
ocean
so
that
if
we
ever
have
another
"hurricane,"
"sir,"
the
water
won't
be
able
to
come
into
houston
and
all
of
the
areas
that
have
came
"into,"
"sir,"
do
you
think
we
could
do
it?
i
"said,"
"\"how"
much?
it's
only
$10
billion.
$10
"billion!\""
right
"ted,"
right?
$10
billion
they
"wanted,"
10.
and
you
know
the
way
they
sell
it
and
it's
so
good
they're
"salesman,"
they're
incredible
salesman.
they
say
it's
only
10
billion.
i'm
supposed
to
be
happy.
"oh,"
let's
"see,"
could
we
give
texas
an
extra
10
billion
for
"some,"
crazy
thing
that
may
work
and
it
may
"not,"
right?
"no,"
they're
great
people.
they
love
your
state.
"rnc,"
"co-chairman,"
tommy
"hicks,"
a
real
friend
of
ours.
thank
"you,"
tommy.
and
our
great
campaign
"manager,"
the
most
sophisticated
man
with
a
computer
you've
ever
seen.
remember
they
used
to
say
with
"hillary,"
her
campaign
is
so
sophisticated.
then
after
she
"lost,"
they
"said,"
trump's
campaign
was
so
sophisticated.
and
remember
she
spent
like
six
times
more
on
this
stuff
than
we
did.
you
know
the
old
"days,"
my
father
taught
"me,"
if
you
can
spend
"less,"
that's
a
good
thing
not
a
bad
"thing,"
right?
my
father
"said,"
if
you
can
spend
less.
so
we
spent
much
less
then
"hillary,"
crooked
"hillary,"
crooked
hillary.
where
are
those
"emails,"
hillary?
they
may
find
those
"33,000"
emails.
they're
"looking,"
they
may
find
those
deleted
emails.
they
may
find
them.
remember
the
"emails,"
"33,000"
emails
covering
her
gym
and
her
daughter's
"wedding,"
"33,000"
that's
a
lot
of
emails
for
a
wedding
and
working
out.
but
brad
parscale
did
a
great
job.
thank
"you,"
"brad,"
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
brad.
and
secretary
of
"commerce,"
one
of
the
legends
of
wall
"street,"
he
was
really
like
amazing
and
he
is
doing
an
incredible
"job,"
wilbur
ross.
thank
"you,"
wilbur.
smart
guy.
and
a
friend
of
"mine,"
he's
another
one.
he
was
so
tough.
he
was
"nasty,"
man.
"boy,"
he
hit
me
during
the
campaign.
i
"said,"
"\"that"
guy's
"ruthless.\""
and
when
it
was
sort
of
"over,"
there
was
nobody
more
gracious
and
i
called
"him,"
i
made
him
secretary
of
"energy,"
he's
done
a
phenomenal
job.
and
rick
perry
couldn't
have
done
a
better
"job,"
"truly,"
truly.
and
he's
going
to
be
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
probably
coming
back
here.
whatever
he
does
it's
going
to
be
successful.
but
he
spent
three
years
with
us
and
i
want
to
thank
"you,"
"rick,"
what
a
job
you
"done,"
thank
you.
what
a
job
he's
done.
he
was
also
a
great
governor
of
texas
that
you
know.
in
everything
we
"do,"
we're
fighting
for
the
faithful
citizens
of
this
country.
this
includes
putting
a
stop
to
the
catastrophic
era
of
endless
wars.
endless
"wars,"
they
don't
stop.
they
don't
stop.
they
go
on
forever.
we
become
policemen.
we
end
up
becoming
"police,"
were
policing
these
countries.
that's
not
what
it's
about.
we've
spent
eight
trillion
dollars
in
the
middle
east.
thousands
of
american
soldiers
have
lost
their
lives.
tens
of
thousands
more
have
been
severely
"wounded,"
and
in
all
"fairness,"
the
other
side
has
lost
millions
of
people.
"millions,"
millions
of
"people,"
think
of
it.
these
wars
brought
mass
"chaos,"
"instability,"
destruction
and
death.
today
we
choose
a
different
path.
we
had
tremendous
success
today.
i
don't
know
if
you've
seen
it.
we
built
in
the
last
three
"years,"
we
built
the
strongest
military
by
far.
and
i
told
this
"story,"
i
was
embarrassed
to
tell
"it,"
but
now
i'll
"tell,"
when
i
first
got
"in,"
a
general
told
me
we
could've
had
a
conflict
with
someone
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
don't
have
"ammunition.\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
never
want
to
hear
a
president
…
i
just
never
want
to
hear
somebody
have
that
statement
made
to
them
again
as
president
of
the
united
"states,"
we
don't
have
"ammunition.\""
think
of
how
bad.
now
we
have
so
much
ammunition
we
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it.
and
as
you
all
"know,"
i
guess
you've
been
watching
today.
i
sent
vice
president
pence
and
secretary
of
state
pompeo
to
lead
an
american
delegation
to
meet
with
president
erdogan
of
turkey.
they
got
there
today
and
it
did
work.
without
spilling
a
drop
of
american
"blood,"
not
one
drop
of
american
blood.
we've
all
agreed
on
a
pause
or
a
ceasefire
in
the
border
region
of
syria
and
it
was
unconventional
what
i
did.
i
"said,"
"\"they're"
going
to
have
to
fight
a
little
while.
sometimes
you
have
to
let
them
fight
a
little
while.
then
people
find
out
how
tough
the
fighting
"is.\""
these
guys
know
right
up
"here,"
these
guys
"know,"
right?
sometimes
you
have
to
let
them
fight
like
two
kids
in
a
lot.
you
got
to
let
them
fight
and
then
you
pull
them
apart.
but
it
was
"unconventional,"
but
they
fought
for
a
few
days
and
it
was
pretty
vicious.
and
the
"kurds,"
who
are
our
friends
and
turkey's
our
friend.
but
they
"fought,"
it
was
tougher.
i
mean
it
was
nasty
and
you
couldn't
make
a
deal
for
"15,"
think
of
"it,"
for
15
"years,"
20
"years,"
they
couldn't
make
a
deal.
the
kurds
didn't
want
to
move.
turkey
didn't
want
to
"budge,"
and
turkey
was
having
a
lot
of
bad
things
happen
from
this
region.
in
all
fairness
to
"turkey,"
they
were
having
a
lot
of
"bad,"
but
they
didn't
…
now
all
of
a
sudden
they're
fighting
and
it's
not
fun
having
bullets
going
all
over
the
place.
and
we
went
there
and
we
"said,"
we
want
to
"pause,"
and
the
kurds
have
been
terrific.
they're
going
to
move
back
a
little
bit.
we're
going
to
keep
isis
all
nice
and
locked
"up,"
okay.
we're
going
to
find
more
of
them.
and
turkey's
all
set
and
president
erdogan
one
was
great
and
we're
going
to
take
the
worst
sanctions
and
tariffs
and
everything
that
i
put
on
the
"country,"
we
put
the
"worst,"
i
"mean,"
i
don't
think
they
could
have
economically
"survived,"
but
that
doesn't
matter.
president
erdogan
was
a
gentleman.
he
understood
"it,"
but
without
a
little
tough
love.
you
know
what
tough
love
"is,"
right?
without
a
little
tough
"love,"
they
would
have
never
made
this
deal.
president
obama
lost
a
million
people
in
the
"area,"
a
million
"people,"
a
million
people.
so
now
we're
doing
a
five
day
"period,"
we're
going
to
see
if
we
can
get
it
all
finalized
and
i
think
it
will
"be,"
i
think
it
will
be.
so
turkey's
going
to
be
happy.
the
kurds
are
going
to
be
"happy,"
isis
is
going
to
be
unhappy.
we'll
deal
with
whoever
we
have
to
deal
"with,"
but
we'll
get
it
done.
and
it's
a
great
tribute
to
a
lot
of
very
talented
people
and
thank
you
to
vice
president
pence
and
thank
you
to
mike
pompeo.
good
"job,"
good
job
and
they're
traveling
back
to
our
country
by
night.
they're
traveling
back
and
they'll
be
back
soon
and
we'll
have
a
big
conference
on
it.
but
it
was
a
terrific
thing
and
we've
taken
care
of
a
lot
of
religious
persecution.
we
added
that
in.
a
lot
of
things
are
in
that
agreement
that
nobody
ever
thought
possible.
so
we
have
to
fundamentally
change
our
approach
to
homeland
security
as
an
example.
in
that
"example,"
nobody
would've
ever
done
that.
you
have
to
be
a
little
bit
different
to
do
it
that
way.
i
took
a
lot
of
"heat,"
even
from
some
of
our
"congressman,"
even
from
some
of
our
"senators,"
but
now
they're
all
happy
and
i'm
happy
with
them.
i'm
happy
with
them.
"now,"
i
don't
know
what
about
the
democrats?
the
democrats
will
"say,"
"\"oh,"
what
a
terrible
"…\""
anything
we
do
the
democrats
will
criticize.
if
i
"said,"
like
on
the
china
"deal,"
"\"we"
get
beijing
for
one
"dollar.\""
they
would
"say,"
"\"what"
a
terrible
"deal.\""
it
just
doesn't
work
with
them.
you
know
the
wall.
we
spend
so
much
time
with
them
on
the
wall
and
i
realized
about
two
weeks
"ago,"
all
i
had
to
do
is
"say,"
"\"we"
will
never
build
a
"wall.\""
and
they
would
have
come
through
and
they
"said,"
"\"we"
demand
that
you
build
"it.\""
it
would
have
been
so
much
"easier,"
right.
would
have
been
so
much
"easier,"
"ted,"
would've
been
so
much
easier.
american
combat
troops
should
not
be
at
the
center
of
ancient
sectarian
conflicts
all
over
the
world.
bring
our
soldiers
back
home.
bring
our
soldiers
back
home.
the
same
people
pushing
us
to
fight
endless
wars
overseas
want
us
to
open
our
borders
to
mass
migration
from
these
war
torn
and
terror
afflicted
regions.
their
policies
would
import
terrorism
right
onto
our
shores
with
american
issued
visas.
"oh,"
isn't
that
wonderful?
and
by
the
"way,"
the
democrats
want
open
borders.
they
want
everybody
to
flow
in.
they
want
those
caravans
to
flow
"in,"
the
caravans.
and
they
wouldn't
get
rid
of
the
loopholes.
but
you
know
what?
mexico's
been
great.
mexico
today
had
"27,000"
soldiers
on
our
border
and
we've
stopped
this
horrible
migration
of
people.
and
many
of
them
are
bad
people.
you
know
when
countries
send
them
"up,"
they're
not
sending
their
"finest,"
"okay,"
use
your
"heads,"
they're
not
sending
their
finest.
you've
got
to
see
some
of
the
people.
but
now
we
send
them
back.
and
by
the
"way,"
ice
is
fantastic.
they've
taken
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
ms-13
killers.
they've
taken
thousands
of
killers
and
brought
them
back.
and
now
we've
made
deals
with
guatemala
and
honduras
and
el
salvador
and
mexico.
but
we've
made
deals
now
where
we
can
bring
"back,"
there
are
"45,000"
people
waiting
in
mexico.
but
it's
going
to
be
very
tough
for
these
people
ever
to
get
back.
when
did
you
ever
hear
that?
used
to
have
no
people
waiting
in
mexico.
they
just
flooded.
our
borders
are
getting
strong.
when
the
wall
is
"complete,"
there'll
be
as
strong
as
any
borders
anywhere
in
the
world.
my
administration
believes
in
a
simple
"principle,"
the
best
way
to
keep
foreign
terrorists
out
of
america
is
deny
"them,"
just
deny
them
admission
in
the
first
place.
it's
really
pretty
simple.
and
that
is
why
i
have
"imposed,"
and
we
had
passed
and
we
won
at
the
united
states
supreme
"court,"
a
travel
ban
on
some
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
countries
and
places.
but
if
democrats
seize
"power,"
they
would
throw
the
floodgates
wide
"open,"
wide
open.
we
would
have
people
coming
into
our
"country,"
look
at
what's
going
on
in
california
and
the
people
of
california
don't
want
"it,"
they
"say,"
come
into
california.
we'll
give
you
free
"healthcare,"
free
education.
why
wouldn't
…
i
may
even
move
to
california
if
they
keep
going.
"no,"
but
all
it
does
is
it
brings
everybody
in.
what's
wrong
with
these
people?
we're
rebuilding
our
military
stronger
than
ever
before
and
we
are
not
going
to
deplete
it
again
on
"stupid,"
"senseless,"
endless
wars.
we've
invested
more
than
two
and
a
half
trillion
dollars
restoring
our
armed
forces
and
all
of
it
was
built
in
the
usa
and
that
includes
approving
the
construction
of
almost
200
f-35
"fighters,"
"stealth,"
stealth.
and
many
of
them
are
built
right
"here,"
right
here.
you
know
that
"right,"
in
fort
worth.
as
we
restore
our
"security,"
we're
also
restoring
our
prosperity.
america
is
winning
again
and
america
is
respected
again.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
have
to
say
"this,"
so
outside
they
have
close
to
"30,000"
people.
and
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
the
fire
"marshal,"
fill
up
this
little
"area,"
let
them
"in,"
it
would
be
so
nice.
you
know
they
have
a
certain
"max,"
we
broke
the
record
tonight.
good
place.
last
"month,"
unemployment
reached
its
lowest
level
in
51
years.
seven
million
americans
have
been
lifted
off
food
stamps
since
the
election.
what
a
great
…
one
point
three
million
children
have
been
lifted
out
of
"poverty,"
think
of
that.
and
african
"american,"
hispanic
american
and
asian
american
unemployment
rates
have
reached
the
lowest
levels
in

our
great
hispanic
american
population
has
reached
a
poverty
"level,"
which
is
a
all
time
low
in
u.s.
history.
and
after
years
of
"stagnation,"
wages
for
hispanic
americans
are
rising
"fast,"
up
nearly
eight
percent
since
my
election
and
everybody
in
the
fake
news
would
have
said
that's
absolutely
impossible.
medium
"income,"
think
of
"this,"
median
income
for
hispanic
americans
has
surpassed
"$50,000"
a
year
for
the
first
time
ever.
with
republicans
in
"congress,"
we
passed
the
largest
package
of
tax
cuts
and
reform
by
far
in
american
history.
by
the
"way,"
the
democrats
want
to
raise
your
"taxes,"
you
know.
i
don't
mean
a
little
bit.
i
don't
mean
a
little
bit.
i
mean
like
double
them
"up,"
triple
them
up
and
it's
still
won't
pay
for
the
nonsense
they
want.
we
eliminated
a
record
number
of
regulations
and
we
ended
the
war
on
a
thing
called
american
"energy,"
which
is
very
good
for
texas.
since
my
"election,"
natural
gas
production
in
texas
has
increased
35%
and
oil
production
has
increased
by
"60%,"
six
oh.
and
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
"world,"
world.
yet
every
major
democrat
running
for
president
wants
to
abolish
all
production
of
oil
and
natural
gas.
i
think
they
want
to
go
to
"windmills,"
"windmills,"
you
know.
"\"darling,"
i
want
to
watch
trump
speak
tonight.
we
can't
"darling,"
the
wind
isn't
"blowing.\""
they
want
windmills.
in
other
"words,"
they
want
to
annihilate
your
texas
economy.
can
you
imagine?
no
more
"oil,"
no
more
natural.
so
here
we
have
a
few
"people,"
right?
no
"guns,"
no
"religion,"
no
"oil,"
no
natural
gas.
abraham
lincoln
could
not
win
texas
under
those
circumstances.
couldn't
do
"it,"
couldn't
do
"it,"
ted.
couldn't
do
"it,"
louis.
abraham
"lincoln,"
honest
"abe,"
couldn't
do
"it,"
"louie,"
right?
remember
i
used
to
say
i
can
be
more
"presidential,"
look.
i've
always
said
i
can
be
more
presidential
than
any
president
in
history
except
for
honest
abe
lincoln
when
he's
wearing
the
hat.
that's
"tough,"
that's
tough.
that's
a
tough
one
to
beat.
"no,"
it's
much
"easier,"
being
presidential
is
easy.
all
you
have
to
do
is
act
like
a
"stiff,"
look.
remember
the
last
"election,"
they
said
these
phonies
in
the
"back,"
they
"said,"
texas
is
in
play.
they
said
you'd
toss
in
play
too.
and
i
came
"here,"
we
had
rallies
like
this.
thousands
of
people
outside
that
couldn't
get
in.
and
i
"said,"
"\"why"
is
texas
in
"play?\""
they
say
because
it's
"voting,"
it's
suppression.
they
try
and
get
your
hopes
down.
they're
suppressed.
this
is
just
like
fake
news.
but
they
said
"texas,"
they
said
texas
is
in
play.
"\"ladies"
and

texas
is

this
is

o'clock
and
usually
they
have
to
take
hours
and
sometimes
at
least
even
if
it's
"big,"
they
take
a
half
an
hour.
the
texas

and
we
won
by
a
lot.
we
won
by
a
lot.
and
we
won
florida
and
we
won
south
carolina
and
we
won
georgia
and
we
won
north
carolina
and
we
won
pennsylvania.
we
won
a
lot.
remember
these
phony
"people,"
there
is
no
way
to
get
to
270
you
had
to
get
to
…
so
i
kept
going
to
maine.
i
love
"maine,"
but
maine
"too,"
you
get
one.
it's
cut
in
half.
maine
too
you
get
one.
i
went
there
four
or
five
times
because
…
they
got
me
"up,"
the
"phonies,"
they
got
me
up
to
"269,"
couldn't
get
to
270
so
i
went
…
i
"won,"
by
the
"way,"
i
won
maine
too.
i
got
one.
but
i
went
there
and
i
went
there
a
lot.
that's
the
beautiful
thing
about
the
electoral
"college,"
you
go
everywhere.
you
don't
just
spend
the
three
…
winning
the
popular
vote
would
be
much
easier.
i'd
rather
have
that.
i'd
go
to
four
states
and
relax.
i
went
to
21
states.
i
used
to
be
a
believer
in
the
"other,"
but
i
think
winning
…
it's
like
you're
a
track
star.
you're
working
out
for
the
a
hundred
yard
dash
or
the
"mile,"
it's
a
different
form
of
training.
it's
a
different
form.
but
we
did
great.
they
said
he
cannot
get
to
270
and
they
were
right.
we
got
to
306.
after
decades
of
economic
"surrender,"
i
have
taken
historic
action

…
have
taken
historic
action
to
confront
china's
rampant
trading
"abuses,"
and
we've
made
great
progress.
and
our
relationship
with
china
is
"fantastic,"
and
great
things
are
happening.
you
watch.
they
get
it
now.
they
get
it.
and
a
lot
of
good
things
are
happening.
we're
replacing
nafta
with
"disastrous,"
i
"mean,"
it's
"been,"
to
"me,"
probably
…
i
used
to
call
it
the
worst
trade
deal
in
history.
i
think
the
world
trade
has
been
…
"wto,"
what
a
real
"beauty,"
the
world
trade
organization.
that's
a
real
beauty.
they
consider
china
a
developing
nation.
and
because
you're
a
developing
"nation,"
"ted,"
right?
they
consider
china
to
be
a
developing
"nation,"
and
because
they're
"developing,"
they
get
tremendous
…
and
we
wrote
them
letters.
we
don't
consider
them
to
be
a
developing
nation.
we
don't
consider
india
to
be
a
develop…
because
they're
ripping
us
off.
and
we
didn't
win
any
cases
at
the
"wto,"
and
now
we
just
won
$7.5
billion
of
countries
that
were
taking
taking
advantage
of
us.
and
we've
won
a
lot
of
cases
lately.
we
didn't
win
anything
for
years
practically.
now
we've
won
a
lot
of
cases.
you
know
why?
because
they
know
i'll
leave
if
they
don't
treat
us
fairly.
they
know
it.
and
then
the
piggy
bank
is
gone
where
they
all
rob
from.
we're
replacing
the
nafta
disaster.
and
we
have
to
get
this
crazy
nancy
pelosi
to
put
this
thing
up
for
a
vote.
we
have
to
get
her.
and
the
usmca
is
a
giant
victory
for
texas
"farmers,"
"ranchers,"
"manufacturers,"
"workers,"
and
oil.
the
democrats
should
pass
"it,"
overwhelmingly.
they
will.
but
nancy
has
to
put
it
up
for
a
vote.
do-nothing
democrats.
they're
do-nothing.
nowhere
is
the
democrat
betrayal
of

nation
more
dramatic
than
on
immigration.
in
recent
"debates,"
did
you
see
these
debates?
do
you
believe
what
i'm
competing
with?
i
don't
"know,"
when
i
had
to
compete
with
ted
"cruz,"
that
was
brutal.
he
was
the
national
debate
"chamption,"
a
story
i've
never
told.
i
never
did
that
"before,"
right?
i
ran
for
office.
all
of
a
"sudden,"
i'm
supposed
to
be
debating
tomorrow
night.
""
"\"who"
are
these
"people?\""
the
"hell,"
i
don't
know
all
of
them.
i
know
a
lot
of
them.
i
contributed
to
a
lot
of
them.
they
used
to
treat
me
very
nice
when
i
contributed
to
them.
not
so
nice
when
i
was
their
"opponent,"
that
changed
a
lot.
""
"\"let"
me
"see,"
i
want
to
"see,"
who
are
these
"people?\""
i'm
going
to
a
debate.
i
never
debated.
my
whole
life
has
been
a
"debate,"
but
i
never
debated
with
a
"podium,"
and
"this,"
and
that.
""
"\"who"
are
"they?\""
and
we
had
17
"people,"
plus
me.
we
had
18.
it
was
actually
not
"17,"
it
was
18.
remember
gilmore?
nobody
remembers
him.
but
we
had
18
people.
i
"said,"
"\"who"
are
these
people?
are
they
any
good
at
"debating?\""
and
i
hired
a
debate
"coach,"
and
he
lasted
for
about
10
minutes.
""
"\"this"
guy
knows
less
than
i
"do.\""
he
didn't
know
anything.
he
didn't
know
"anything,"
it's
true.
he
"said,"
"\"never"
ever
interrupt
while
they're
"speaking.\""
""
"\"okay,"
coach.
put
me
"in,"
"coach.\""
and
after
a
couple
of
those
"statements,"
i
mean
…
i
"mean,"
you
can't
beat
ted
cruz
if
you
don't
interrupt
him.
it's
impossible.
but
my
first
…
it's
true.
so
i
"see,"
"\"let"
me
see
the
cards.
let
me
see
the
whole
thing.
i
want
to
see
it.
i
need
help.
i'm
going
to
be
debating
in
front
of
millions
of
"people.\""
and
everyone's
"saying,"
"\"do"
you
think
trump's
going
to
be
able
to
debate
"professionally?\""
""
"\"let"
me
see
these
"cards.\""
""
"\"you"
"know,"
he
was
president
of
his
class.
one
guy
was
a
good
debater
in
college.
he
was
"this,"
he
was
"okay.\""
but
they
give
me
the
first
"card,"
ted
"cruz,"
and
it
"says,"
"\"national"
debate
champion
from
"princeton.\""
is
that
right?
and
"then,"
"\"national"

""
"\"my"

i
got
a
"problem.\""
""
"\"some"
of
these
guys
are
okay.
they
were
only
president
of
the
"class.\""
almost
all
of
them
ran
for
president
of
the
class.
i
never
did.
i
liked
playing
baseball
better.
but
i
"said,"
"\"melania,\""
and
i
called
"ivanka,"
i
called
my
"kids,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
got
a

ted
cruz
was
the
national
"debate,"
he
was
the
number
one
guy
in
college.
he
was
the
number
one
guy
in
law
school.
how
the
hell
do
i
beat
a
guy
that's
that
good
at
"debating?\""
but
we
came
out
"okay,"
ted.
and
"ted,"
ted
was
tough.
smart
as
hell
and
tough.
tough.
good
man.
but
it
is
true.
the
first
card
i
looked
"at,"
"seriously,"
it
was
ted
cruz.
and
he
was
"literally,"
i
"mean,"
national
"debate,"
he
was
the
best
in
all
of
college
and
in
law
school.
and
he's
a
talented
guy.
"no,"
he
says.
i
don't
think
so.
every
single
democrat
candidate
for
president
raised
their
hand
in
favor
of
giving
free
healthcare
to
all
illegal
aliens.
they
want
to
give
more
to
illegal
aliens
than
they
give
to
american
citizens.
you
see
that.
as
"president,"
i
will
never
allow
the
democrats
to
take
away
your
healthcare
dollars
and
give
them
to
people
that
are
in
our
country
illegally.
can't
do
it.
in
"fact,"
i
just
signed
an
executive
action
to
protect
american
healthcare
benefits
for
all
american
citizens.
among
those
hardest
hit
by
illegal
immigration
are
millions
of
legal
immigrants
right
here
in
"texas,"
including
millions
of
"patriotic,"
hardworking
mexican-americans
who
play
by
the
"rules,"
pay
their
"taxes,"
follow
our
"laws,"
and
strengthen
our
communities.
whether
you
are
a
first-generation
or
"tenth-generation,"
and
every
american
"citizen,"
and
you
"do,"
you've
been
treated
so
badly.
but
you're
not
being
treated
badly
anymore.
you
know?
we
got
rid
of
the
individual
mandate
from
crazy
obamacare.
every
american
citizen
deserves
a
government
that
defends
your
"jobs,"
your
"safety,"
your
"family,"
your
"borders,"
and
is
always
loyal
to
you
for
a
change.
we're
loyal
to
you.
my
administration
has
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
by
over
60%
since
may.
and
that's
with
no
help
from
the
democrats.
they
won't
close
up
the
loopholes.
they
won't
close
the
"loopholes,"
and
we
could
do
it
in
15
minutes.
and
we're
building
the
wall
and
we're
doing
all
of
these
"things,"
but
the
democrats
won't
close
up
the
loopholes.
you
know
what
the
loopholes
"are,"
right?
how
about
catch
and
release?
you
catch
them.
you
"say,"
"\"hello,"
"darling,"
how
are
you?
could
you
please
give
us
your
name
and
phone
"number?\""
they
don't
have
a
phone.
"\"could"
you
give
us
your
"address?\""
they
don't
want
to
have
that
have
a
phone?
could
you
give
us
your
address?
they
don't
want
to
have
an
address
that's
in
honduras.
"\"could"
you
please
give
us
your
address
and
your
"name?\""
they
can't.
they
"say,"
"\"that's"
okay.
we
catch
and
we
"release,\""
and
they
go
into
our
country.
and
then
we
are
getting
them
out
of
the
country.
and
you
know
what?
some
are
very
good
people.
some
are
unbelievably
dangerous
and
bad
people.
and
we're
focusing
on
the
bad
and
they're
getting
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
okay?
while
we're
fighting
for
shared
"priorities,"
the
american
"people,"
the
democrat
party
has
never
been
farther
outside
of
the
mainstream.
they've
gone
nuts.
every
democrat
running
for
president
is
pushing
a
healthcare
agenda
that
would
utterly
eviscerate
medicare.
my
administration
will
always
protect
medicare
for
our
beloved
seniors.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions.
our
ambitious
campaign
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
has
produced
the
largest
decline
in
drug
prices
in
over
51
years.
people
don't
talk
about
it.
the
press
will
not
talk
about
it.
we
have
news
conferences.
we
tell
them
"this,"
they
will
not
put
it
in
the
press.
you
have
no
idea
how
dishonest
the
media
is.
you
have
no
idea.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
womb
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
and
that
crackpot
governor
from
virginia
executes
the
baby
after
birth.
you
saw
"that,"
right?
after
birth.
you
remember
that
one
from
last
year.
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
"abortion,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
crazy
"politicians,"
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
they're
"corrupt,"
like
schiff
is
corrupt.
he's
corrupt.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
it's
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
it's
also
the
party
of
honest
abe
lincoln.
we
forget
that.
we
got
to
use
that
more
often.
don't
you
think?
honest
abe.
i
liked
honest
abe.
we've
confirmed
…
he
says
"\"honest"
"donald.\""
thank
you.
explain
that
to
them.
you're
right.
we've
confirmed
152
federal
judges
to
apply
the
law
as
"written,"
including
two
supreme
court
"justices,"
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh.
when
i
got
into
"office,"
they
say
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
"do,"
i
actually
think
it's
"defense,"
but
they
say
is
the
appointment
of
federal
judges.
so
when
i
got
"in,"
"always,"
when
you
get
"in,"
there
are
none.
"\""
how
many
do
you
"have?\""
"\"i"
have
none.
"none.\""
so
i
got
"to,"
i
"say,"
"\"how"
many
federal
judges
do
i
"have?\""
"\"sir,"
you
have
142
federal
"judges.\""
"\"no,"
you
don't
understand
the
"question.\""
that's
impossible.
that
would
mean
that
president
obama
didn't
appoint
142
judges.
you
get
none.
or
you're
doing
a
bad
job
as
president
because
you're
representing
a
different
philosophy.
very
different.
""
"\"actually,"
"sir,"
the
number
is
142.
we
were
right
the
first
"time.\""
""
"\"obama"
was
…
he's
such
a
wonderful
"president.\""
how
are
you
a
wonderful
president
when
the
most
important
thing
you
can
"do,"
you
handed
over
to
the
republicans.
142.
how
is
that
good?
i
"mean,"
how
is
that
good?
if
i
were
a
"democrat,"
i
wouldn't
be
too
happy
about
that
number.
and
we'll
have
a
record
number
of
judges
by
the
time
our
term
is
over
in
16
"years,"
maybe
20.
i'm
only
kidding.
i'm
only
kidding
because
every
time
i
do
"that,"
they
"say,"
"\"see,"
he's
assuming
"control.\""
we
have
this
crazy
guy
on
television.
and
he
"goes,"
"\"you"
know
"…\""
he's
talking
to
a
"guest,"
he
"goes,"
"\"you"
know
he's
going
to
"win,"
don't
you?
you
know
he's
going
to
"win.\""
i
"mean,"
we've
done
a
good
job.
he
should
be
happy.
but
he
"said,"
"\""
our
"military,"
our
"schools,"
our
"this,"
"everything.\""
he
"says,"
"\"you"
know
he's
going
to
"win.\""
and
the
guest
"goes,"
"\"well,"
"no,"
we're
going
to
fight.
we're
going
to
"fight.\""
"\"no,"
"no,"
he's
going
to

and
you
know
he's
never
leaving.
you
know
"that,"
don't
you?
he's
never
leaving.
he's
never
going
to
"leave.\""
and
i
thought
this
wacko
was
kidding.
he's
a
comedian.
i
thought
he
was
kidding.
he's
serious.
he
really
believes
that.
we
"passed,"
for
the
"veterans,"
va
choice
and
va
accountability
on
behalf
of
those
great
people.
they've
been
trying
to
pass
it
for
almost
50
years.
they
couldn't
get
it
done.
but
those
guys
right
"there,"
and
"me,"
we
got
it
done.
and
to
protect
american
"security,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
one-sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
we
also
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
you've
seen
it
many
times.
"\"oh,"
i'm
so
"sorry.\""
now
you
have
a
president
who's
standing
up
for
america
and
standing
up
for
your
great
state
of
texas.
""
about
you.
i'm
doing
this
for
you.
you
"know,"
we
"had,"
in
"2016,"
i
really
believe
it
was
maybe
the
greatest
election.
i
guess
george
washington
was
"good,"
right?
but
that
was
easy.
and
by
the
"way,"
he
did
even
better
percentage-wise
in
judges
than
i
did.
he
had
100%.
but
we
could
have
50%.
that's
not
bad.
and
i
had
many
more
than
he
had.
so
i
guess
you
got
to
give
george
"washington,"
what
do
you
"think,"
"ted,"
you
got
to
give
him
something?
i'd
say
honest
"abe,"
that
was
a
pretty
good
"election,"
right?
andrew
"jackson,"
they
say
ours
topped
andrew
jackson.
but
andrew
jackson
was
a
good
election.
but
we
had
among
the
greatest
elections
of
all
time.
but
we
have
to
now
cement
that
election.
we
got
to
cement
it.
and
once
we
"do,"
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
take
this
beautiful
experiment
apart.
that'll
be
very
hard.
because
it's
all
about
your
family.
it's
all
about
your
future.
and
it's
all
about
the
future
fate
of
our
great
country.
so
important.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
of
more
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican

this
is
the
state
where
a
small
band
of
patriots
at
the
battle
of
"gonzalez,"
armed
with
a
single
"canon,"
stared
down
a
foreign
army
and
"declared,"
"\""
come
and
take
"it.\""
""
they
loved
their
"families,"
they
loved
their
"country,"
and
they
loved
their
god.
these
courageous
texas
patriots
did
not
shed
their
"blood,"
"sweat,"
and
tears
so
that
we
could
sit
at
home
while
others
try
to
erase
their
"legacy,"
demolish
our
"liberty,"
and
destroy
our
proud
american
heritage.
we
will
"never,"
ever
allow
that
to
happen.
with
your
"help,"
your
"devotion,"
and
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
fighting.
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
and
together
we
will
make
america
wealthy
again.
we
will
make
america
proud
again.
we
will
make
america
strong
again.
we
will
make

safe
again.
and
we
will
make

great
again.
thank
"you,"
texas.
thank
you.
.
thank
you.]
[
thank
you
very
much
everybody.
thank
you.
wow.
i
will
"never,"
ever
let
you
"down,"
that
i
can
tell
you.
amazing.
and
i
want
to
thank
manchester
and
new
"hampshire,"
they're
very
special.
you
remember
those
primaries?
that
primary
came
around
and
remember
what
happened
during
the
primary?
trump
should
come
in
third
or
"fourth,"
and
we
came
in
easily
number
"one,"
and
that
was
the
beginning.
that
was
an
easy
one.
i
want
to
thank
you
all.
this
is
incredible
and
it's
great
to
be
back
in
a
state
that
i
love
with
thousands
of
hardworking
"patriots,"
who
are
the
heart
and
soul
of
america.
and
that's
what
you
are.
we're
actually
here
today
to
officially
launch
our
campaign
to
win
the
great
state
of
new
hampshire
in
2020.
and
i
saw
some
fake
polls
put
out
by
the
fake
news
"media,"
and
it
said
that
i'm
tied
with
three
of
the
other
"candidates,"
the
"democrats,"
i'm
tied
in
new
hampshire.
i
don't
think
so.
one
of
them
has
a
"rally,"
he's
got
100
people.
so
this
holds
"12,000"
we're
full.
and
we
could
fill
it
up
four
times
at
least.
we
could
fill
it
up
four
times.
but
i
just
want
to
thank
you
all.
i
just
think
it's
going
to
be
a
tremendous
four
years.
we're
going
to
have
a
tremendous
four
years.
can
you
believe
it?
we
only
have
a
little
more
than
a
year
to
"go,"
where
it
all
"started,"
right?
the
greatest
political
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
even
though
we
had
fake
witch
hunts
on
our
back
and
all
the
other
things
that
we
had
to
go
"through,"
we
have
taken
this
big
beautiful
"ship,"
and
it's
being
turned
around
very
quickly.
three
years
"ago,"
we
campaigned
across
the
country
on
a
pledge
to
make
america
great
again.
and
that's
exactly
what
we've
done.
i
think
we
can
honestly
say
it's
the
greatest
slogan
in
the
history
of
politics
in
america.
make
america
great
again.
so
if
you
don't
"mind,"
the
other
candidates
"go,"
they
spend
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
on
this
question
that
i'm
going
to
ask
you.
they
spend
millions.
you
remember
the
first
slogan
from
our
opponent?
that's
"right,"
neither
do
i.
neither
does
anybody.
nobody
remembers.
the
only
thing
i
remember
is
the
first
night
i
went
out
after
i
heard
it
and
i
"said,"
"see,"
it's
all
about
her.
and
they
immediately
changed
it
after
spending
like
a
million
dollars.
it's
all
about
her.
that
didn't
work
out
too
well.
that
slogan
wasn't
too
good.
so
we
have
to
do
this.
we
have
to
make
a
decision.
do
you
give
up
the
greatest
slogan
in
the
history
of
politics
in
our
country?
make
america
great
"again,"
right?
do
we
give
up
make
america
great
again
for
a
new
"slogan,"
because
"look,"
our
country
is
doing
great.
we
are
doing
very
well
with
china
despite
the
fact
that
they
want
to
have
you
believe
in
the
contrary.
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
"china,"
how
you
doing?
they're
not
too
"happy,"
they're
not
too
happy.
they're
losing
millions
of
jobs.
the
tariffs
are
"working,"
and
they're
eating
the
tariffs
by
the
way.
there's
no
price
increase.
you
"know,"
you
gotta
talk
to
these
people.
the
fake
news.
but
do
we
give
up?
and
by
the
"way,"
the
biggest
"beneficiary,"
you
know
who
have
been
great?
our
great
farmers
have
been
so
incredible
because
they've
been
targeted
by
"china,"
and
frankly
they've
been
targeted
for
a
long
"time,"
including
by
incompetent
politicians
that
have
run
this
country
for
a
long
time.
so
we're
making
up
for
a
lot
of
lost
ground.
but
do
we
give
up
make
america
great
for
keep
america
great?
keep
america
great.
"okay,"
you
ready?
ready?
i
love
this
because
it's
free.
and
we
have
all
the
time
in
the
"world,"
right?
is
there
anything
better
than
a
trump
rally?
what
about
a
sleepy
joe
biden
rally?
"well,"
he's
made
some
beauties.
i
sort
of
hope
it's
him.
i
don't
mind
any
of
them.
you
got
pocahontas
is
rising.
we
got
kamala.
kamala
is
falling.
you
got
beto.
beto
is
like
gone.
all
"right,"
we'll
see
what
happens.
whoever
it
"is,"
i
don't
know
that
it
"matters,"
but
whoever
it
is
"different,"
different
people.
but
i
don't
"know,"
i
think
sleepy
joe
may
be
able
to
limp
across
the
finish
line.
but
today
they
announced
that
they're
going
to
cut
way
back
on
his
appearances
because
he
is
such
a
"disaster,"
they're
going
to
have
fewer
appearances.
you've
heard
"that,"
right?
they're
going
to
cut
way
back
on
his
appearances.
can
you
believe
it?
if
i
ever
did
"that,"
it
would
be
over.
the
fake
news
would
get
"us,"
but
we
don't
let
them
get
us
and
it
is
fake.
and
today
the
deputy
editor
of
the
new
york
times
was
demoted.
isn't
that
beautiful?
all
the
news
that
is
not
fit
to
print.
all
the
"news,"
the
fake
failing
new
york
times.
it's
really
"we,"
it's
not
me.
we're
doing
it
together.
they
came
from
the
"hills,"
they
came
from
the
"mountains,"
from
the
"rivers,"
they
came
from
all
over
the
place.
and
they
showed
up
and
they
voted
like
nobody's
seen
before.
and
it
was
306
to
"223,"
remember?
306.
and
we
won
wisconsin
and
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
we
never
thought
of
"that.\""
got
to
think
about
those
things.
and
we
won
michigan.
and
now
we
have
a
lot
of
car
companies
coming
into
"michigan,"
and
we
have
a
lot
of
great
farming
events
"happening,"
really
big
in
wisconsin.
and
we
have
incredible
things
going
on
in
pennsylvania.
we
just
opened
up
a
$10
billion
plant.
we
have
many
of
them
going
up.
many
of
"them,"
a
lot
of
jobs.
in
"louisiana,"
an
lng
plant
$10
billion.
could
never
have
"happened,"
could
never
have
happened.
pennsylvania
would
have
never
happened.
they
wouldn't
have
allowed
him
to
frack.
so
they
would've
never
been
able
to
build
it.
but
what
a
place
that
"is,"
it
will
be
open
in
a
little
more
than
a
"year,"
but
i
have
to
make
a
decision.
it's
a
big
decision.
do
we
give
up
the
greatest
"theme,"
"phrase,"
"logo,"
whatever
you
want
to
call
"it,"
in
the
history
of
"politics,"
"risky,"
for
a
brand
new
one
because
make
america
great
again.
we're
really
sort
of
"there,"
and
we
have
a
little
time
left.
and
now
we
have
a
group
of
socialists
or
"communists,"
could
be.
they're
not
far
away.
the
fake
news
will
hit
me
on
that.
how
dare
he
say
that?
but
they're
not
far
"away,"
right?
they're
not
far
away.
95%.
does
anybody
want
to
pay
95%
taxes?
i
don't
think
so.
but
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
their
plan
because
as
far
as
i'm
"concerned,"
the
green
new
deal
is
a
beautiful
thing.
"no,"
it's
a
beautiful
thing.
we
want
it
to
continue
onward
until
about
a
month
before
the
election.
i
will
let
them
have
it
like
you've
never
heard
before.
i
don't
want
it
to
change.
too
early.
it's
like
elizabeth
warren.
i
did
the
pocahontas
thing.
i
hit
her
really
"hard,"
and
it
looked
like
she
was
down
and
"out,"
but
that
was
too
long
ago.
i
should've
waited.
but
don't
worry.
we
will
revive
it.
it
can
be
revived.
it
can
be
"rewritten,"
right?
it
will
be
revived
and
it
can
be
revived
very
easily
and
very
quickly.
and
we're
going
to
have
some
fun
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
now
what
do
we
"do,"
ready?
let
me
have
first
make
america
great
"again,"
then
keep
america
"great,"
right?
just
applaud
like
crazy
for
the
one
you
want
to
use
for
this
campaign.
and
there's
a
possibility
we'll
use
both.
there's
a
possibility
we'll
use
both
'cause
i
hate
like
hell
to
give
up
the
one.
is
it
a
possibility
we'll
use
both?
maybe
one
a
little
bit
less.
are
you
ready?
so
we'll
start
make
america
great
"again,"
and
then
keep
america.
are
you
ready?
who's
in
favor
of
the
campaign
theme
being
make
america
great
again?
who's
in
favor
of
our
theme
being
keep
america
great?
"oh,"
wait
a
minute.
this
is
your
hat.
i
was
going
to
keep
it
actually.
thank
you.
so
that's
really
been
the
reaction.
i've
done
this
before.
big
"crowds,"
and
it
really
is
keep
america
great
because
we
have
these
socialists
want
to
take
it
away
from
us.
they
want
to
take
it
away.
because
until
a
couple
of
days
"ago,"
and
that'll
catch
up
very
"quickly,"
we
have
no
choice.
by
the
"way,"
i
never
said
china
was
going
to
be
"easy,"
but
it's
not
tough
and
they
want
to
make
a
deal.
we
just
spoke
to
them
yesterday.
they
want
to
make
a
deal.
they
want
to
make
a
deal.
they
have
to
make
a
deal.
and
you
know
what?
it'd
be
wonderful
to
make
a
deal.
i
don't
think
we're
ready
to
make
a
deal.
we're
taking
in
billions
of
dollars
in
tariffs.
and
"again,"
china's
devaluing
their
currency.
they're
pouring
out
"money,"
the
prices
haven't
gone
up.
so
that
means
we're
taking
in
billions
of
dollars.
we're
not
paying
for
it.
and
ultimately
their
devaluations
are
going
to
hurt
them
very
badly.
they
want
to
make
a
"deal,"
and
they
should
want
to
make
a
deal.
but
when
you
listen
to
the
fake
"news,"
look
at
how
many
there
are.
i
"mean,"
i
actually
had
something
today.
i
had
something
today.
are
we
sure
that
we're
in
new
hampshire?
you
"know,"
you
have
a
reputation.
i
"mean,"
i
know
it's
not
true
'cause
i
know
you
too
well.
you
have
a
reputation
of
being
very
"stayed,"
"very,"
very
"elegant,"
"stayed,"
incredible
people.
you're
not
acting
it
"tonight,"
and
that's
good.
that's
a
good
thing.
wow.
we
love
our
country.
we
have
enthusiasm
for
our
country.
that's
what
it
is.
before
the
"election,"
our
factories
were
closing.
"hey,"
who
knows
it
better
than
you?
you're
like
central
casting
for
the
closing
of
factories.
our
jobs
were
vanishing.
our
military
was
totally
depleted.
when
i
took
"over,"
our
military
was
sad.
we
weren't
flying
half
of
our
"planes,"
they
were
old.
they
were
tired.
our
equipment
was
tired.
our
people
weren't
"tired,"
though.
our
people
weren't
tired.
but
everything
we
"had,"
it
was
depleted.
now
we've
rebuilt
our
military
like
never
before.
and
all
made
in
the
"usa,"
just
so
you
know.
and
our
nation
was
weakened
at
home
and
disrespected
abroad.
they
don't
disrespect
us
"anymore,"
folks.
i
got
nato
to
pay
an
extra
hundred
billion
dollars.
they
weren't
paying.
they
were
delinquent.
many
nations
"were,"
except
for
seven.
many
nations
weren't
paying
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
"paying,"
so
we're
supposed
to
protect
them.
they
kill
us
on
trade.
they
have
all
sorts
of
barriers
and
everything
else.
the
taxes
are
really
unfair.
the
tariffs
were
"ridiculous,"
what
they
do
to
us
in
europe.
and
then
we
protect
them.
then
they
don't
"pay,"
and
i
"say,"
"\"i'm"
sorry
"folks,"
you
have
to
pay.
you
have
to
"pay.\""
they
were
"delinquent,"
they
were
delinquent.
and
my
biggest
fan
is
secretary
general
stoltenberg
from
nato.
he
said
until
president
trump
came
"along,"
we
were
"going,"
boom.
they
would've
been
finished
very
"quickly,"
but
i'm
tired
of
paying
for
other
nations
"anyway,"
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you.
"today,"
our
nation
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
we're
now
stronger
than
ever
before.
you
saw
we
ended
the
iran
disaster.
how
about
that?
we
paid
them
a
$150
billion.
$1.8
billion
in
cash.
"cash,"
"cash,"
cash.
we
got
nothing.
and
they
also
want
to
make
a
deal.
china
wants
to
make
a
"deal,"
and
i
will
tell
you
iran
wants
to
make
a
deal
because
the
sanctions
are
not
good
for
them.
they
are
not
happy.
so
we'll
see
how
it
all
turns
out.
but
it's
in
good
hands.
it's
in
good
hands.
the
united
states
right
now
has
the
hottest
economy
anywhere
in
the
world.
we're
rebuilding
that
awesome
might
that
we
were
just
talking
about.
our
united
states
armed
forces.
america
is
working
again.
america
is
winning
"again,"
and
america
is
respected
"again,"
respected
like
never
before.
they
respect
us
"again,"
and
you
see
it.
you
"know,"
a
recent
poll
came
out
where
it
showed
that
president
obama
was
more
popular
in
germany
and
other
places
than
i
am.
and
i
"said,"
of
course
he's
more
popular.
he's
not
demanding
that
they
pay
for
their
protection
that
we
provide.
he's
not
doing
that.
i'm
doing
that.
and
in
"fact,"
if
i
was
the
most
"popular,"
i'm
not
doing
my
job
right.
so
true.
we've
created
over
six
million
new
jobs
since
the
election.
if
i
would
have
said
that
during
the
"campaign,"
those
people
back
there
would
have
been
"headlines,"
headlines.
more
than
seven
million
americans
have
been
lifted
off
of
food
stamps.
since
my
"election,"
the
number
of
new
businesses
starting
in
the
great
state
of
new
hampshire
has
skyrocketed
by
almost
25%.
and
you
can't
really
go
by
my
election.
you
gotta
go
by
november
9th
because
the
markets
have
gone
through
the
roof
since
november
9th.
that's
the
day
after
i
won
the
election.
so
i
won
the
election.
the
markets
went
up
thousands
of
points.
things
started
happening.
you
started
doing
things
that
you
would've
never.
even
though
i
didn't
get
sworn
in
until
january
"20th,"
but
they
refused
to
do
that.
and
let
me
tell
"you,"
if
for
some
reason
i
wouldn't
have
won
the
"election,"
these
markets
would
have
crashed.
that'll
happen
even
more
so
in
2020.
see
the
bottom
line
is
i
know
you
like
me
and
this
room
is
a
love
"fest,"
i
know
that.
but
you
have
no
choice
but
to
vote
for
me
because
your
401ks
down
the
tubes.
everything's
going
to
be
down
the
"tubes,"
so
whether
you
love
me
or
hate
"me,"
you
got
to
vote
for
me.
i
had
a
businessman
the
other
"day,"
one
of
the
most
successful
guys
in
the
country.
i've
never
liked
"him,"
never
liked
him.
he
never
liked
"me,"
i
never
liked
him.
i
see
him
in
the
white
house.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
are
you
doing
"here?\""
he
"said,"
i'm
working
to
make
sure
you
get
"elected.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you've"
got
to
be
kidding.
you
don't
like
me.
i
don't
like
you.
what
the
hell
is
this
all
"about?\""
he
"said,"
"\"that's"
right.
we've
had
our
differences.
i
haven't
liked
"you,"
but
to
be
honest
with
"you,"
mr.
"president,"
i
have
no
"choice.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
right.
you're
"right.\""
first
thing
i've
ever
heard
him
say
that
i
agreed
"with,"
he's
got
no
choice.
he
got
no
choice.
unemployment
in
new
hampshire
has
reached
the
lowest
rate
in
actually
31
years.
but
within
a
very
short
period
of
"time,"
it
will
be
the
lowest
rate
in
the
history
of
our
country.
think
of
that.
you
have
the
best
"unemployment,"
you
have
the
most
successful
state
in
the
history
of
your
"state,"
and
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
then
you're
going
to
vote
for
somebody
else?
"oh,"
great.
let's
vote
for
elizabeth
pocahontas
warren.
we
have
the
best
numbers
we've
ever
had.
let's
vote
for
somebody
else.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
"happen,"
folks.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
happen.
only
with
fixed
poles
does
that
happen?
unemployment
for
african
americans.
you've
heard
me
say
this
many
"times,"
and
i'm
very
proud
of
it.
hispanic
americans
and
asian
americans
have
all
reached
their
lowest
rates
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
county.
wages
are
rising
quickly.
remember
when
i
used
to
say
people
have
been
working
two
and
three
jobs
making
less
money
than
they
made
21
years
ago?
i
used
to
say
it
all
the
time.
now
i
can
say
for
the
first
time
in
20
"years,"
wages
are
"rising,"
and
you
know
who's
the
biggest
beneficiary?
blue
collar
workers.
my
administration
is
fighting
to
expand
opportunity
for
citizens
of
every
background
and
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
very
important.
because
we
are
all
americans.
we
all
share
the
same
home.
we
all
share
the
same
heart.
we
all
share
the
same
dreams.
we
are
all
children
of
the
same
almighty
god.
but
at
the
very
moment
when
our
country
should
be
coming
together
to
enjoy
these
wonderful
"blessings,"
the
radical
democrats
are
trying
to
tear
america
apart.
they
vilify
anyone
who
doesn't
share
their
extreme
views.
they
slander
our
law
enforcement
heroes.
you
see
what
they're
doing
with
our
police
that
we
love.
you
see
what
they're
doing.
has
anyone
ever
seen
anything
like
the
water
being
thrown
on
new
york's
finest?
have
you
ever
seen?
and
i
know
a
lot
of
new
york's
finest.
they're
not
"happy,"
they're
not
happy.
and
they
are
great
people.
these
are
"great,"
"great,"
proud
people.
for
that
to
be
allowed
to
happen
is
a
disgrace.
they
view
everybody
as
fascist
and
nazis.
they
used
the
term
nazi.
this
was
a
"term,"
you
couldn't
even
use
it.
now
they
use
it
like
on
a
regular
basis.
nazi.
he's
a
nazi.
think
of
that.
he's
a
nazi.
you
couldn't
use
it.
now
they
use
it.
they
accuse
our
heroic
border
agents
of
running
concentration
"camps,"
and
they
do
an
incredible
job.
and
the
democrats
don't
want
to
fix
the
loopholes
or
asylum.
they
do
an
incredible
"job,"
our
border
agents.
and
they
looked
down
upon
the
hardworking
citizens
who
truly
make
our
country
run.
but
while
the
democrats
rage
and
resist
…
that
guy's
got
a
serious
weight
problem.
go
"home,"
start
exercising.
get
him
out
of
here
please.
you
got
a
bigger

than
i
do.
got
a
bigger
problem
than
all
of
us.
now
he
goes
home
and
his
mom
"says,"
"\"what"
the
hell
have
you
just
"done?\""
we
are
continuing
our
incredible
"movement,"
the
greatest
political
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country.
there's
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
never.
our
movement
is
built
on
"love,"
and
it
"is,"
and
we
love
our
family.
we
love
our
faith.
we
love
our
"flag,"
and
we
love
our
"freedom,"
and
that's
what
it's
about.
and
add
to
that
the
fact
that
we
love
our
neighbors
and
we
love
our-
…
the
fact
that
we
love
our
neighbors
and
we
love
our
country.
together
we
are
all
united
by
one
fundamental
principal.
a
nation's
first
duty
must
always
be
to
its
own
"citizens,"
it's
own.
we've
got
to
take
care
of
our
own.
you
haven't
heard
that
from
a
politician
or
a
political
leader
in
a
long
time.
it's
called
america
first.
it's
america
first.
we're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
many
tremendous
republican
leaders
and
great
friends
of
"mine,"
a
man
who's
doing
an
incredible
job
as
your
"governor,"
because
i
want
to
take
100%
of
the
credit
for
the
incredible
turnaround
of
new
"hampshire,"
and
i
remember
it
not
so
long
"ago,"
things
were
not
looking
good.
people
were
"leaving,"
a
lot
of
bad
things
were
"happening,"
but
we
have
to
give
him
a
lot
of
credit.
he's
been
a
great
"governor,"
chris
"sununu,"
with
a
great
father
"too,"
great
father.
with
a
great
father…
his
father
was
tough.
"chris,"
your
father
was
so
tough.
he
was
for
somebody
else
in
the
"primaries,"
and
then
one
by
one…
i
won
"here,"
i
won
"there,"
i
won
there.
and
then
when
i
won
his
father
got
on
and
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
this
guy
kills
me.
he's
so
"tough,\""
and
he
"said,"
"\"president"
trump
will
be
the
greatest
of
all
time.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
happened?
what
"happened?\""
he
went
from
being
the
toughest
critic
to
the
best
there
is.
so
i
want
to
say
hello
to
your
"father,"
okay
chris?
you'll
tell
him.
great
guy.
what
a
family.
what
a
family.
thank
you
for
chris.

a
man
who
was
with
me
right
from
the
beginning.
in
"fact,"
he
had
a
meeting
at
his
house.
his
house
has
never
been
the
same.
his
house
is
a
disaster
now.
like
somebody
said
he
just
sold
it.
but
you
know
what?
because
of
the
trump
"economy,"
i'll
bet
he
sold
it
for
a
"big,"
"big,"
"fat,"
beautiful
profit.
where
is
steve?
steve
stepanek
and
his
"wife,"
who's
incredible.
did
you
make
a
lot
of
money
on
the
house?
we
destroyed
the
house.
this
was
the
beginning.
he
held
some
kind
of
a
meeting
for
"me,"
and
he
has
a
nice
"house,"
but
literally
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
showed
up
and
they
destroyed
his
house.
it's
never
been
the
same.
no
wonder
you
sold
it.
they
finally
gave
"up,"
and
that
was
four
years
ago.
"anyway,"
thank
you
very
much
both
for
being
here.
i
appreciate
it.
what
great
people.
thank
"you,"
steve.
great
job.
and
i
hope
the
buyer
of
his
house
didn't
hear
that
little…
steve.
i
hope
the
buyer
didn't
hear
what
i
just
said
about
your
house.
he'll
cancel…
that's
all
right.
you'll
sell
it
for
more
to
somebody
"else,"
don't
worry.

"know,"
ronna

up
"michigan,"

for
"many,"
many
years
nobody
won

as
a
republican.
but
i
used
to
"complain,"
i'd
go
there
and
i'd
say
"\"they're"
stealing
your
car

i'd
go
for
years.
in
"fact,"
five
or
six
years
before
i
even
thought
about
"running,"
for
whatever
"reason,"
they
named
me
man
of
the
year
in
michigan.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
"come?\""
i
didn't
even
understand
it
"myself,"
but
i
was
named
man
of
the
year.
i
wasn't
even
political.
that
was
years
before
i
did
this.
but
i
was
always
complaining
that
our
car
business
is
being
stolen.

of

we
are
bringing
it
back
at
a
level
that
nobody's
ever
seen
"before,"
our
car
business.
but
i
went
to
michigan
and
my
opponent
was
told
that
the
"republicans,"
no
way
you
can
win
"michigan,"
or
"wisconsin,"
that
you
just
can't.
and
we
had
a

named
ronna

ronna
wouldn't
stop.
"\"sir,"
can
you
be
here
next
"week?\""

"say,"
"\"i"

then
i
leave

she
"said,"
"\"sir,"
can
you
come
back
in
three
"days?\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't

i
do
it
and
she
"said,"
"\"how"
about

and
then
on

night
she
"said,"
"\"sir,\""
it
was

o'clock

while
before

calls

you
be

said
"\"tonight?\""
and
by
the

know
where
i
was?

was
in

that's
right.
she
"said,"
"\"sir,"

you
be
here
"tonight?\""
i
"said,"
"\"are"
you
"sure?\""
i
started
speaking
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning.
now
it's
election
day.
we
had
"32,000"
people
show
up.
it
was
like
this.
the
crowd
was
"just,"
they
want
to
see
things
happen
in
our

they
love
our
country.
it
went
crazy.

left

we
had
"32,000"
and
they
had
a
tiny
little
"crowd,"
and
i
looked
at
my
people
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"

not

should've.
we
did
great
in

we
should've
won
new
"hampshire,"

that's
okay.
i'm
not
holding
it
against
you
because
it
was
not
your

we
had
a
woman
in

i
"said,"

you.
the
same
with
another
"man,"
our
campaign
manager.
he
started
off
as
a
computer
"genius,"
and
remember
when
they
used
to
say
that
the
hillary
clinton
campaign
is
highly
"sophisticated,"
highly…
she
did
a
lot
of
bad
things
folks.
"33,000"

after
getting
a

from

remember
she
said
it
was
about
her
daughter's
wedding
and
yoga
"classes,"
"33,000,"
yes.
it
was
disgraceful.
i
will
tell
you
"this,"
we
now
have
a
great
attorney
general.
a
fair
"guy,"
a
great
gentleman.
another
man
who's
here
tonight
is
the
world's
tallest
campaign
manager.
he
is
an
unbelievable
talent.
but
they
were
saying
about
our
opponents…
i'm
not
going
to
mention
the
name
again
because
we'll
never
get
it
finished
"here,"
so
i'll
just
say
my
opponent.
is
that
better?
they
were
saying
how
sophisticated
her
campaign
was.
except
ours
was
far
more
"sophisticated,"
and
we
had
a
man
that
did
an
incredible
job.
he's
now
our
campaign
manager
and
he's
one
of
the
tallest
human
beings
i've
ever
seen.
his
name
is
brad
parscale
and
he
is
fantastic.
it's
nice
when
you
don't
have
to
look
for
anybody.
you
just
look
over
and
you
see
a
guy
who's
twice
as
tall
as
everyone.
great
"job,"
brad.
thank
you.
how
we

poll
numbers
in
a
lot
of

"ohio,"
iowa.
you
know
"iowa,"
every
week
that
they

we
gave
them
"ethanol,"

is
very
important.

of
things
for
"iowa,"

every
week
we
seem
to
be
going
up
in
iowa

they're
campaigning
in

wherever
they

go
up.
somebody's

put

driving

wild.

had
him
on
for

he'd
"say,"
"\"you"
can
"win,"
you
can
"win,"
you
can
"win.\""
and
finally
we
"said,"
"\"let's"
give
it
a
"shot.\""
and
i
had
"corey,"
i
had
"hope,"
i
had
just
a
couple
of
people.
we
had
a
rather
lean
and
mean
staff.
but
corey
lewandowski
loves
your
"state,"
loves
new
hampshire.
he
was
the
first
one
that
talked
about
us
possibly
winning
the
whole
big
ballgame.
he's
tough
and
he's
smart
and
i'm
hearing
he's
thinking
about
running
for
the
senate
from
new
hampshire.
there
we
go.
i
think
he'd
be
tough
to
beat.
i'll
tell
you
one
"thing,"
he'll
go
into
washington
and
he's
going
to
have
you
in
mind.
he's
going
to
do
a
job
if
he
does
do
"it,"
so
we'll
see
what
happens.
he
hasn't
made
up
his
mind
"yet,"
but
he
would
be
fantastic.
i
guess
it's
something
you
go
back
and
you
talk
to
your
"family,"
you
talk
to
your
wife
and
you
make
a
decision.
they're
all
"saying,"
"\"are"
you
going
to
support
"him?\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know
if
he's
"running.\""
so
"corey,"
let
us
know
"please,"
if
you
don't
mind.
let
us
know.
our
shared
republican
agenda
is
pro
"worker,"
pro
"jobs,"
pro
"family,"
pro
"growth,"
and
100%
pro
american.
for
decades
and
decades
the
permanent
politicians
in
washington
pursued
the
very
opposite.
they
sold
out
our
workers.
you
see
it.
you
know
it
better
than
any
place.
when
i
talk
about
the
horrors
of
"nafta,"
the
horrors
of
trade
deals…
i
"mean,"
i'm
sorry
to
tell
you
"this,"
i
usually
refer
to
new
hampshire.
nobody
took
it
worse
than
new
england
and
nobody
took
it
worse
than
new
hampshire.
"now,"
here's
the
good
news.
i
would
never
let
that
happen
again
and
chris
will
never
let
that
happen
again.
is
there
a
"doctor,"
please?
doctor
in
the
house?
thank
you.
doctor
in
the
house.
"please,"
"doctor,"
please.
thank
you
very
much.
take
your
time.
"yeah,"
take
your
time.
thank
you.
take
your
"time,"
fellas.
plenty
of
time.
you
"know,"
people
got
here
two
and
a
half
days
"ago,"
many
of
these
people
in
the
"front,"
right?
two
and
a
half
days
"ago,"
a
lot
of
these
"people,"
so
you
can
understand.
it's
pretty
tough.
thank
you.
thank
you.
that's
okay.
these
are
great
people.
these
are
great
people
that
love
our
"country,"
just
remember
that.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
pretty
good.
pretty
good.
so
our
politicians
shipped
away
our
"jobs,"
shed
our
"sovereignty,"
surrendered
our
"dignity,"
and
saddled
our
nation
in
one
foreign
debacle
after
"another,"
and
we're
still
here.
he
just
said
it.
we're
still
"here,"
you
better
believe
"it,"
and
we're
here
stronger
than
ever
before
we're
here.
but
all
of
that
ended
the
day
that
i
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
the
american
people
are
in
charge
of
their
country
again.
we
cut
a
record
number
of
job-killing
regulations
that
were
strangling
our
country.
we
cut
more
regulations
in
two
and
a
half
years
than
any
other
president
in
their
full
terms.
four
"years,"
eight
"years,"
or
in
one
case
more
than
"that,"
cut
more
than
anybody.
to
get
relief
to
working
families
we
passed
the
largest
package
of
tax
cuts
and
tax
reforms
in
the
history
of
our
country.
you're
making
a
lot
more
money.
you're
making
a
lot
more
money
and
you
see
it
and
you
know
it
because
you
see
it
in
your
paycheck
every
week.
we
ended
the
last
administration's
cruel
war
on
american
energy
and
we
are
delivering
a
policy
of
american
energy
independence
like
you've
never
seen
before.
in
"fact,"
if
you
look
at
the
straits
where
we're
having
all
of
the
"problems,"
you
look
at
the
"straits,"
number
"one,"
they're
not
touching
our
"ships,"
they're
not
playing
with
our
ships.
they're
taking
them
from
this
"country,"
from
that
"country,"
from
that
country.
but
you
know
what?
very
"importantly,"
we
have
very
few
ships
going
there
anymore
because
we
don't
need
that
oil
and
gas.
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
world.
every
leading
democrat
has
pledged
abolish
the
american
"oil,"
"coal,"
and
natural
gas
industries
that
are
fueling
our
economic
boom.
can
you
imagine
this?
we're
sitting
on
great
wealth.
they
want
to
take
it
away
from
"us,"
and
the
alternatives
don't
have
the
power.
they
don't
have
the
power.
they
want
"wind,"
wind.
wind
is
oh
so
"beautiful,"
as
long
as
you
don't
have
to
stare
at
a
windmill
and
your
house
goes
down
in
value
like
to
nothing.
"steve,"
if
you
had
a
windmill
anywhere
near
your
house
you
would've
gotten
one
third
of
the
price
you
"got,"
steve.
that's
"true,"
by
the
way.
steve's
too
smart
to
let
that
happen.
we
won't
let
them
take
it
away
from
you.
we
are
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
policies
that
shattered
new
hampshire
and
your
factories.
they
shattered
your
communities
and
they
shattered
american
power
and
american
prestige
all
around
the
globe.
new
hampshire
lost
one
in
four
manufacturing
jobs
following
nafta
and
china's
entrance
into
the
"organization,"
two
of
the
worst
deals
ever
in
the
history
of
our
"world,"
not
just
our
country.
election
after
"election,"
politicians
came
to
your
state
pretending
to
have
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
the
american
"worker,"
then
they
went
to
washington
and
let
other
countries
push
them
"around,"
and
special
"interests,"
buy
them
off
and
steal
your
jobs
and
take
your
companies.
that's
what
happened.
"me,"
i
don't
care
about
their
campaign
contributions.
it
doesn't
matter
to
"me,"
folks.
we
want
to
do
a
job.
we
want
to
do
a
great
"job,"
and
we're
setting
"records,"
and
you
know
who's
sending
us
the
money?
the
small
donors.
"well,"
we
have
big
"donors,"
but
we
have
small
donors
are
sending
us
the
money
for
the
election.
pretty
amazing.
that's
not
supposed
to
happen
to
a
"republican,"
but
it's
happening
to
this
republican
and
it's
happening
to
you.
every
vow
that
politicians
made
was
"broken,"
every
hope
was
"dashed,"
and
every
promise
turned
into
a
total
betrayal
of
new
hampshire
and
of
our
country.
but
in
this
"administration,"
we
have
something
those
sell-out
politicians
could
only
dream
of.
it's
called
strength
and
commitment.
we
don't
play
games.
we
don't
play
games.
after
years
and
years
of
building
up
other
countries
we
are
finally
building
up
our
"country,"
standing
up
for
our
"jobs,"
our
"workers,"
and
standing
up
for
our
dignity.
the
forgotten
men
and
women
of
america
will
never
ever
be
forgotten
again.
you
were
forgotten.
the
last
administration
with
sleepy
joe
and
obama
tried
to
ram
through
one
of
the
worst
trade
deals
ever
"negotiated,"
worse
than
"nafta,"
worse
than
wto.
it
was
called
the
trans-pacific
partnership.
it
would
have
been
a
disaster.
tpp
would
have
gutted
the
american
auto
industry.
it
would
have
been
in
shambles.
our
auto
industry
is
coming
back
so
strong.
it
would've
"gutted,"
would've
destroyed
the
industry.
but
in
my
first
week
in
office
i
proudly
withdrew
the
united
states
from
that
job-destroying
catastrophe.
we're
imposing
beautiful
well-placed
"tariffs,"
money
comes
"in,"
on
foreign
countries
that
cheat
our
"workers,"
steal
our
"jobs,"
and
break
all
the
"rules,"
i'm
sorry.
and
by
the
"way,"
they've
been
changing
and
charging
tariffs
on
us
for
years.
we
have
countries
that
charge
us
"100%,"
"200%,"
297%
in
the
case
of
canada
with
your
farm
products.
we're
not
going
to
stand
for
"it,"
and
"man,"
did
we
turn
things
around
and
we've
just
started.
if
companies
don't
want
to
pay
a
"tariff,"
i
have
one
simple
solution.
come
make
your
product
in
america.
come
make
your
product
in
new
hampshire.
zero
tariffs.
zero.
no
tariff.
together
we're
restoring
this
nation's
industrial
might
and
we
are
doing
it
with
american
"iron,"
american
"aluminum,"
and
american
steel.
we're
doing
it
steel.
steel
industry
is
high.
they
were
dumping
steel
all
over.
they
were
destroying
our
companies.
us
steel
"now,"
all
of
"them,"
they're
all
expanding.
the
steel
industry
is
back.
it's
doing
great.
we're
opening
up
mines
in
"minnesota,"
the
great
state
of
minnesota.
they
have
magnificent
mines
that
have
the
best
iron
ore
in
the
world
and
president
obama
closed
them
down.
maybe
we
can
get
representative
omar
from
minnesota
to
open
it
"up,"
but
i
don't
think
so.
she'll
open
them
up.
i
don't
think
so.
representative
"omar,"
that's
another
one.
we're
replacing
nafta
with
the
brand
new
usmca.
that's
mexico
and
canada.
great
deal.
the
usmca
will
create
countless
jobs
for
farmers
and
manufacturers
all
across
the
state.
we
need
congress
to
pass
the
usmca
immediately.
we'll
make
it
a
bipartisan
deal.
we
don't
even
want
credit.
the
unions
benefit.
the
non-unions
benefit.
everybody
benefits.
it
brings
it
back
to
fairness
and
it
makes
it
very
hard
for
our
companies
to
leave
our
"countries,"
go
to
mexico
or
canada.
we
lose
all
our
jobs.
we
lose
all
our
taxes.
we
end
up
with
empty
factories
and
plants.
it
makes
it
almost
impossible.
we're
not
going
to
have
that.
that
was
my
one
rule
that
i
had
to
have.
it's
going
to
be
"very,"
very
hard
for
companies
to
do
that.
i've
also
taken
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
chronic
trade
abuses.
earlier
this
"month,"
the
us
government
officially
labeled
china
for
the
first
time
ever
a
currency
"manipulator,"
another
promise
kept.
while
others
allowed
china
to
freely
loot
the
us
"economy,"
$500
billion
a
"year,"
not
"million,"
not
"million,"
billion
with
a
b.
we've
made
it
clear
that
the
theft
of
american
jobs
and
american
wealth
is
over.
yet
"today,"
the
wall
street
journal
editorial
board
and
some
others
continue
to
publish
foolish
articles
that
demonstrate
that
they
understand
nothing
about
trade
or
business.
nothing.
they
advocate
only
economic
surrender.
they
actually
"say,"
"\"go"
to
"china,"
take
off
the
"tariffs,"
make
a
"deal.\""
i
lose
all
the
cards
we
take
off
the
tariffs.
we
don't
have
any
cards.
think
of
it.
they
say
"\"go"
to
"europe.\"."
by
the
"way,"
the
european
union
is
worse
than
"china,"
just
smaller.
it
treats
us
horribly.
"barriers,"
"tariffs,"
"taxes,"
and
we
let
them
come
in.
it's
worse
than
china.
many
of
us
come
from
there.
i
do.
that's
what
it's
got
going.
that's
about
it.
they
treat
us
really
"badly,"
and
many
"others,"
"many,"
many
others.
india
tariffs
us
probably
higher
than
any
nation
anywhere
in
the
world.
we
have
tariffs
of
100%
on
products
and
much
more
than
that.
india.
so
we're
working
on
all
of
them.
i
called
prime
minister
modi.
i
"said,"
"\"mr."
prime
"minister,"
it's
not
fair.
we've
got
to
"change,"
we've
got
to
"change,"
we've
got
to
"change,\""
and
we're
talking
to
them
very
seriously.
we're
talking
to
a
lot
of
places.
but
when
the
wall
street
journal
comes
out
and
they
"say,"
"\""
"no,"
"no,"
take
the
tariffs.
go
and
talk
to
"china.\""
they've
been
trying
to
talk
to
them
for
25
years.
but
"actually,"
you
know
what?
they
really
haven't.
the
fact
is
the
leaders
that
were
in
my
"position,"
they
didn't
do
a
damn
thing.
they
didn't
talk.
they
didn't
talk.
past
leaders
followed
the
terrible
advice
of
these
editorial
boards
that
are
frankly
totally
inexperienced
in
"business,"
i
"guess,"
and
our
industries
were
utterly
decimated.
globalism
enriches
foreign
countries
at
our
expense.
globalism.
i
love
our
country.
i'm
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america.
i'm
not
the
president
of
the
the
world.
as
long
as
i'm
"president,"
america
will
never
bow
to
a
foreign
nation
like
we
were
for
so
many
years.
as
we
restore
our
"prosperity,"
we
are
also
restoring
public
safety.
we
are
fighting
to
reduce
violent
crime.
you
see
so
"much,"
and
over
the
last
25
years
so
much
"crime,"
and
ensure
that
every
american
can
live
in
safety
and
peace.
and
yet
with
all
that
you
"see,"
we've
had
one
of
the
best
years
of
crime
prevention
that
we've
ever
had.
it
wouldn't
seem
that
"way,"
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
years
because
those
gentlemen
that
we
just
"saw,"
the
law
"enforcement,"
they
do
a
great
job.
you've
been
reading
about
this
a
lot
lately.
we
are
working
very
hard
to
make
sure
we
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
insane
people
and
those
who
are
mentally
sick
and
shouldn't
have
guns.
but
people
have
to
"remember,"
"however,"
that
there
is
a
mental
illness
problem
that
has
to
be
dealt
with.
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger.
it's
the
person
holding
the
gun.
years
"ago,"
many
cities
and
"states,"
i
remember
it
so
"well,"
closed
mental
institutions
for
budgetary
reasons.
they
let
those
people
out
onto
the
street.
you
probably
have
your
examples
up
here.
i
can
tell
you
in
new
york
they
closed
so
many
of
them
and
they
let
really
seriously
mentally
ill
people
out
on
the
"streets,"
and
you
see
plenty
of
them
"today,"
even
today.
we're
going
to
have
to
give
major
consideration
to
building
new
facilities
for
those
in
need.
we
have
to
do
it.
and
at
the
same
"time,"
we
will
be
taking
mentally
deranged
and
dangerous
people
off
of…
…
mentally
deranged
and
dangerous
people
off
of
the
streets
so
we
won't
have
to
worry
so
much
about
that.
the
big
problem.
we
don't
have
those
institutions
anymore
and
people
can't
get
proper
care.
they're
seriously
ill
people
and
they're
on
the
streets.
we
can't
make
it
harder
for
"good,"
solid
law
abiding
citizens
to
protect
themselves.
we
will
always
uphold
the
right
to
self
defense
and
we
will
always
uphold
the
second
amendment.
we
will.
so
important.
one
of
the
most
powerful
promises
i
made
to
the
people
of
this
state
was
to
confront
the
opioid
and
drug
epidemic.
i
used
to
go
around
new
hampshire
more
than
any
state
and
you'd
"say,"
"\"sir,"
the
state
is
"infested.\""
you
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we'll
like
a
drug
"den.\""
you
tell
me.
and
i
didn't
really
see
it.
and
then
i
met
with
the
police
officers
and
fire
departments
and
all
the
people
that
do.
and
you
just
seem
to
have
a
bigger
problem.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
wall
is
being
built.
that's-
that's
going
to
stop
a
lot
of
it.
the
wall
is
being
built.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
build
the
wall.
it's
being
built.
you
"know,"
we
have
the
fake
news.
you
know
about
"that,"
where
they
…
a
wall
that's
lying
on
the
ground
in
a
very
important
section.
so
we
pick
up
the
"wall,"
it's
in
pieces.
i
mean
literally
it's
gone
and
we
build
a
brand
new
30
foot
steel
and
concrete
wall
and
the
fake
media
"said,"
"\"he"
didn't
build
a
wall.
that's
just
renovation.
there
was
no
"wall,"
it's
lying
on
the
"ground.\""
people
walk
right
over
and
it's
"rotted,"
"rusted,"
gone.
we
take
it
away.
we
put
a
brand
new
wall
up.
they
give
me
no
credit.
you
know
why?
because
they're
fake
news.
that's
why.
we're
building
a
lot
of
walls.
the
army
corps
of
engineers
is
doing
a
great
job.
they're
doing
a
great
job.
since
i
took
"office,"
we've
attacked
the
challenge
with
everything
we
have.
we
have
secured
a
record
$6
billion
in
new
funding.
opioid.
we
vastly
increase
the
distribution
of
overdose
reversing
"drugs,"
which
are
pretty
amazing
things.
we've
given
them
to
your
police
"department,"
your
fire
"department,"
pretty
amazing.
we
have
reduced
the
total
amount
of
opioids
prescribed
by
34%.
the
department
of
justice
has
prosecuted
more
than
3000
defendants
in
opioids
related
cases.
and
our
public
awareness
campaign
about
the
terrible
suffering
that
drugs
inflict
has
already
reached
58%
of
all
young
americans.
i
said
that
you
have
to
show
them.
we're
doing
ads
beautiful
ads.
shows
"them,"
and
you've
seen
them.
i
don't
even
want
to
describe
them.
they're
brutal.
but
we're
doing
ads
on
television
and
papers
about
how
bad
it
is
for
children
so
they
can
see
it.
because
the
greatest
thing
we
can
do
is
not
get
people
started
on
"drugs,"
right.
not
get
them
started.
it's
hard
to
get
off.
you
"know,"
we
can
get
them
off
and
we're
doing
it
and
it's
been
done.
but
it's
hard
to
get
off.
if
they
never
start.
it's
real
easy.
it's
real
easy.
so
we're
trying
to
get
young
"kids,"
you
won't
see
the
fruits
of
this
labor
for
a
little
while
because
it
takes
a
while.
but
we're
"really,"
we
are
working
so
hard
on
advertising
and
promotions
to
tell
young
"kids,"
children
how
bad
drugs
"are,"
how
dangerous
they
"are,"
how
horrible
they
"are,"
how
they
destroy
your
"brain,"
how
they
do
so
many
bad
things.
and
they're
really
very
tough
ads.
they're
hard
hitting
ads.
and
i
think
they're
having
a
big
impact.
you'll
see
over
time
you'll
see.
over
time
you'll
see.
but
we
still
have
much
work
to
do.
but
as
a
result
of
these
"efforts,"
last
year
we
saw
the
first
nationwide
decline
in
drug
overdose
deaths
in
31
years.
that's
pretty
amazing.
and
at
the
center
of
america's
drug
crisis
is
the
border
crisis.
vast
quantities
of
deadly
narcotics
are
being
smuggled
across
the
border
including
"meth,"
"cocaine,"
heroin
and
fentanyl.
and
as
part
of
my
trade
deal
with
"china,"
it's
been
very
important.
and
president
xi
said
he's
going
to
do
it.
so
far
he
has
not
done
it.
but
i
"said,"
"\"you"
have
to
stop
sending
us
"fentanyl.\""
have
to.
"\"and"
you
have
to
criminalize
in
china
the
making
of
"fentanyl.\""
and
so
far
he
has
not
come
"through,"
but
i
think
he
will.
you'll
"know,"
you'll
know.
yet
democrats
want
to
open
borders
and
republicans
want
strong
borders.
that
you're
difference.
one
wants
open
borders.
who
can
even
think
of
an
open
border?
think
of
it?
even
though
many
people
that
come
into
our
country
are
wonderful
"people,"
they're
are
still
coming
in
illegally.
they're
not
coming
in
through
merit.
but
what
about
the
bad
ones?
we
have
"serious,"
serious
criminals
that
want
to
come
"in,"
and
if
we
had
open
borders
they
would
be
flowing
in
like
you've
never
seen
before.
democrats
want
open
"borders,"
they
don't
mind
crime.
we
do
mind
crime
and
that's
the
way
it
is.
democrats
also
support
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
last
year
alone
sanctuary
cities
declined
more
than
"17,000"
requests
from
federal
authorities
to
hand
over
criminal
aliens
already
in
their
custody.
in
other
"words,"
"17,000"
criminal
aliens
were
released
by
these
cities
directly
into
us
communities.
you
don't
understand
even
what
the
hell
are
they
doing?
what
are
they
doing?
"17,000."
republicans
believe
our
city
should
be
sanctuaries
for
law
abiding
"americans,"
not
for
criminal
aliens.
we
will
always
support
the
amazing
heroes
of
ice
and
border
"patrol,"
and
we
will
always
support
law
enforcement.
every
democrat
candidate
also
wants
to
give
illegal
immigrants
free
welfare.
republicans
believe
public
benefits
should
be
protected
for
truly
needy
"americans,"
not
for
illegal
aliens.
and
we
should
reduce
our
taxes
and
many
other
things
with
all
of
that
money
that
we're
talking
about.
we
need
to
elect
a
strong
republican
majority
to
end
sanctuary
cities.
stop
human
"traffickers,"
stop
drug
smugglers
and
adopt
an
immigration
system
that
puts
the
needs
of
american
workers
and
families
first.
it's
also
time
for
democrats
to
join
with
us
to
protect
the
sacred
integrity
of
our
elections
by
supporting
voter
"id,"
voter
identification.
it's
incredible.
they're
constantly
"saying,"
"\"oh,"
we
need
to
protect
"them.\""
but
they're
not
looking
for
that.
they're
not
looking
for
that.
we
"say,"
"\"what"
about
voter
id?
in
other
"words,"
you
have
a
"picture,"
you
have
to
go
up.
what
about
voter
"id?\""
that
they
don't
want
to
"do,"
but
we
need
voter
id.
the
democrat
party
has
never
been
farther
outside
the
mainstream.
where
do
they
come
from?
you
"know,"
you
say
you
want
low
"taxes,"
good
"education,"
strong
"military,"
strong
borders.
you
want
to
have
safe
homes.
you
want
a
"house,"
you
want
low
interest
"rates,"
you've
got
low
…
"hey,"
you
got
low
interest
rates.
the
lowest
ever.
got
low
"rates,"
it's
a
good
time
to
refinance
your
"house,"
by
the
way.
great
time.
you
got
"everything,"
and
then
you
see
these
people
they're
against
…
they
have
no
idea
what
they're
doing.
they
have
no
idea
what
they're
against.
every
major
democrat
running
for
president
supports
a
massive
government
takeover
of
healthcare
that
would
raid
medicare
and
destroy
the
private
health
insurance
plans
of
millions
of
american
families
that
they
love.
my
administration
is
defending
your
right
to
choose
the
plan
and
the
doctor
that
is
best
for
you.
the
individual
mandate
is
gone.
the
most
unpopular
part
of
"obamacare,"
and
we
almost
have
obamacare
gone.
we're
close.
we
would
have
had
it
"before,"
but
we
had
a
vote
that
was
a
little
bit
surprising.
i'm
sure
none
of
you
knew
who
that
vote
was.
we
had
it
"done,"
repealed
and
replaced.
but
it's
going
to
happen
and
i
think
it's
going
to
actually
be
in
the
"end,"
actually
better.
you
watch.
so
we
got
rid
of
the
individual
"mandate,"
which
was
the
most
unpopular
part
of
obamacare.
and
we're
running
it
better.
you
"know,"
i
had
a
political
decision.
do
i
make
it
great?
alex
azar
our
"secretary,"
do
rerun
it
well
and
sort
of
"say,"
"\"hey,"
we
run
it
"well.\""
or
do
we
run
it
badly
and
have
everybody
upset?
we
"said,"
we
got
to
run
it
"well,"
but
it's
still
much
too
expensive.
it's
lousy
healthcare.
but
we
got
rid
of
the
worst
part
of
it.
individual
"mandate,"
individual
"mandate,"
where
you
have
the
privilege
of
buying
the
right
not
to
have
to
pay
for
expensive
insurance.
that's
no
good
health
insurance.
and
we
won't
…
and
you
got
to
remember
this.
"republicans,"
and
i
speak
for
every
one
of
"them,"
we
will
always
protect
pre-existing
conditions.
we're
going
to
"protect,"
always.
"right,"
got
to
do
it.
our
ambitious
campaign
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
has
produced
the
largest
decline
in
drug
prices
in
51
years.
the
only
decline
in
51
years.
we
have
launched
a
historic
initiative
to
require
price
"transparency,"
empowering
you
to
choose
the
lowest
price
for
yourself
and
for
your
family.
believe
it
or
"not,"
you
didn't
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
price
your
drugs.
who
could
even
believe
this?
i
wonder
if
big
pharma
had
something
to
do
with
that.
so
we're
going
to
have
transparency.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mothers
womb.
right
"up,"
up
till
…
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
and
in
the
case
of
the
virginia
"governor,"
he's
having
a
"rough,"
rough
time.
in
his
"case,"
the
baby
is
"born,"
and
then
he
goes
to
talk
to
the
mother.
the
doctor
talks
to
the
mother.
the
baby
is
now
"born,"
wrapped
as
he
"said,"
and
then
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
execute
the
baby.
who
would
believe
that.
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
"sacred,"
the
gift
of
god.
hard
to
believe
isn't
that.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
abortion
and
socialism.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
freedom.
we
are
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
the
american
dream
and
i'm
fighting
for
you
each
and
every
day.
so
importantly
we
have
confirmed
more
than
140
federal
judges.
within
90
days
it
will
be
179
federal
judges.
thank
you
very
much
president
obama.
thank
you
very
much.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
"them,"
but
i
came
to
office
and
i
had
138
judges
that
were
not
appointed
by
president
obama.
so
i
"say,"
thank
you
mr.
"president,"
very
good
and
they'll
say
he
was
a
great
president.
"oh,"
the
fake
news.
he
was
a
great
president.
if
he
was
a
great
president
how
come
he
left
me
138
judges
to
appoint
when
everybody
says
that's
the
single
most
important
thing
a
president
of
the
united
states
has
to
do.
great
president.
he
was
great.
he
was
a
great
president.
and
these
judges
will
apply
the
law
as
"written,"
including
we
appointed
two
great
supreme
court
"justices,"
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh.
and
to
help
patients
with
life
threatening
illnesses
we
also
pass
something
i'm
so
proud
"of,"
44
years
they
couldn't
get
it
"passed,"
right
to
try.
you
can
use
our
"newest,"
our
best
medicines.
incredible.
what's
happening.
i'm
so
proud
of
that.
and
this
from
"forever,"
five
decades.
we
pass
for
our
great
veterans
va
choice
and
va
accountability.
and
one
of
our
great
friends
was
a
veteran
who's
been
with
me
in
new
hampshire.
i
don't
know
where
you
are.
where's
our
guy?
where
is
he?
"so,"
al.
"so,"
i
walk
in
i
"said,"
hello.
he's
been
with
me
from
the
beginning.
he
wasn't
with
…
he
liked
trump.
and
i
came
in.
he
"said,"
"sir,"
he's
a
great
veteran.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
i
have
cancer.
and
"sir,"
i
went
into
the
vet.
they
were
"very,"
very
late.
they
had
problems.
i'm
not
blaming
"them,"
but
they
gave
me
the
right
to
go
out
and
get
a
great
cancer
"surgeon.\""
he
had
his
operation.
you
look
much
better
than
you
did
three
years
ago
"al,"
much
better.
much
better.
va
"choice,"
right
al.
va
choice.
great
story.
thank
you
very
"much,"
and
thank
you
for
your
loyalty.
he's
been
to
every
rally
i
ever
gave
a
new
hampshire
right
from
the
beginning.
i
got
so
tired
of
looking
at
him.
he'd
always
be
here.
now
he's
…
look
at
"him,"
now
he's
sitting
in
very
good.
that's
good.
but
i
appreciate
that
story.
i
appreciate.
va
choice
just
makes
"sense,"
right?
doesn't
it
make
sense?
we've
achieved
record
funding
for
the
united
states
military.
$716
"billion,"
$700
billion
and
$738
billion.
and
it's
almost
completely
rebuilt.
"including,"
and
we
hope
to
god
we
never
have
do
use
it.
we
have
the
"finest,"
most
powerful
nuclear
capability
anywhere
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
and
i
hope
to
god
we
never
have
to
use
it.
we're
investing
in
the
future
of
human
space
flight.
and
someday
soon
american
astronauts
will
plant
the
stars
and
stripes
on
the
surface
of
mars.
i
told
my
guys
at
"nasa,"
you
"know,"
"nasa,"
when
we
took
it
"over,"
it
was
exhausted.
the
runways
and
the
grounds
had
all
weeds
growing
through
the
cracks
in
the
concrete.
you
wouldn't
recognize
it
now.
it's
beautiful.
it's
the
best
place
anywhere
on
earth.
and
i
also
"said,"
"though,"
you
"know,"
i
hear
all
these
rich
guys
for
some
"reason,"
they
love
space.
so
they're
rich.
i
"said,"
let
them
send
the
rockets
up.
what
the
hell
do
we
have
to
do
it?
right?
so
i
see
jeff
bezos
and
elon
"musk,"
they're
putting
rockets
up.
i
think
it's
great.
and
they
pay
us
rent.
they
use
our
facility.
that's
great.
but
we're
also
doing
"it,"
and
nasa
has
some
of
the
greatest
plans
we've
ever
had.
these
are
great
"people,"
great
scientists.
but
we
also
let
the
private
sector
put
up
rockets.
the
one
which
recently
went
up
and
you
see
the
engines
coming
back
down
and
they
coming
…
there's
no
"wings,"
no
nothing.
it's
almost
"like,"
what
are
we
watching
is
this
fiction?
and
they
come
down
and
they
save
all
of
the
propellants.
all
of
"the,"
really
the
most
expensive
parts.
they're
able
to
save
it
by
bringing
it
back
right
to
where
it
took
off.
who
would
think
they
could
do
this?
i
never
saw
this
before
six
months
"ago,"
but
they're
doing
it
now
more
and
more.
they're
saving
a
lot
of
the
most
important
and
expensive
parts
of
rockets.
so
we
have
a
lot
of
rich
guys
paying
us
a
lot
of
rent.
but
we're
also
doing
it
ourselves.
to
protect
america's
security.
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
one-sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
just
three
months
"ago,"
we
also
recognized
the
golan
heights
as
being
a
part
of
and
protected
by
israel.
for
years
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
people
of
new
hampshire.
thank
you.
and
you
must
never
forget
the
2020
election
right
around
the
corner.
2020
right
around
the
corner.
and
it's
about
one
thing.
you
know
what
the
one
thing
"is,"
you.
it's
about
you.
it's
about
your
family.
it's
about
your
future.
and
it's
about
the
fate
of
your
country.
so
when
we
ran
together
last
"time,"
we
said
the
most
importantly
we
had
to
turn
it
around.
this
country
was
going
bad.
you
see
what
happened
to
venezuela
with
socialism?
venezuela
15
years
ago
was
one
of
the
richest
countries.
now
they
don't
have
"water,"
they
don't
have
"food,"
they
don't
have
anything.
and
this
was
one
of
the
richest
nations
in
the
world.
they
don't
have
anything.
we're
working
on
it.
we're
helping
"people,"
but
it's
very
sad.
it's
never
going
to
happen
to
us
because
we
will
never
ever
be
a
socialist
nation.
ever.
no
matter
what
label
they
"use,"
a
vote
for
any
democrat
in
2020
is
a
vote
for
the
rise
of
radical
socialism
and
the
destruction
…
the
destruction
of
the
american
dream.
we
have
a
dream.
it's
a
great
dream.
this
the
destruction
of
the
american
dream.
we
begin
this
campaign
tonight
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
"agenda,"
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
the
people
of
new
hampshire
and
for
the
people
of
america.
together
we
will
lift
millions
more
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
millions
and
millions
of
people.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
fair
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
are
already
happening
that
ensure
more
products
are
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
phrase
made
in
the
usa.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
and
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer.
something
i
never
thought
i'd
be
able
to
"say,"
within
one
decade
the
aids
epidemic
in
the
united
states
will
be
gone.
think
of
that.
did
you
ever
think
you
were
going
to
hear
that?
no.
did
you
ever
think
you
were
going
to
hear
that?
the
work
they've
done
on
aids
is
incredible.
that's
an
incredible
thing.
when
they
told
me
"that,"
it's
just
shattering.
it
"just,"
it
breaks
your
heart
what's
happened.
but
think
of
it
in
10
"years,"
the
aids
epidemic
will
be
eradicated.
so
great.
who
thought
that
was
going
to
be
happening.
who
thought
i'd
be
able
to
get
to
say
that
so
early
in
what
we're
doing
together.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together.
there
is
one
america
we
will
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we'll
stand
with
the
incredible
men
and
women
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
in
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
bureaucracy
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
through
every
day
and
every
challenge
our
hearts
speak
to
the
words
of
the
new
hampshire
state
"motto,"
live
free
or
die.
we
are
fighting
for
every
american
mom
and
dad
who
wants
to
protect
this
land
of
liberty
for
their
"precious,"
beautiful
children.
we
are
fighting
for
every
young
boy
and
girl
who
deserves
to
grow
up
in
a
nation
of
builders
and
"dreamers,"
pioneers
and
"patriots,"
and
we
are
fighting
for
every
citizen
of
the
greatest
republic
on
the
face
of
this
earth.
every
day
my
"presidency,"
we
will
never
forget
that
we
are
americans
and
the
future
belongs
to
us.
the
brave
this
"beautiful,"
"strong,"
"proud,"
and
free
future.
it
belongs
to
us.
it's
up
to
us.
we
control
our
own
destiny.
and
with
your
"help,"
your
devotion
and
your
drive.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
fighting
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
we
are
one
great
movement.
one
"people,"
one
family
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
and
together
we
are
making
america
wealthy
again.
we
are
making
america
strong
again.
we
are
making
america
safe
again.
and
we
are
making

[we

we
brought
you
a
lot
of
car
plants.
you
know
"that,"
right?
long
"time,"
it's
been
a
long
time
since
you
had
all
these
plants
being
"built,"
but
we
brought
you
a
lot
over
the
last
three
and
a
half
"years,"
and
we're
going
to
bring
you
a
lot
more.
that's
happening.
"hello,"
michigan
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
in
freeland
with
thousands
of
"loyal,"
hardworking
american
patriots.
fifty-four
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
"michigan,"
and
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
this
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
joe
biden
devoted
his
career
to
offshoring
michigan's
"jobs,"
outsourcing-
we
shouldn't
be
smiling
about
"it,"
but
we've
changed
it
around.
outsourcing
michigan's
"factories,"
throwing
open
your
"borders,"
dragging
us
into
endless
foreign
wars
and
surrendering
our
children's
future
to
china
and
other
far
away
lands.
biden
supported
every
disastrous
globalist
sellout
for
over
a
half
a
"century,"
including
"nafta,"
"china,"
and
dpp.
you
know
that.
joe
biden
surrendered
your
jobs
to
china
and
now
he
wants
to
surrender
our
country
to
the
violent
left
wing
mob
and
you're
seeing
that
every
night.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
mob
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
"rioters,"
"anarchist,"
arsonist
and
flag
burners
win.
but
i
wouldn't
worry
about
it
because
he's
not
winning.
i
don't
think
he's
winning.
this
is
not
the
crowd
of
a
person
who
comes
in
second
place.
you
do
know
that.
the
same
thing
happened
four
years
ago.
it
was
election
eve
but
by
the
time
i
got
"here,"
it
was
late.
some
of
you
are
in
that
audience
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
now
election
day.
we
had
"32,000"
people
show
up
and
the
reason
i
went
is
that
i
heard
that
crooked
hillary
"clinton,"
bill
clinton
and
barack
hussein
obama
were
traveling
to
michigan
because
they
heard
they
had
problems.
they
were
supposed
to
win
"michigan,"
but
they
did
such
a
lousy
job
that
they
had
to
come
and
get
some
votes.
they
came
and
i
heard
about
it.
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
could
you
do
"it?\""
i
hopped
in
the
plane.
we
landed
at
12
o'clock
in
the
evening.
i
started
speaking
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
now
election
day.
"32,000"
people.
she
had
500
people.
i
"said,"
"\"why"
are
we
going
to
lose
"michigan?\""
and
we
didn't.
and
we
didn't.
first
time
in
a
long
"time,"
but
now
we're
up
in
the
polls.
we
just
saw
polls.
we're
up
in
michigan.
i
don't
know
if
that's
good
or
bad.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
that's
good
or
bad
because
in
all
those
polls
where
we
were
down
last
"time,"
we
won.
so
maybe
we're
better
off
being
down
a
little
bit.
"hello,"
john
james.
i
see
you
handsome
guy.
john
"james,"
get
out
and
vote
for
john.
i'm
going
to
introduce
you
in
a
second
john
james.
what
a
job
you've
done.
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
he
"took,"
i
saw
this
group
of
people
that
were
"running,"
all
nice
"people,"
three
very
rich
people
and
one
guy
that
was
john
james
and
i
saw
them
all.
right?
i
saw
them
all
and
i
"said,"
"\"wait.\""
with
the
wonderful
invention
of
"tivo,"
one
of
the
"greats,"
you
can
play
it
back.
i
"said,"
"\"who"
was
"that?\""
he
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
"know,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"play"
it
"back.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that"
man
is
going
to
be
a
"star.\""
it
was
john
james.
that
was
in
the
republican
primary.
after
learning
about
him
with
his
incredible
career
and
"helicopter,"
and
he's
a
"great,"
and
actually
a
great
flyer
i
heard
the
other
"day,"
a
great
"one,"
a
really
good
one
as
opposed
to
those
that
aren't
so
"good,"
but
his
incredible
background
and
education
at
west
point
and
all
of
the
things
he
did.
i
"said,"
"\"this"
"guy\""
and
i
endorsed
him
and
he
went
like
a
rocket
ship.
"frankly,"
if
he
had
a
little
more
"support,"
he
would
have
won
the
last
time.
this
"time,"
i
hear
you're
"even,"
and
maybe
even
"ahead,"
and
we're
going
to
win
with
john
james.
he's
a
great
"guy,"
but
i'm
going
to
introduce
him
in
a
second.
i'm
running
for
reelection
to
keep
jobs
in
michigan.
we
have
got
a
lot
of
…
last
year
before
the
china
plague
came
"in,"
we
have
the
china
plague.
thank
you
china
very
much.
should
have
never
let
that
happen.
they
should
have
"never,"
ever
let
it
happen.
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
"china,"
but
they
didn't
stop
it
from
coming
out
here
and
coming
into
the
"us,"
in
europe
and
the
rest
of
the
"world,"
188
countries.
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
we're
not
happy
about
it
and
we're
going
to
remember
it.
we're
going
to
remember
"it,"
but
we
had
in
michigan
and
in
the
"country,"
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
"world,"
there
has
never
been
an
economy.
"now,"
we're
building
it
again
and
it's
being
built
fast.
by
the
"way,"
it's
turning
out
to
be
"john,"
a
super
v.
no
more
v.
now
it's
starting
out
to
be
a
super
"v,"
but
to
put
violent
criminals
behind
bars
and
to
ensure
the
future
belongs
to
"america,"
not
to
"china,"
because
if
we
"win,"
america
wins
and
that's
what
it's
about.
if
we
"win,"
america
wins.
not
only
does
joe
biden
want
to
eliminate
your
"jobs,"
he
wants
to
eliminate
your
borders.
he's
promised
to
flood
your
state
with
refugees.
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do.
you
see
it
all
the
time.
from
terrorist
hotspots
around
the
"world,"
including
"syria,"
"somalia,"
and
"yemen,"
biden's
pledged
to
have
a
700%
increase.
he
made
this
deal
with
crazy
"bernie,"
a
700%
increase
in
the
flow
of
refugees.
"so,"
he
wants
to
lift
it
up
by
700%.
this
is
in
their
manifesto.
he's
also
pledged
to
terminate
all
national
security
travel
"bans,"
overwhelming
your
state
with
poorly
vetted
migrants
from
jihadist
regions.
making
matters
"worse,"
he
would
open
the
flood
gates
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic.
by
the
"way,"
the
"wall,"
it's
over
311
miles
long
right
now
doing
very
well.
doing
very
well.
make
the
mic
"louder,"
the
mic
louder.
biden
is
waging
war
against
the
american
middle
class.
i
think
most
of
you
are
not
middle
class.
you're
upper
class.
you're
the
elite.
you
know
the
way
they
talk
about
the
"elite,"
the
"elite,"
they're
really
elite.
i
see
them.
they're
not
elite.
you're
the
elite.
the
elite
has
decided.
"boy,"
have
we
hurt
the
"elite,"
haven't
we
now?
you're
the
super
elite.
the
left
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
so
they
can
come
after
you.
it's
very
simple.
over
the
last
three
and
a
half
"years,"
we've
secured
america's
"borders,"
blocked
the
entry
of
foreign
"terrorist,"
fixed
our
disastrous
trade
deals
and
we
have
fixed
our
trade
deals
good.
they
are
good.
in
"fact,"
biden
was
interviewed
today
on
…
there
they
are.
cnn.
"no,"
he
was
just
interviewed
today.
he
was
interviewed
by
jake
tapper
who
i
find
to
be
a
nice
guy.
i
don't
think
he
likes
me
too
"much,"
but
that's
okay.
he
was
interviewed
on
cnn
and
they
"said,"
"\"which"
is
"better,"
nafta
or
the
"usmca?\""
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
the
"usmca.\""
tapper
"goes,"
"\"what?\""
couldn't
believe
it.
he
said
usmca.
he
made
a
mistake.
from
his
"perspective,"
he
made
a
mistake
because
he
doesn't
know
what's
going
on.
even
though
he's
"right,"
he
doesn't
know.
there
were
a
little
surprised
to
hear
that.
they
gave
him
a
few
chances.
let's
ask
that
question
"again,"
but
we
brought
back
our
manufacturing
jobs.
we
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
us
military.
we
obliterated
the
isis
caliphate
and
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
"now,"
we
are
doing
it
again
bigger
and
better
than
ever
before.
before
the
end
of
the
"year,"
we
will
have
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
and
we
will
defeat
the
china
virus.
i
have
a
feeling
…
by
the
"way,"
i
think
the
vaccine
is
going
to
come
very
"soon,"
going
to
come
very
soon.
with
it
or
without
"it,"
we're
rounding
the
turn.
you
see
what's
happening.
you
see
the
numbers
are
plunging.
you
see
how
good
we're
doing
relative
to
other
countries
and
other
parts
of
the
"world,"
but
the
fake
news
doesn't
like
saying
that.
they
don't
like
telling
you
that.
next
"year,"
unless
you
have
somebody
that's
going
to
quadruple
your
"taxes,"
raise
your
"taxes,"
raise
up
all
of
those
regulations
that
we
"cut,"
next
year
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
years
of
the
history
of
our
country.
at
no
time
before
has
there
been
a
clearer
choice
between
two
"parties,"
two
"visions,"
two
"philosophies,"
and
two
agendas
for
the
future.
there's
never
been
a
vision
like
this.
you
have
sleepy
joe
and
you
have
trump.
sleepy
"joe,"
he's
a
beauty.
he's
a
beauty.
he's
a
beauty.
i
watched
the
democrat
"debates,"
right?
i
watched
them
up
there
and
he
was
so
bad.
i
"said,"
"\"there's"
no
way
he
makes
"it.\""
it's
"sad,"
isn't
it?
the
first
lady
actually
came
in
and
one
time
she
watched
it
and
she
"goes,"
and
she's
a
nice
person.
she
meant
this
"really,"
"me,"
i
view
it
differently.
but
she
looked
"at,"
she
watched
the
debate
and
she
watched
joe
and
she
"said,"
"\"darling,"
it's
so
"sad.\""
this
was
early
on.
this
is
the
guy
i'm
running
against.
it's
so
sad.
"darling,"
it's
so
sad.
but
we
got
them.
joe
biden
has
put
forward
the
most
extreme
platform
and
it's
not
him.
he
doesn't
know
what
platform.
he
doesn't.
it's
your
radical
left
people.
it's
aoc
plus
three.
it's
all
these
people.
bernie.
it's
bernie.
it's
"kamala,"
the
most
liberal
person
in
the
us
senate.
i
tell
it
all
the
time.
she
started
off
her
poll
numbers
at
"15,"
"14,"
"12,"
12.
then
she
went
back
up
to
12
and
a
half.
then
there
was
a
big
plunge
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
then
she
dropped
out.
she
dropped
"out,"
but
there's
never
been
anything
like
this.
no
major
party
has
ever
had
a
candidate
that's
so
extreme
in
his
views.
"again,"
he
took
the
manifesto
drawn
up
by
bernie
and
the
super
lips
and
that's
what
he's
going
"by,"
including
a
massive
increase
in
your
taxes
and
a
total
assault
on
your
second
amendment.
on
november
"3rd,"
"michigan,"
you
better
vote
for
me.
i
got
you
so
many
damn
car
plants.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
i'll
be
so
angry
at
you.
i
got
you
a
lot
of
plants.
is
that
right?
i
"mean,"
have
you
seen
how
we're
doing
here?
all
the
plants
that
have
been
"built,"
are
being
built
and
what
about
the
plants
that
are
being
expanded?
they
don't
want
to
give
you
credit
for
that.
they
just
expanded.
i
went
to
prime
minister
abe
of
japan.
i
"say,"
"\"prime"
"minister,"
you
have
to
start
doing
"something.\""
he's
a
great
guy.
he'll
be
retiring
soon.
he's
a
great
"guy,"
the
prime
minister
of
"japan,"
abe.
i
"say,"
"\"shinzō,"
"shinzō,"
you
have
to
do
me
a
favor.
you've
got
to
send
car
plants
over
here.
you're
sending
all
those
cars.
we
stupidly
don't.
now
they've
been
building
it
for
a
number
of
"years,"
but
you
hadn't
had
a
plan
built
in
like
42
years.
they
were
the
old
plants.
and
it's
been
amazing
what's
happened
in
michigan.
but
"honestly,"
it's
been
amazing
what's
happened
in
ohio
and
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
and
florida
and
new
hampshire
and
so
many
other
places.
our
country
is
doing
great.
we
had
to
take
a
pause
to
get
rid
of
the
china
"virus,"
and
we
got
rid
…
we're
coming
around.
we're
coming
around
that
turn.
i'm
telling
"you,"
you
"watch,"
next
"year,"
better
than
last
year.
it's
going
to
be
better
than
last
year.
michigan
will
decide
whether
we
will
quickly
return
to
record
"prosperity,"
or
whether
we'll
allow
sleepy
joe
to
impose
$4
trillion
in
tax
"hikes,"
ban
american
"energy,"
confiscate
your
"guns,"
shut
down
the
"economy,"
and
tell
your
governor
to
open
up
your
state.
it's
all
democrat
governors.
and
i
think
they
do
it
for
political
reasons
because
there'll
be
less
activity.
you'd
be
doing
even
better
if
you
had
a
governor
that
knew
what
the
hell
she
was
doing.
you
got
to
open
it
up
the
state.
and
"also,"
you
have
to
have
a
governor
because
right
now
michigan's
lagging.
great
"football,"
great
"coach,"
great
team.
we
want
a
"governor,"
john
"james,"
that's
going
to
let
michigan
play
big
ten
football
this
year.
you've
been
seeing
a
lot
of
the
other
schools
want
to
open
big
ten
at
my
suggestion.
how
about
sleepy
joe?
he
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
is
against
"football.\""
"no,"
"no,"
no.
i'm
the
one
that
says
open
it
"up,"
let's
play
football.
these
people
practice
disinformation
like
nobody
has
ever
practiced
it.
they're
liars.
i'll
tell
"you,"
they
lie.
but
we
have
a
good
chance.
you
have
a
very
good
"commissioner,"
and
the
commissioner
is
working
"hard,"
and
"hopefully,"
very
soon
they'll
say
you're
going
to
play
football.
and
i
hope
they're
not
leaving
michigan
out
because
it's
never
the
same
if
they
do.
but
you
have
"maryland,"
where
they
have
a
problem
in
terms
of
playing.
and
the
governors
have
a
lot
of
power
over
that.
they
have
a
lot
of
"power,"
a
lot
of
say.
so
let's
play
big
ten
"football,"
right?
they
want
to
shut
down
auto
"production,"
delay
the
vaccine.
they
want
to
destroy
your
suburbs.
look
at
what
i've
done
for
your
suburbs.
you
know
what
i've
done.
you
know
what
i've
done.
does
anybody
want
to
have
somebody
from
antifa
as
a
member
and
as
a
resident
of
your
suburb?
i
don't
think
so
too
much.
"say,"
"\"darling,"
who
moved
in
next
"door?\""
"\"oh,"
it's
a
resident
of
"antifa.\""
"\"no,"
thank
you.
let's
get
out
of
here.
let's
get
the
hell
out
of
"here,"
darling.
let's
leave
our
suburbs.
i
wish
trump
were
president.
he
wouldn't
have
allowed
that
to
"happen.\""
and
that's
exactly
"right,"
i
won't
allow
it
to
happen.
the
suburbs
are
the
american
"dream,"
and
i
will
tell
"you,"
i
have
protected
your
suburbs.
i
got
rid
of
a
regulation
that
played
with
your
zoning
and
played
with
other
"things,"
where
they
force
projects
into
the
suburbs
of
our
great
country.
and
i
got
rid
of
it.
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
can
amend
it
and
make
it
less
"crazy.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
don't
want
to
amend
it.
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
i
want
to
get
rid
of
"it.\""
"\"well,"
"sir,"
why
don't
we
just
do
a
simple
amendment?
it
would
"be\""
…
i
"said,"
"\"i"
want
to
get
rid
of
it.
end
"it.\""
and
we
ended
it.
we
ended
it.
i
think
the
people
living
in
the
suburbs
…
which
i
know
very
well.
i
watched
westchester
in
new
york
where
they
were
doing
things
that
should
never
have
been
"done,"
and
it's
not
going
to
happen
to
our
suburbs.
they
want
to
erase
your
borders
and
indoctrinate
your
children
with
poisonous
anti-american
lies
in
our
schools.
not
going
to
happen.
not
going
to
happen.
for
the
last
four
"years,"
they've
tried
everything
to
stop
"us,"
and
they
are
only
getting
more
desperate
by
the
day.
can
you
imagine
if
on
september
"3rd,"
they
"say,"
"\"ladies"
and
"gentlemen,"
donald
trump
has
been
declared
the
winner.
donald
trump
has
been
"declared\""
…
at
"first,"
they'll
go
crazy.
and
then
they'll
"say,"
"\"okay,"
it's
time
now
to
be
"reasonable.\""
they
will
have
had
it.
they
will
have
had
it.
we
were
coming
together
as
a
nation.
very
interesting.
before
the
plague
came
in
from
"china,"
we
will
coming
together.
it
was
success.
somebody
"said,"
"\"what's"
going
to
bring
you
"together?\""
and
it
was.
we
were
coming
together.
i
was
starting
to
get
calls
from
democrats
that
…
"frankly,"
we
didn't
speak
much.
and
i
was
starting
to
get
"calls,"
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
saw
the
plague
pour
"in,"
and
we
saw
what
was
"happening,"
and
it
really
stopped
things.
but
success
was
getting
"very,"
very
close
to
bringing
us
all
together.
and
then
we
had
to
"say,"
"\"let's"
take
a
time
out.
we
got
to
fix
this
"mess.\""
and
we
"did,"
and
now
we're
coming
back
"strong,"
but
success
brings
us
"together,"
and
it
was
"happening,"
and
then
we
got
that
terrible
situation
"happened,"
and
we'll
never
forget
it.
biden
and
his

tried
to
lock

americans
into
their
homes

they
encourage
rioters

vandals
rampaging
"through,"
in
all
"cases,"
democrat-run
cities.
republican-run
cities
are
doing
very
well.
i
hope
you
know
that.
and
i
hope
you
"know,"
like
in
"minneapolis,"
we
were
asked
to
come
"in,"
we
went
"in,"
we
took
care
of
that
problem
in
"about,"
"what,"
30
minutes?
"unfortunately,"
they
let
almost
two
weeks
go
by.
and
if
you
look
at
what
we
just
did
in
"wisconsin,"
which
was
so
"amazing,"
three
"days,"
and
we
went
in.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
us
marshals
went
in
to
get
the
"killer,"
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
they
got
the
"killer,"
they
got
the
killer.
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
and
we
were
going
to
go
into
seattle.
the
next
"day,"
we're
all
"set,"
all
lined
"up,"
looking
forward
to
it.
we
just
"said,"
"\"we're"
doing
"it.\""
i
"mean,"
they
actually
took
over
a
part
of
the
"city,"
and
the
mayor
"said,"
"\"this"
is
going
to
be
a
summer
of
"love,\""
right?
where
do
these
people
come
from?
but
we
were
all
set
to
go
in
"there,"
heard
we
were
going
"in,"
we
informed
them
we're
going
"in,"
and
they
sent
their
police
to
do
"it,"
and
we
never
even
had
to
go
in.
but
we
can
solve
those
problems
in
a
matter
of
literally
minutes.
thank
you.
don't
say
"that,"
i'll
start
to
"cry,"
and
that
wouldn't
be
good
for
my
image.
you
don't
want
to
see
me
cry.
i'll
start
to
cry.

of
the
fake
news
"broadcasters,"
because
this
happened
the
other
"day,"
we
had
a
tremendous
crowd
like
this.

"mean,"
we
had
a
tremendous
crowd
in
north
carolina.
they
started
"chanting,"
"\"we"
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
"you.\""
and
it's
"incredible,"
they
said
with
all
the
years
that
they've
been
covering
presidential
"elections,"
they've
never
heard
that
chant
"that,"
"\"we"
love
"you.\""
"no,"
it's
very
nice.
"no,"
they've
never
heard
it.

now
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"

18
years
"ago,"

was
a
rally
held
by
"somebody,"

we
heard
the
words
from
two
people
"that,"
‘we
love
"you,"
"sir.'\""
now
this
is
what
we're
dealing
with.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
look
"out,"
there's
a
lot
of
people
that
…
look
at
this.
there's
people
back
there
that
can't
even
get
in.
thank
"you,"
michigan.
thank
you.
it's
really
nice
to
be
with
you.
as
"president,"
i
will
always
support
the
heroes
of

enforcement.
i
was
very
honored
to
receive
the
endorsement
of

are

that's
really
nice.
i'll
tell
you.
that's
an
honor.
i
have
to
be
honest.
i
got
it
from
"florida,"
"texas,"
"ohio,"

…
but
michigan
is
michigan.
thank
you.
i
don't
think
there's
any
law
enforcement
officer
that
is
against
us.
what
is
our
poll
number?
99.
i
know
they
had
"365,000"
at
one
"group,"
and
they
got
a
unanimous
vote.
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
pretty
"good\"."
how
can
you
go
the
other
way?
you
people
are
"fantastic,"

we
love
you.

you.
that's
great.

you
very
much.

at

again.
i
want
to
just
thank
these

were
real

they
love

love

we're
the
party

a
lot
of
different
things

we
weren't
really
considered
the
party

certainly
not
anymore.
remember
"this,"
we're
the
party
of
abraham
lincoln.
a
lot
of
people
forget
that.
honestly.
remember
when
they
used
to
"say,"
"\"he"
doesn't
act
"presidential\"?"
and
i
used
to
"say,"
"\"it's"
so
easy
to
be
"presidential.\""
i'd
only
have
about
10
or
15
people
here.
you'd
be
bored.
but
remember
i
used
to
do
that?
but
i'd
always
"say,"
"\"i"
can
be
more
presidential
than
any
president
in
our
"history,"
except
for
the
possibility
of
abraham
lincoln
when
he
wears
his
"hat.\""
tough
to
beat.
that's
tough
to
"beat,"
john
james.
but
"seriously,"
if
you
want
to
be
well-represented
…
your
current
"senator,"
i
don't
even
know
this
guy.
i
don't
even
know
this
guy.
nobody
does.
they
don't
know
who
he
is.
they
don't
even
know.
he
comes
into
the
"office,"
i
"say,"
"\"who"
is
that
"guy?\""
i
know
every
senator.
"democrat,"
republican.
i
don't
know
this
guy.
i
know
your
other
senator.
i
can
tell
by
her
hair.
she's
got
interesting
hair.
but
that
was
john's
first
crack.
he
learned
a
lot.
and
"frankly,"
and
i
mean
"this,"
if
he
had
more
support
from
the
republican
"party,"
he
would've
won
that
race.
he
would've.
but
this
guy
"peters,"
right?
peters.
i
"say,"
"\"who's"
"peters?\""
nobody
knows
him.
he
doesn't
do
anything.
i
"mean,"
"look,"
we're
going
to
end
"this,"
but
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
john
james
can
be
so
great.
he
loves
our
country.
he's
been
educated
at
the
highest
level.
he
was
always
the
top
at
everything
he's
ever
done.
and
this
is
what
he
has.
and
i'll
be
honest
with
"you,"
john.
i
think
i
can
tell
this
story.
john
and
i
were
thinking
about
john.
i
was
thinking
about
john
more
than
myself
because
i
know
talent.
and
i
"said,"
"\"john,"
you
can
run
for
a
certain
house

and
you're
guaranteed
to
win.
you
can
run

it'll
be
a

you're
going
to
win.
or
you
can
have
a
tough
race
against
somebody
that
nobody
ever
heard
of.
it's
like
a
habit
that
they
press
that
particular
"trigger,"
but
that's
a
tough
race.
so
you
can
be
an
absolute
"congressman,"
or
you
can
take
a
shot
at
this
"one.\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
i
can
do
more
in
the
senate
than
i
can
do
in
the
"house.\""
and
that
was
his
decision.
right?
took
a
lot
of
guts.
so
"john,"
i'm
with
you.
you
have
my
total
and
complete
endorsement.
you
have
everything
i
can
do.
everything
i
can
"do,"
we
will
do
for
you.
and
i
really
believe
you're
going
to
make
it.
you're
running
against
somebody
that
is
just
"ridiculous,"
folks.
it's
ridiculous.
don't
do
it.
also
with
us
are
some
other
great
candidates
and
people
that
are
going
to
do
a
tremendous
"job,"
helping
our
congressman.
paul
junge.
where's
paul
junge?
"paul,"
thank
you.
good
luck.
i
heard
you're
doing
"well,"
paul.
paul
junge.
lisa
mcclain.
lisa?
great
job.
it's
going
well.
and
eric
essahki.
thank
"you,"
eric.
good
luck.
good
luck.
we're
going
to
be
out
here
helping
"you,"
too.
we're
going
to
be
out
here.
i
hope
john
doesn't
even
need
"help,"
but
we're
going
to
help
"john,"
too.
we're
going
to
help
all
of
you.
all
right?
we're
going
to
be
doing
it.
thank
you.
also
with
you
is
rnc
chairwoman.
she
was
the
head
of
the
whole
"state,"
and
she
kept
calling
me
"back,"
back.
"\"sir,"
one
more
"speech,"
you're
going
to
win
"michigan.\""
hadn't
been
won
in
decades.
"\"one"
more
"speech,"
"sir,"
you're
going
to
win
"michigan.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
right.
"ron,"
i'm
coming
in
one
more
"time,"
but
that's
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that"
woman
is
the
most
aggressive
person
i've
ever
"met.\""
she
"said,"
"\"i'm"
telling
"you,"
"sir,"
one
more
"speech.\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
i'll
do
it
one
more
"time,"
but
that's
"it.\""
about
a
day
after
i
got
"back,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
just
got
back
from
michigan.
it
was
"wonderful.\""
i
get
a
call
from
ronna
"mcdaniel,"
and
she
"goes,"
"\"sir,"
could
you
come
in
tomorrow
for
another
"speech?\""
"well,"
whatever
"happens,"
she
is
the
one
that
got
me
here
at
midnight
on
…
she
is.
so
when
it
came
time
to
picking
the
head
of
the
"rnc,"
as
"president,"
you
have
a
couple
of
things
to
say
about
"it,"
right?
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
that
woman
that
kept
getting
me
back
to
michigan?
boy
oh
"boy,"
she'll
be
"great.\""
ronna
mcdaniel.
and
somebody's
doing
a
fantastic
job
and
tells
us
we're
really
pretty
far
ahead.
maybe
way
ahead.
they
had
a
poll.
i
think
it
was
a
gallup
poll.
they
said
62%
of
the
people
are
lying
about
their
poll.
"now,"
they're
only
lying
having
to
do
with
my
…
and
i
don't
know
if
i'm
supposed
to
be
insulted
by
that
or
"not,"
but
we'll
take
it.
but
we
could
have
a
very
big
win.
and
"look,"
no
president
has
done
for
michigan
what
president
trump
has
done
for
michigan.
and
you're
going
to
remember
that.
and
i'm
going
to
remember
michigan.
michigan
gop
chair
laura
cox.
great.
thank
you.
great
job.
great
job.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
"thanks,"
laura.
we
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
horrible
damage
joe
biden
inflicted
over
the
last
47
years.
47
years
of
bad
votes.
after
the
last
administration
nearly
killed
the
us
auto
"industry,"
i
saved
the
us
auto
industry.
joe
biden
supported
the
disastrous
trans-pacific
"partnership,"
which
would
have
been
a
death
sentence
for
american
auto
jobs.
i
withdrew
from
the
tpp
my
first
week
in
office.
that
was
so
easy.
that
was
so
easy.
you
wouldn't
have
been
making
cars.
you
would've
been
buying
cars
from
foreign
lands.
we
have
enough
of
that.
biden
supported
the
horrendous
south
korea
deal
that
would've
wiped
out
us
production
of
the
pickup
"truck,"
which
is
the
most
…
the
pickup
truck
is
the
most
profitable
thing
the
auto
industry
makes.
you
know
why?
we
have
something
called
the
chicken
tax.
does
anyone
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
the
chicken
tax.
it's
a
tariff
of
"25%,"
and
it
keeps
other
countries
out
of
"here,"
and
it
"expired,"
and
south
korea
didn't
want
to
do
"it,"
but
they
did
it.
we
got
it
right
"back,"
and
we
put
it
on
for
a
long
"time,"
and
now
you're
making
…
but
remember
"this,"
go
check
it
out.
the
chicken
tax.
i'll
tell
you
why
someday
at
another
meeting
why
they
call
it
that.
maybe
you
don't
want
to
know
about
it.
but
we're
keeping
those
small
"trucks,"
and
we're
keeping
our
whole
industry
good.
and
we're
expanding
our
autos
"now,"
our
"cars,"
and
we're
doing
a
great
job
of
"it,"
and
i
want
to
thank
everybody.
doing
a
great
job.
and
by
the
"way,"
many
other
things
in
michigan.
biden
supported
the
outrageous
fuel
economy
standards
that
have
hammered
the
auto
"industry,"
and
i
reversed
that
rule.
i
actually
reversed
"it,"
and
it
helped
millions
of
families
be
able
to
afford
a
car.
the
united
states
lost
500
auto
and
auto
parts
factories
under
the
obama-biden
disaster.
before
the
"virus,"
my
administration
added
over
200
new
auto
and
auto
parts
plants.
how
about
200?
i
didn't
know
that.
200.
200.
i
thought
it
was
a
little
less
than
that.
"wait,"
i
want
to
see
that
again.
200.
it's
…
…
than
that.
"wait,"
i
want
to
see
that
"again,"
200.
it
says
200.
do
you
believable
it?
that's
a
lot.
you
"know,"
i
have
a
choice
between
teleprompter
and
freelance.
i
hate
to
"say,"
the
freelance
is
always
a
hell
of
a
lot
"better,"
but
…
if
you
"remember,"
and
you
remember
"well,"
i
actually
got
elected
because
of
freelance.
we
didn't
have
teleprompters.
there
were
no
teleprompters.
but
think
of
"that,"
"200,"
we're
talking
about
200
plants.
i
thought
it
was
a
much
lower
number.
i
thought
you
should
put
me
in
an
office
based
on
a
much
lower
number.
at
"200,"
you
have
no
choice.
"yesterday,"
biden
was
in
michigan.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
better
get
out
of
the
"basement.\""
this
guy
is
starting
to
do
very
well
lying
about
his
lifetime
of
cold
hearted
globalist
betrayals.
biden
championed
"nafta,"
perhaps
the
worst
trade
deal
in
the
history
of
our
country.
he
continued
to
embrace
and
promote
nafta
for
decades.
i
told
"you,"
he
just
said
it
was
not
as
good
as
the
deal
i
made.
i
can't
"believe,"
oh
they're
giving
him
hell
tonight.
they're
giving
him
hell.
what
did
you
say
that
for?
boy
oh
boy.
"yeah,"
hiding.
‘joe
hiden.'
"look,"
this
doesn't
sound
nice.
i'll
say
"it,"
and
they'll
criticize
for
"it,"
you
watch.
but
i
have
the
distinct
pleasure
of
running
against
the
worst
presidential
candidate
in
the
history
of
presidential
politics.
i
really
believe
that.
i
do.
can
you
imagine
if
i
lost
to
him?
i'd
have
to
say
i
lost
to
the
worst
candidate
ever
put
up.
don't
do
that
to
"me,"
michigan.
don't
do
that.
biden
supported
china's
entry
into
the
world
trade
"organization,"
"which,"
by
the
"way,"
was
a
disaster.
china
was
flatlining
for
years
and
years
and
decades
and
it
got
into
this
world
trade
organization
with
all
sorts
of
advantages.
just
a
"terrible,"
terrible
situation
took
place.
that's
when
china
became
a
"big,"
powerful
economic
power.
"but,"
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
just
before
the
"plague,"
"now,"
the
numbers
are
"different,"
we
were
going
"up,"
"up,"
"up,"
we
were
beating
them
like
a
drum.
they
weren't
even
close.
we
were
"gaining,"
"gaining,"
gaining.
we
were
number
one
by
far.
you
"know,"
for
years
i've
heard
that
in
"2019,"
china
was
going
to
surpass
us.
"well,"
in
"2019,"
we
gained
a
lot
on
them.
we
were
doing
great.
we
were
doing
great
and
we'll
be
doing
even
better
next
"year,"
you
watch.
yesterday
it
was
revealed
that
a
fund
partly
owned
by
joe
biden's
"son,"
where's
hunter?
see
his
first
"name,"
i
now
name
…
his
first
name
is
where.
where's
hunter?
he
must
be
a
brilliant
guy
because
with
no
experience
he's
taken
more
money
from
more
countries.
he
had
no
job
and
then
he
became
rich.
but
where's
hunter
who
facilitated
the
sale
of
a
michigan
automotive
company
to
a
leading
chinese
military
defense
contractor?
does
anyone
know
that
china's
military
got
yet
another
piece
of
american
"manufacturing,"
mike
and
the
biden
family
made
a
lot
of
money
on
it.
it
was
a
lot
of
money.
what
about
ukraine?
he
got
"$183,000"
a
"month,"
$3
million
upfront
and
he
had
no
experience
with
"energy,"
working
for
an
energy
"company,"
by
the
way.
what's
your
"experience,"
hunter?
what's
your
experience
with
energy?
"\"i"
don't
have
"any.\""
"\"okay."
we'll
pay
you
"183,000"
a
month
and
i
will
give
you
an
upfront
"payment,"
"hunter,"
of
$3
million.
will
that
be
"satisfactory?\""
he
"goes,"
"\"yes."
i'll
take
"it.\""
would
anybody
here
not
take
that
deal?
anybody?
please
raise
your
head.
this
is
one
"guy,"
"right,"
you
must
be
a
pretty
rich
guy.
if
biden's
"elected,"
china
will
own
america.
washington
vultures
like
biden
and
others
ripped
apart
entire
towns
all
across
your
state.
michigan
lost
half
of
all
manufacturing
jobs
after
the
trade
deals
that
biden
supported.
by
the
"way,"
i
don't
know
if
anybody
…
but
does
anybody
remember
like
12
years
ago?
long
before
i
thought
about
running
for
"president,"
when
i
enjoyed
my
"life,"
i
had
the
greatest
life.
"\"where"
would
we
like
to
go?
let's
go
to
monte-carlo
this
weekend.
let's
"go.\""
"no,"
i
had
a
great
"life,"
but
i
was
honored.
i
was
doing
very
well.
i
was
honored
in
michigan.
does
anybody
know
that?
i
was
given
man
of
the
year
award
by
somebody?
i
came
in
and
i
spent
like
45
minutes
talking
about
how
you've
been
ripped
"off,"
how
all
your
auto
companies
are
leaving
and
going
to
mexico
"and,"
by
the
"way,"
to
canada
too.
but
how
they're
all
leaving
and
going
to
mexico
and
canada.
i
spent
the
whole
time
talking
about
it.
at
the
end
i
felt
"embarrassed,"
i
"said,"
"\"i"
hope
i
haven't
insulted
the
state
too
"much,"
but
why
do
you
let
this
"happen?\""
i
stopped
it.
i
stopped.
it
won't
be
happening.
it
won't
be
happening.
it's
not
going
to
happen
anymore.
biden
took
a
sledgehammer
to
your
state
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
to
michigan
workers
when
we
ended
the
nafta
nightmare
that
everybody
said
was
impossible
to
"end,"
and
when
we
signed
that
brand
new
us-
mexico-canada
agreement
into
law.
the
usmca
includes
powerful
wage
protections
to
keep
auto
manufacturing
jobs
right
here
in
michigan.
now
they
have
a
tremendous
disincentive
to
leave
"michigan,"
fire
all
of
our
"workers,"
go
to
mexico
or
"canada,"
make
the
car
or
the
"product,"
send
it
in
here
without
tariffs.
we
end
up
with
closed
"factories,"
no
job
and
no
taxes.
that's
not
happening
anymore.
that's
not
happening
anymore.
but
do
you
remember
how
bad
it
was
just
before
i
took
office?
it
was
like
an
avalanche
of
companies
leaving
our
country.
i
also
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
rampant
theft
of
michigan
jobs.
biden
has
vowed
to
remove
these
tariffs
and
allow
china
to
resume
its
pillaging.
just
so
you
"know,"
china's
paying
us
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
a
month.
before
"me,"
china
never
paid
anything.
they
didn't
pay
us
25
cents.
you
know
what
i
did
with
some
of
that
money?
i
gave
it
to
our
farmers.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
a
"lot,"
do
we
have
farmers
here?
we
have
farmers.
raise
your
hands
farmers.
that's
not
bad
"no,"
i
gave
$28
billion
to
our
farmers
because
they
were
targeted
by
china.
they
were
targeted.
they
"said,"
"\"you"
know
"…\""
and
that's
what
they
did
in
the
past
to
other
presidents.
they
"said,"
"\"if"
you
do
"this,"
we're
going
to
stop
doing
business
with
your
farmers
and
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
any
votes
and
you're
going
to
lose
the
midwest
and
all
of
"that.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
what?
i
"do,"
whatever
you
"want.\""
then
i
went
to
sonny
"perdue,"
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
a
great
"guy,"
i
"said,"
"sonny,"
"\"how"
much
are
they
being
targeted
"for?\""
"\"sir,"
$12
billion
the
first
"year,"
two
"years,"
three
years
"ago,"
and
then
16
"billion,"
a
total
of
28
"billion.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
okay.
we're
putting
tariffs
on
everything
they
send
into
our
"country,"
"25%.\""
was
going
to
raise
it
to
50%.
"also,"
10%
at
"12%,"
all
different
tariffs.
we
took
in
billions
and
"billions,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
what
we're
going
to
do?
we're
going
to
"take,"
of
"that,"
the
12
and
the
"16,"
$28
billion
and
we're
going
to
give
it
to
our
farmers
who
were
"targeted,\""
and
our
farmers
are
doing
great.
that's
what
we
did.
do
you
think
joe
biden
would
do
that?
he
wouldn't
have
a
clue.
hillary
wouldn't
have
had
a
clue.
crazy
bernie
wouldn't
"have,"
nobody
would
add
a
clue
on
that
one.
by
the
"way,"
we
had
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
left
over.
you
know
what
i
did
with
that?
we
gave
it
to
the
us
"treasury,"
right
smack
into
the
heart
of
the
us
treasury.
and
we're
still
getting
those
big
tariffs.
even
though
we
made
a
trade
deal
with
china.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
you
got
to
leave
the
tariffs
"on.\""
a
lot
of
people
didn't
know
it.
schumer
"went,"
"\"well,"
i
don't
like
to
do
"…\""
first
of
"all,"
he
didn't
like
"tariffs,"
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
loves
it.
but
when
i
made
the
deal
with
"china,"
i
left
the
tariffs
on
25%
and
some
different
amounts.
when
i
left
tariffs
largely
on
and
nobody
could
believe
it.
i
said
to
"schumer,"
"\"what"
do
you
think
of
the
"deal?\""
"\"i"
don't
like
it
because
you
got
rid
of
the
"tariffs.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
left
the
tariffs
"on.\""
this
is
what
it
is.
no
matter
how
you
do
"it,"
no
matter
how
good
the
"deal,"
they'll
"say,"
"\"it's"
no
"good,\""
because
they
don't
love
the
country.
they
don't
love
the
country.
remember
that.
joe
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
china.
my
agenda
is
made
in
the
usa.
that's
a
nice
plane.
somebody
said
to
"me,"
"\"your"
plane's
just
as
nice
as
"that.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
it's
not.
that's
air
force
one.
that's
the
"nicest.\""
"always,"
that's
the
nicest.
i
also
authorize
millions
of
dollars
to
save
michigan
soo
"locks,"
and
forget
all
the
problems
they
had.
for
years
and
"years,"
they
fought
over
the
money
to
do
it.
we
got
$300
million
to
the
great
lakes
restoration
"initiative,"
and
we
have
done
a
job
on
the
soo
locks.
they
were
rotting
you.
weren't
going
to
have
anything
come
through
the
soo
locks.
it's
all
done.
that
deal
is
all
done.
it's
all
done.
right?
thank
you.
thank
you.
where
are
my
guys
there?
good
job.
right.
even
though
you're
law
"enforcement,"
that's
a
good
"job,"
right?
two
months
"ago,"
i
also
issued
a
major
disaster
declaration
in
response
to
the
catastrophic
flooding
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
edenville
dam.
where
are
the
people
from
edenville?
"yeah,"
good.
"no,"
that
was
a
terrible
thing
and
they're
working
very
hard
right
now.
we're
providing
more
than
$43
million
in
federal
funds
to
help
"homeowners,"
businesses
and
communities
in
central
michigan
to
recover
from
that
catastrophe.
thank
you.
perhaps
in
no
area
have
our
opponents
more
thoroughly
betrayed
working
families
of
all
backgrounds
than
on
the
subject
of
immigration.
under
my
"administration,"
we've
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
we've
ended
catch
and
"release,"
stopped
asylum
"fraud,"
and
we've
deported
over
"20,000"
vicious
gang
members
and
over
a
half
a
million
criminal
illegal
aliens.
as
i
"said,"
we've
already
built
over
310
miles
of
border
wall.
it's
all
going
to
be
finished
very
quickly.
we're
averaging
about
10
"new,"
brand
"new,"
beautiful
miles
every
single
week.
it'll
be
finished
very
short.
we've
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military.
all
made
in
the
"usa,"
by
the
way.
all
made
in
the
usa.
you
"know,"
with
the
fake
news
"today,"
i
"said,"
"\"and"
we
have
systems
and
missiles
and
rockets
and
military
and
tech.
we
have
systems
that
you've
never
even
seen
before.
president
xi
has
nothing
like
it.
putin
has
nothing
like
it.
nobody
has
anything
like
what
we
"have.\""
they
"said,"
"\"is"
he
giving
away
military
"information?\""
"no,"
i'm
"saying,"
"\"we"
have
the
greatest
weapons
in
the
"world.\""
that's
what
i'm
saying.
they
"said,"
"\"he"
may
be
giving
away
classified
"information.\""
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
these
people
are
sick.
never
speak
well
about
our
technology
because
you're
giving
away
classified
information.
"now,"
i
just
want
to
let
people
"know,"
we
have
the
greatest
"systems,"
the
greatest
equipment
and
the
greatest
people
anywhere
in
the
world.
there's
nobody
like
the
us
military.
we
have
the
most
powerful
military
in
the
world.
when
i
took
it
"over,"
it
was
depleted.
it
was
in
trouble
and
was
exhausted
from
these
"ridiculous,"
endless
wars
that
lasts
19
and
20
"years,"
and
you
"know,"
those
soldiers
are
starting
to
come
home
very
big.
you
know
that
right?.
we
passed
the
mission
"act,"
we
call
it
va
choice
and
va
accountability.
we
hold
people
accountable
if
they
don't
treat
our
vets
"good,"
you're
fired.
get
out.
you're
fine.
we
did
more
in
47
months
than
sleepy
joe
biden
did
in
47
years.
that's
true.
we
did
more.
that
sort
of
has
a
nice
ring
to
it.
right?
think
of
it.
we
did
more
and
it's
true.
just
take
a
"look,"
space
"force,"
by
"itself,"
that
would
be
a
major
"achievement,"
and
with
"us,"
we
did
so
many
"things,"
so
many
things.
but
we
did
more
in
47
months
than
he
did
in
47
years.
it's
true.
it's
true.
a
lot
of
what
i
did
is
destroy
some
of
the
horrible
things
that
they
"did,"
including
regulations
all
over
the
place.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
we
paid
$150
"billion,"
1.8
billion
in
cash.
we
ought
to
speak
to
law
enforcement
about
that.
how
do
we
send
1.8
billion
in
cash?
in
cash?
you
guys
ought
to
take
a
look
at
that
please.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
every
president
said
they
were
going
to
do
that
and
none
of
them
did
"it,"
for
decades
and
"decades,"
they
all
said.
i
tell
this
"story,"
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
get
done.
it
was
easy
to
talk
about
in
the
"campaign,"
"\"we're"
going
to
open
up
the
embassy
in
jerusalem.
we're
going
to
make
it.
it
becomes
automatically
the
capital
of
"israel.\""
everybody
said
it
for
"very,"
very
many
"decades,"
for
"decades,"
many
presidents.
but
i
realize
now
why
it
was
an
effort
because
as
soon
as
i
got
"in,"
i
was
lobbied
by
"everybody,"
"\"please"
don't
do
it.
don't
do
it.
don't
make
the
capital
of
israel
jerusalem.
don't
move
your
"embassy.\""
so
went
on
and
on.
then
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
do
it
"anyway.\""
it's
true.
and
the
word
got
out.
the
word
got
out
that
i
was
going
to
do
"it,"
and
i
was
called
by
every
king
and
every
queen
and
every
prime
minister
and
every
…
everybody
was
calling
"me,"
"\"please"
"sir,"
don't
do
it.
"please.\""
so
i
did
what
we
sometimes
will
do
in
"business,"
i
told
them
…
when
a
king
"calls,"
when
somebody
"calls,"
an
"emir,"
when
somebody
"calls,"
tell
"them,"
"\"i'll"
call
them
back
in
a
few
days.
i'm
"sorry,"
sir.
he
won't
be
able
to
speak
right
"now,"
he'll
call
you
back
on
wednesday.
okay.
thank
you
very
much.
i
appreciate
"it.\""
on
"tuesday,"
i
announced
that
i'm
doing
it.
then
i
got
on
the
phone
with
18
different
companies.
i
"go,"
"\"hey,"
how
you
doing?
you
"called,"
i'm
just
returning
your
"call.\""
"\"oh,"
it's
too
"late,"
sir.
we
called
about
israel.
it's
too
"late.\""
i
"said,"
"\"gee,"
i'm
sorry.
i
wish
you
got
to
me
a
little
bit
"sooner.\""
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights
and
we
achieved
the
first
breakthrough
in
middle
east
peace
in
decades.
and
by
the
"way,"
on
"wednesday,"
i
believe
of
next
"week,"
prime
"minister,"
benjamin
"netanyahu,"
and
as
you
"know,"
the
"country,"
a
very
"powerful,"
very
respected
country
with
a
great
"leader,"
the
"uae,"
is
coming
to
the
white
house
and
we're
going
to
sign
an
agreement
that
hasn't
been
signed
in
many
decades.
it's
peace
and
its
recognition
of
israel
and
all
of
the
"things,"
nobody
thought
it
could
be
done.
it's
an
amazing
thing.
i
don't
say
this
out
of
"ego,"
but
i
was
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
prize.
"now,"
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
that's
sort
of
a
big
thing
and
the
networks
and
most
of
the
news
didn't
cover
it.
could
you
imagine?
when
obama
came
to
"office,"
they
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
give
him
the
nobel
peace
"prize.\""
he
actually
"said,"
"\"what"
did
i
do?
i
didn't
do
"anything.\""
he
didn't
do
anything
for
eight
"years,"
frankly.
but
he
"said,"
"\"what"
did
i
"do?\""
they
gave
it
to
them
in
a
matter
of
"weeks,"
right?
weeks.
with
"us,"
we've
done
so
much.
we
have
done
so
much
on
so
many
different
fronts.
remember
north
korea?
remember?
they
were
going
to
be
at
war
with
north
korea.
where's
the
war?
where's
the
war?
where's
the
war?
and
we
have
a
good
relationship
with
kim
jong-un.
who
knows
what
happens?
all
i
know
"is,"
we're
not
in
war
and
that's
okay.
they
"said,"
"\"but"
he
gave
away
so
"much.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
gave
away
"nothing.\""
"\"no,"
he
gave
away
so
"much.\""
when
i
"said,"
"\"what"
did
they
give
"away?\""
you
know
what
they
said?
"\"uh,"
we
don't
"know.\""
i
"said,"
"\"here's"
what
i
gave
"away,"
i
gave
away
"nothing.\""
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
but
you
agreed
to
"meet.\""
"oh,"
i
see.
i
agreed
to
meet.
so
now
they're
"saying,"
"\"i"
agreed
to
"meet,"
it
was
such
a
big
"deal.\""
instead
of
being
in
a
"war,"
i
think
agreeing
to
meet
is
"okay,"
right?
and
we
did.
he's
a
different
kind
of
a
guy
and
he's
a
smart
"guy,"
a
very
smart
guy.
we
get
along.
getting
along
with
foreign
powers
is
not
a
bad
thing.
we're
trying
to
teach
that
to
the
media
and
these
idiots
that
ran
our
government
for
so
many
years.
these
fools.
these
fools.
you
"know,"
you
got
nuclear
"weapons,"
you
got
big
"armies,"
big
"navies,"
"\"he"
gets
along
with
putin.
that's
a
terrible
"thing.\""
"no,"
it's
a
good
thing.
if
i
get
"along,"
that's
good.
he
likes
me.
i
like
him.
not
so
bad.
"\"he"
gets
along
with
kim
"jong-un.\""
…
not
so
bad.
he
gets
along
with
kim
jong-un.
that's
a
terrible
thing.
"no,"
it's
a
good
thing.
i'm
trying
to
convince
him.
it's
okay.
it's
okay
not
to
go
to
war.
it's
really
okay.
he
gets
along
with
president
"xi,"
he
gets
along
with
prime
minister
abe.
he
gets
along
with
a
lot
of
"people,"
and
it's
okay.
that's
a
good
thing.
it's
really
hard.
these
stupid
people
that
have
been
running
this
operation
for
"30,"
40
"years,"
and
they
come
out
against
"me,"
and
all
they
did
was
stick
us
in
these
endless
wars.
we're
fighting
for
sand
and
blood.
sand
and
blood.
"syria,"
what
do
you
get
out
of
it?
you
get
"sand,"
you
get
"blood,"
you
get
"injuries,"
you
get
death.
these
people
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing
and
it's
one
of
the
reasons
i
got
"elected,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
we
don't
like
his
foreign
policy.
and
this
is
said
by
one
of
the
guy's
that
got
us
into
the
war
in
"iraq,"
got
us
into
the
middle
east.
"so,"
it's
…
we're
doing
a
great
job.
we're
doing
a
great
job
for
you.
we're
doing
a
great
job
for
michigan.
just
to
finish
in
the
middle
"east,"
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi.
and
by
the
"way,"
we're
pulling
back
and
we're
doing
everything
so
beautifully.
if
we
do
get
into
"war,"
we
win
the
war.
we
don't
fight
for
nothing.
we
fought
for
nothing.
we
don't
ever
want
to
have
war
but
if
there
is
a
"war,"
nobody's
going
to
even
come
close
to
being
able
to
beat
us.
and
we
won't
be
depleted
from
fighting
in
all
these
ridiculous
locations
all
over
the
globe.
you
people
know
that
a
lot
better
than
the
idiots
in
washington
that
has
represented
us
for
35
years.
we
took
out
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
and
the
mass
murderer
of
american
"troops,"
qasem
soleimani
is
dead.
we
kept
america
out
of
new
wars
and
we're
bringing
our
troops
back
"home,"
and
they're
coming
home
very
rapidly.
you
see
that.
sleepy
joe
biden
voted
for
the
iraq
war.
he
supported
the
defense
sequester
that
gutted
our
"military,"
destroyed
our
"military,"
set
us
back
so
many
years.
i
got
rid
of
it
immediately.
he
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
was
against
it.
everything
he
"did,"
he
was
wrong
on
as
said
by
"gates,"
you
know?
secretary
of
"defense,"
secretary
of
everything.
he
was
sort
of
like
…
he
had
more
jobs
than
any
human
being
i've
ever
seen.
but
he
"said,"
"\"everything,"
everything
that
biden
was
for
was
"wrong.\""
he
opposed
killing
soleimani.
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
isis.
he
was
unable
to
do
anything
with
isis.
as
he
came
to
the
white
house
two
weeks
ago.
and
we
cheered
as
we
looked
at
all
of
the
success
that
we've
had
but
he
really
oversaw
the
rise
of
china
as
a
positive
development.
"remember,"
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
it's
a
positive
development
for
america
and
for
the
"world.\""
he's
been
in
washington
for
47
years
now.
he's
all
of
a
sudden
going
to
change?
he's
going
to
change?
he's
not
going
to
change.
don't
"forget,"
he
was
in
washington
in
his
"primetime,"
which
was
never
considered
"great,"
and
now
it's
no
longer
primetime.
when
i
banned
travel
from
"china,"
biden
called
it
hysterical
and
xenophobic.
if
we
had
listened
to
"joe,"
hundreds
of
thousands
more
americans
would
have
died
from
the
china
plague.
biden
was
willing
to
sacrifice
american
lives
on
the
altar
of
open
borders.
and
now
joe
biden
is
once
again
hurting
innocent
people
with
his
dangerous
anti-vaccine
conspiracy
"theories,"
putting
millions
of
lives
around
the
world
at
risk.
and
the
only
reason
he's
doing
that
is
he
knows
we're
right
next
to
having
a
vaccine.
"so,"
he
wants
to
belittle
the
vaccine
because
he
doesn't
want
us
to
get
credit
"plant,"
who
converted
their
factory
to
produce
tens
of
thousands
of
"ventilators,"
after
we
invoked
the
defense
production
"act,"
and
they've
done
a
fantastic
job.
not
a
single
american
who
has
needed
a
ventilator
has
been
denied
a
ventilator
any
time
in
our
whole
country.
they
needed
a
"ventilator,"
we
had
nothing.
we
were
"left,"
bare
cupboards.
i
always
say
the
cupboards
were
bare.
we're
delivering
lifesaving
"therapies,"
and
have
achieved
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
anywhere
of
any
country
in
the
world.
europe's
excess
mortality
rate
is
24%
higher
than
the
rate
in
the
united
states.
you
don't
hear
that
from
the
fake
news.
"hey,"
america
will
prevail
over
the
china
"virus,"
as
franklin
delano
roosevelt
"said,"
"\"the"
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
"itself.\""
that's
it.
we're
doing
very
well.
as
the
british
government
advised
the
british
people
in
the
face
of
world
war
"ii,"
"\"keep"
calm
and
carry
"on.\""
that's
what
i
did.
this
whack
job
that
wrote
the
"book,"
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
trump
knew
a
little
"bit.\""
they
wanted
me
to
come
out
and
"scream,"
"\"people"
are
"dying,"
we're
"dying.\""
"no,"
"no,"
we
did
it
just
the
right
way.
we
have
to
be
calm.
we
don't
want
to
be
crazed
lunatics.
we
have
to
lead.
when
hitler
was
"bombing,"
i
don't
know
if
you
know
"this,"
when
hitler
was
bombing
"london,"
"churchill,"
great
"leader,"
would
oftentimes
go
to
a
roof
in
london
and
"speak,"
and
he
always
spoke
with
calmness.
he
"said,"

"no,"
we
did
it
the
right
way

we've
done
a
job
like
nobody.
all
of
those

of

did
a

much
as
possible

they

it
to
carry

we've
done
a
fantastic

i
think
we've
probably
done
the
best

of

you.
under
republican

america
is
stronger
than
ever
before
and
we
are
respected
again.
last
month
you
saw
"it,"
we
smashed
expectations
with
another
"266,000"
jobs
and
unemployment
is
now
more
than
a
50-year
low.
we
have
never
seen
what's
going
on
with
different
groups.
unemployment
is
at
a
position
we've
never
had
anything
like
this.
you
are
so
lucky
i
became
your
president.
i'm
only
kidding.
i
have
to
say
i'm
kidding
because
the
fake
news
back
there
will
take
that.
they'll
take
that
statement
and
they'll
blow
it
up
and
they'll
"say,"
"\"he"
said
they
were
lucky
to
have
him
as
president.
what
a
horrible
thing
to
"say.\""
because
they're
fake.
"anyway,"
here
in
pennsylvania
you
had
the
single
best
year
that
you've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
not
bad.
the
pennsylvania
unemployment
rate
has
reached
an
all
time
record
low.
and
i
hate
to
tell
you
"this,"
when
i
was
campaigning
three
and
a
half
years
"ago,"
i'd
come
"here,"
you
weren't
doing
so
"well,"
folks.
you
weren't
doing
so
well.
wages
were
way
"down,"
unemployment
was
way
up.
it
wasn't
a
pretty
picture.
just
a
few
months
"ago,"
i
visited
the
new
shell
petrochemical
plant
in
beaver
county
at
$6
billion
with
a
"b,"
$6
billion.
it
is
the
largest
investment
in
pennsylvania
history.
we're
ending
decades
of
failed
trade
policies
that
devastated
communities
all
across
the
state.
for
"generations,"
american
manufacturing
was
the
bedrock
of
your
"economy,"
the
bedrock.
remember
the
last
"administration,"
"\""
you
need
a
magic
wand.
it'll
never
come
"back.\""
we
found
the
magic
"wand,"
didn't
we?
then
came
"nafta,"
the
nafta
"disaster,"
i
call
"it,"
one
of
the
worst
trade
deals
in
the
history
of
any
country
and
the
loss
of
one
in
three
pennsylvania
manufacturing
jobs.
your
politicians
always
pledged
to
fix
it.
they'd
talk
about
it
for
years
and
years
and
"decades,"
but
they
never
were
able
to
do
it.
they
came
and
they
went
to
washington
and
they
did
nothing.
but
unlike
those
"politicians,"
i
keep
my
promises.
and
i
love
pennsylvania.
i
went
to
school
in
"pennsylvania,"
you
know
that
right?
i
know
it
well.
and
i'm
thrilled
to
report
that
we
are
on
the
verge
of
ending
the
nafta
catastrophe
once
and
for
all.
congress
will
soon
vote
on
my
new
trade
"deal,"
the
us-mexico-canada
agreement
or
usmca.
after
years
of
"waiting,"
"many,"
many
"years,"
"many,"
many
"decades,"
they've
been
looking
for
"this,"
and
then
we
got
it
done
and
we've
been
waiting
for
a
long
time
for
nancy
pelosi
to
announce
usmca
and
she
did
it
on
the
same
day
that
they
announced
that
they
are
going
to
impeach
the
45th
president
of
the
united
states
and
your
favorite
"president,"
i
think.
and
the
reason
they
announced
it
on
the
same
"day,"
one
hour
"later,"
they
announce
"impeachment,"
a
few
guys
standing
behind
her.
they
announced
the
"impeachment,"
and
then
an
hour
"later,"
she
announced
that
she's
going
to
usmca.
you
know
why?
it's
a
huge
deal
and
it
plays
down
the
impeachment
because
they
are
embarrassed
by
the
"impeachment,"
and
our
poll
numbers
have
gone
through
the
roof
because
of
her
stupid
impeachment.
and
think
of
it
this
way
"also,"
the
silver
lining
of
impeachment
and
this
witch
"hunt,"
that's
the
reason
they
approved
usmca.
so
that's
okay
with
"me,"
because
they
approved
it
and
they're
very
happy
to
have
it.
but
"honestly,"
it's
an
incredible
deal
for
our
country.
took
too
"long,"
it
waited
in
congress
for
too
long
a
time.
incredible
"deal,"
and
replacing
the
"worst,"
nafta.
we've
also
just
reached
a
deal
with
congress
to
invest
a
record
$738
billion
more
into
our
great
military.
when
i
took
"over,"
i
will
tell
"you,"
i
became
president…
think
of
"it,"
almost
three
years
ago.
by
the
"way,"
was
that
the
most
exciting
night
ever?
i'm
just
watching
these
"people,"
that
was
one
of
the
greatest
evenings
in
the
history
of
television
from
a
rating
"standpoint,"
from
an
excitement
"standpoint,"
what
the
hell
would
they
do
without
me
and
you?
they'd
be
gone.
about
a
month
before
i
"ran,"
i
picked
up
a
new
york
"times,"
it
was
like
a
leaflet
that
you
had
out
at
a
grocery
store
and
now
it's
thick.
they've
got
all
their
reporters
covering
"trump,"
"trump,"
trump.
i
can't
imagine
they
won't
endorse
because
without
me
"winning,"
you
know
what
happens?
they
all
go
down
the
tombs
they
"got,"
all
of
"them,"
washington
"post,"
new
york
"times,"
those
very
dishonest
networks.
they
are
very
"dishonest,"
"very,"
very
dishones.
"no,"
they're
very
dishonest
people.
and
i
have
to
say
"this,"
"look,"
and
i
always
have
to
say
"this,"
you
have
some
really
great
journalists
and
you
have
some
honest
"publications,"
but
not
too
many
of
"them,"
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you.
"well,"
you
know
that.
does
anybody
think
the
media
is
honest?
does
anybody
think
they're
totally
corrupted
and
dishonest?
all
right.
the
legislation
will
also
officially
establish
something
that's
so
important
to
me
because
it's
where
it's
at.
and
a
lot
of
people
used
to
smile
and
now
outside
of
the
"wall,"
which
we're
building…
the
wall
is
going
on.
it
gets
one
of
the
biggest
applause
of
"anything,"
it's
the
sixth
branch
of
the
united
states
armed
"forces,"
the
space
force.
we're
opening
up
the
space
force
because
you
know
"what,"
that's
where
it's
at.
and
everything's
built
right
here
in
the
united
states.
that's
simple.
and
by
the
"way,"
we
build
the
greatest
"weapons,"
the
greatest
"planes,"
the
greatest
"ships,"
we
build
it
in
the
united
"states,"
there's
nobody
that
comes
close.
we
have
the
greatest
military
equipment
anywhere
in
the
"world,"
rockets
and
"missiles,"
no
place
builds
it
like
us.
we
have
the
best
in
the
world
and
we
sell
it
to
allies
and
they
all
want
to
buy
from
the
united
states.
we've
never
had
a
thing
like
this.
we
are
so
hot.
we
are
so
hot.
and
just
a
few
weeks
"ago,"
the

forces
brought
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
to
justice.
thanks
to
the
strength
and
courage
of
our
"warriors,"
and
they're
great
"warriors,"
the
bloodthirsty
savage
known
as
al
baghdadi
is
now
dead.
and
he
was
quickly
replaced
by
his
second-in-command
and
his
second-in-command
is
now
dead.
and
we've
got
our
eye
on
and
our
sights
on
third
"also,"
we
know
exactly
where
and
"when,"
but
it's
becoming
a
very
unpopular
"job,"
not
a
lot
of
takers
and
that's
what
we
want.
go
back
to
living
a
good
normal
life
because
america
is
winning
again.
america
is
winning
again
like
never
before.
and
as
i
always
"say,"
and
i've
already
said
it
twice
"tonight,"
this
country
is
so
respected
and
we
were
not
respected
four
years
"ago,"
we
were
laughed
at.
but
while
we're
delivering
historic
victories
for
the
american
"people,"
the
radical
left
democrats
and
the
failed
washington
establishment
are
trying
to
erase
your
"votes,"
nullify
the
election
and
overthrow
our
democracy.
not
going
to
"happen,"
don't
worry
about
it.
i
wouldn't
lose
too
much
sleep
over
it.
and
i
have
to
say
this
about
the
"republicans,"
the
republicans…
and
you
have
a
lot
of
great
ones
here
"tonight,"
your
congressman.
you
have
a
lot
of
great
"ones,"
these
congressmen
are
great.
the
republicans
have
never
been
so
united
as
they
are
right
"now,"
ever.
the
"house,"
the
"senate,"
we've
never
been
this
united
because
it's
all
a
hoax
and
they
understand
it.
they
also
understand
poll
"numbers,"
but
i'm
sure
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
but
the
impeachment
hoax
is
about
overturning
your
great
2016
"vote,"
or
in
the
"alternative,"
trying
to
win
the
2020
election.
that's
not
going
to
happen.
"yesterday,"
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
released
a
report
detailing
the
"outrageous,"
scandalous
and
unprecedented
abuses
of
power.
get
them
out.
get
her
out.
get
her
out.
get
her
out.
"see,"
these
guys
want
to
be
so
politically
"correct,"
you
get
her
out.
you
see
that?
i'll
tell
"you,"
law
enforcement
is
so
great.
that
particular
guy
wanted
to
be
so
politically
correct.
we
don't
want
to
be
politically
correct.
i
don't
know
who
he
"was,"
he
didn't
do
the
greatest
"job,"
so
they
tried
to
frame
innocent
people
in
the
ludicrous…
it
all
started
with
the
russia
witch
hunt.
then
the
inspector
general
shocking
report
proved
that
the
obama
fbi
obtained
secret
warrants
to
spy
on
my
campaign
based
on
a
phony
foreign
dossier
of
debunk
"smears,"
paid
for
by
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
the
dnc.
the
fbi
failed
to
disclose
the
nature
of
the
political
hit
job
to
the
pfizer
court.
they
hid
"it,"
they
deceived
"it,"
and
they
lied.
the
dossier
was
written
by
a
discredited
foreign
agent
who
"quote,"
"\"desperate"
that
donald
trump
not
get
elected
and
was
passionate
about
him
not
being
the
united
states
"president.\""
what's
this?
"folks,"
they
spied
on
our
"campaign,"
they
spied.
never
happened
before
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
we're
really
wise
to
it.
we're
wise
to
it.
the
inspector
general
found
that
the
fbi
spying
application
contained
17
errors
and
"omissions,"
commonly
known
as
lies
and
deceit.
when
the
fbi…
and
you
have
great
people
in
the
"fbi,"
but
not
in
leadership.
you
have
not
good
people
in
"leadership,"
you
haven't
had.
when
the
fbi
uncovered
evidence
showing
that
we
did
absolutely
nothing
"wrong,"
which
was
right
at
the
"beginning,"
they
hid
that
"exonerating,"
you
know
that?
they
hid
it.
they
hid
it
so
nobody
could
see
"it,"
so
they
could
keep
this
hoax
going
on
for
two
years.
they
knew
right
at
the
beginning
that
it
was
all
a
frame
"up,"
a
set
"up,"
but
they
hid
it
so
that
nobody
could
see
"it,"
so
they
could
keep
it
going
"on,"
thinking
they
were
going
to
hurt
us
politically.
but
now
we're
stronger
politically
than
we
were
ever
before.
and
the
fbi
also
sent
multiple
undercover
human
spies
to
surveil
and
record
people
associated
with
our
campaign.
look
how
they've
hurt
people.
they've
destroyed
the
lives
of
people
that
were
great
"people,"
that
are
still
great
people.
their
lives
have
been
destroyed
by
"scum,"
by
scum.
an
fbi
lawyer
"forged,"
took
an
email…
"forged,"
forged
an
email
used
as
"evidence,"
an
act
which
is
now
the
subject
of
a
criminal
referral.
what
they
did
is
so
unbelievable.
"oh,"
i
look
forward…
i
don't
know.
i
don't
"know,"
keep
away.
i
look
forward
to
bull
durham's
"report,"
that's
the
one
i
look
forward
to.
and
this
report
was
great
by
the
"ig,"
especially
since
he
was
appointed
by
president
barack
hussein
obama.
considering
that
"fact,"
it
was
great
because
we
learned
a
lot
of
things
that
nobody
would
have
found
out
"variously,"
although
i
suspect
we
would
have.
we
also
know
from
a
previous
inspector
general
investigation
that
many
of
these
same
high
ranking
officials
were
consumed
with
anti-
trump
and
anti-trump
people
hatred
and
"bias,"
texting
about
an
insurance
"policy,"
let's
have
an
insurance…
remember?
remember?
peter
strzok
and
his
"lover,"
lisa
page.
remember?
"\"lisa,"
i
love
you
so
much.
"lisa,"
"please,"
lisa
please.
"lisa,"
i've
never
loved
anyone
like
you.
we
won't
allow
this
to
happen
to
our
country.
"lisa,"
please
tell
me
you
love
me.
"lisa,"
i
love
"you.\""
"\"peter,"
i
love
you.
i
love
you
like
i've
never
loved
anyone.
and
if
for
any
reason
she
"loses,"
even
though
she's
a
stone
called
corrupt
"person,"
if
for
any
reason
she
"loses,"
"peter,"
we've
got
to
have
an
insurance
"policy,"
we
have
to
do
it
because
we're
going
to
go…
"\""
and
that's
what's
been
happening
for
the
last
two
and
a
half
years.
it
was
their
phony
insurance
policy.
so
fbi
"lawyer,"
lisa
"page,"
so
in
love
that
she
didn't
know
what
the
hell
was
happening
texted
the
head
of
counter
"intelligence,"
peter
"strzok,"
likewise
so
in
love
he
couldn't
see
straight.
this
poor
"guy,"
did
i
hear
he
needed
a
restraining
order
after
this
whole
thing
to
keep
him
away
from
lisa?
that's
what
i
heard.
i
don't
know
if
it's
true.
the
fake
news
will
never
report
"it,"
but
it
could
be
true.
"no,"
that's
what
i
heard.
i
don't
know.
i
mean
who
could
believe
a
thing
like
that?
"no,"
i
heard
that
peter
strzok
needed
a
restraining
order
to
keep
him
away
from
his
once
lover.
"ah,"
"lisa,"
i
hope
you're
miss
him.
"lisa,"
he'll
never
be
the
same.
but
he
said
he's
not
ever
going
to
become
president
and
strzok
look
"back,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
he
won't.
we'll
stop
it.
we'll
stop
"it.\""
can
you
believe
we
found
these
texts?
this
is
fbi
agents
at
a
high
level.
"\"no,"
no.
we'll
stop
"it.\""
they're
going
to
stop
us
from
winning
an
election
and
then
we
have
to
"listen,"
"\"there"
was
no
bias.
"oh,"
there
was
no
"bias.\""
think
of
these
"people,"
they
write
here
was
no
bias.
and
yet
he
"saying,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
"darling,"
we'll
stop
"it.\""
and
then
they
announce
there
was
no
bias.
now
you
know
what
we're
"doing,"
and
it's
not
"easy,"
and
somebody
said
a
regular
president…
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
normal
because
that's
not
a
nice
normal
refer…
a
regular
president
would
have
been
under
a
"table,"
thumb
in
the
mouth
"saying,"
"\"take"
me
home
"mommy,"
this
is
too
tough
for
"me.\""
it's
true.
"true,"
they
know.
and
while
it
was
tough
on
my
"family,"
i
have
to
"say,"
very
unfair
to
my
"family,"
very
tough
on
my
family.
i
have
a
great
"family,"
tough…
for
"me,"
it's
my
life.
i
do
"it,"
i
do
it.
it's
one
"thing,"
but
very
tough
on
a
family
"thing,"
a
thing
like
this
"happens,"
it's
a
disgrace.
but
day
after
day
we're
exposing
something
called
that
"filthy,"
"disgusting,"
horrible
swamp
and
we're
cleaning
it
up.
and
now
after
and
a
half
years
now
that
the
russia
witch
hunt
is
"dead,"
a
big
fat
disgusting
"fraud,"
the
congressional
democrats
are
pushing
the
impeachment
witch
hunt
having
to
do
with
"ukraine,"
but
that's
already
failing.
you
saw
their
so-called
articles
of
impeachment
"today,"
people
are
saying
they're
not
even
a
crime.
what
happened?
all
of
these
horrible
"things,"
remember?
bribery
and
this
and
that.
where
are
they?
they
send
these
two
things
and
not
even
a
crime.
this
is
the
"lightest,"
weakest
impeachment….
our
country
has
had
actually
many
"impeachments,"
you
recall
judges
and
lots
of…
many
"impeachments,"
but
it
was
on
"today,"
everybody
"said,"
"\"this"
is
impeachment
"light.\""
this
is
the
lightest
impeachment
in
the
history
of
our
country
by
far.
it's
not
even
like
an
impeachment.
these
people
are
stone
cold
crooked.
when
a
guy
like
shifty
"schiff,"
he's
a
corrupt
"politician,"
he
made
up
my
statement
because…
"see,"
i
did
one
thing
very
"good,"
as
soon
as
i
heard
about
this
"deal,"
i
released
my
statement
"immediately,"
but
he
had
already
made
horrible
statements.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
"whistleblower,"
the
whistleblower
defrauded
our
country
because
the
whistleblower
wrote
something
that
was
totally
untrue
and
we
broke
up
the
game.
remember
the
second
whistleblower
was
"coming,"
right?
and
then
the
"informer,"
who
is
the
informer?
i
know
who
the
informer
is.
so
the
informer
obviously
gave
him
a
false
information
because
they
wrote
in
the
whistleblower
"report,"
they
wrote
something
totally
different
from
what
i
"said,"
what
i
said
was
perfect.
but
it
screwed
up
the
whole
works
because
most
guys
would
never
do
that.
they
didn't
even
know
probably
that
we
had
it
"transcribed,"
professionally
"transcribed,"
word
for
word
"transcribed,"
so
beautiful.
am
i
lucky
i
had
it
transcribed?
think
of
that.
think
of
that.
so
when
i
said
release
it…
and
i
don't
like
doing
that
because
you're
releasing
"it,"
it's
a
conversation
with
a
foreign
"leader,"
in
this
"case,"
a
very
fine
"gentlemen,"
president
of
"ukraine,"
the
new
president
of
ukraine.
and
we
call
them
up
and
we
"said,"
"\"would"
it
be
"okay?\""
our
secretary
of
state
made
the
"call,"
"\"would"
it
be
"okay?\""
and
they
didn't
know
what
we
were
talking
"about,"
but
they
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
it's
"okay.\""
and
by
the
"way,"
"he,"
his
foreign
"minister,"
everybody
did
you
know
they
"said,"
"\"there"
was
no
pressure.
he
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
there
was
no
pressure
put
on
"us.\""
that
didn't
stop
anybody
but
we
released
the
conversation
and
that
gummed
it
up.
"now,"
all
of
a
sudden
we
never
heard
from
the
second
whistleblower.
we
never
heard
about
who
the
informer
was.
the
whistleblower
who's
going
to
come
out
"strong,"
he's
disappeared.
where's
the
whistleblower?
he's
disappeared.
he's
gone.
maybe
our
great
congressman
can
find
him.
he's
gone.
maybe
our
great
congressmen
can
find
him.
okay?
but
the
whistleblower
is
gone.
he
flew
the
coop
because
he
reported
"incorrectly,"
and
the
"ig,"
who
didn't
want
to
look
at
the
"conversation,"
he
was
so
anxious
to
turn
the
whistleblower
report
over
to
congress
so
that
congress
could
have
fun
with
"it,"
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself.
but
"today,"
the
house
democrats
announced
these
two
"flimsy,"
"pathetic,"
ridiculous
articles
of
impeachment.
the
house
democrats
are
walking
back
from
everything
they
claimed.
with
today's
"announcement,"
they're
now
admitting
there
was
no
"collusion,"
there
was
no
obstruction
of
"justice,"
and
there
were
no
crimes
whatsoever.
there
are
no
crimes.
it
says
"that,"
there
are
no
crimes.
they're
impeaching
me
and
there
are
no
crimes.
this
has
to
be
a
first
in
history.
they're
impeaching
me.
you
know
why?
because
they
want
to
win
an
election.
and
that's
the
only
way
they
can
do
it.
so
the
democrats
have
"nothing,"
and
they've
turned
the
somber
process
of
impeachment.
and
it
"was,"
you
"know,"
to
"me,"
impeachment
is
a
very
ugly
word.
it's
a
word
i
associate
with
some
very
bad
times
in
our
country.
the
good
news
is
we're
having
the
best
times
in
history
in
our
country.
okay?
but
the
word
"impeachment,"
to
"me,"
is
a
"very,"
very
ugly
word.
it's
a
"dark,"
ugly
word.
"but,"
but
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
as
bad
as
it
"is,"
it
meant
something.
when
you
had
serious
high
crimes
and
"misdemeanors,"
when
you
had
"serious,"
go
"ahead,"
it's
impeachment.
that
would
happen
every
50
"years,"
every
40
"years,"
every
100
years.
this
was
a
big
deal.
they're
making
it
so
"like,"
"\"let's"
do
it
every
six
"months.\""
they've
cheapened
a
process.
they've
cheapened
a
process.
these
people
are
so
"bad,"
the
radical
left
"democrats,"
and
i
actually
think
that
"pelosi,"
who
by
the
"way,"
by
the
"way,"
by
the
"way,"
she
has
totally
lost
control.
she
has
totally
…
it's
being
run
now
by
this
crazy
aoc
plus
three.
aoc
plus
three.
now
it's
being
run
by
other
people.
the
far
left
has
just
grabbed
that
party.
it
is
so
sad
to
see.
and
she
knew
what
would
happen.
i
"didn't,"
because
i
didn't
figure
the
polls
would
go
through
the
roof.
they
went
out
today.
in
"michigan,"
in
"wisconsin,"
in
a
place
called
pennsylvania.
"no,"
no.
the
polls
are
through
the
roof.
they're
called
swing
"states,"
very
important
states.
we
won
pennsylvania
the
last
"time,"
and
we're
going
to
win
it
"again,"
but
even
bigger.
our
polls
have
"gone,"
over
the
last
"month,"
they've
gone
through
the
roof.
you
look
at
"it,"
take
a
look
at
"it,"
it
came
out
today.
the
firehouse
"poll,"
it's
an
important
poll.
it
was
always
good.
i
never
looked
at
it.
"today,"
i
like
it
a
lot.
we're
up
through
…
nobody
can
even
believe
it.
so
what
pelosi
"did,"
and
as
i
"said,"
they
do
the
"impeachment,"
then
right
"away,"
let's
do
"usmca,"
right
on
top
of
it.
you'd
think
she'd
wait
like
a
day.
she
wanted
to
smother
the
impeachment
"crap,"
and
that's
probably
what
she
"did,"
at
least
to
an
extent.
but
any
democrat
that
votes
for
this
sham
will
be
voting
to
sacrifice
their
house
"majority,"
their
"dignity,"
and
their
career.
okay?
and
some
of
these
partisan
lunatics
have
already
said
that
if
they
fail
this
"time,"
think
of
this.
how
about
low
iq
maxine
waters?
how
about
green?
how
about
green?
we've
green.
how
about
"green,"
where
he
"said,"
"\"we"
have
to
impeach
him
because
if
we
don't
impeach
him
we're
not
going
to
win
the
"election.\""
this
is
what
we're
dealing
with.
you
"know,"
we're
dealing
with
some
very
bad
people.
we're
dealing
with
people
that
don't
respect
you.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
know
they
talk
about
the
elite?
you're
the
elite.
they're
not
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
you
got
better
education.
you
got
better
everything.
you're
the
elite.
it
always
bothers
"me,"
they
"said,"
"\"the"
"elite.\""
this
is
the
elite.
look
at
these
people.
how
beautiful.
this
is
the
elite.
you
know
who
are
the
elite?
you
look
at
those
jobs
reports.
we're
the
best
in
history
unemployment
for
african
"americans,"
best
in
history
unemployment
hispanic
"americans,"
best
in
history
unemployment
asian
americans.
you're
the
elite.
you're
the
elite.
but
they
said
they'll
do
it
again
because
this
has
been
a
total
bust.
they'll
do
it
again.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
senate's
been
so
"professional,"
so
"good,"
so
"strong,"
so
solid.
just
like
these
gentlemen
in
the
house.
so
solid.
so
we
have
to
vote
these
crazy
people
the
hell
out
of
office.
and
in
2020
i'm
going
to
work
like
hell
that
we
take
over
the
house.
we
have
to
take
over
the
house.
we
have
to.
right?
got
to
take
over
the
"house,"
mike.
so
here
are
the
facts
that
shifty
schiff
…
is
that
guy
the
worst?
he
comes
up
to
a
"microphone,"
now
he
comes
up
to
a
microphone
like
two
and
a
half
years
"ago,"
"\"i"
have
absolute
proof
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
conspired
with
"russia.\""
russia?
what
the
hell
do
i
have
to
do
with
russia?
by
the
"way,"
russia
wishes
that
hillary
clinton
won.
they
wish.
we
are
now
number
one
in
the
world
in
energy.
russia
is
number
three.
we're
beating
out
russia
and
saudi
arabia.
you'd
have
windmills
all
over
the
place
if
you
had
crooked
hillary.
they'd
be
knocking
out
those
birds
left
and
right.
those
windmills.
"wah,"
"wah,"
wah.
"\"darling,"
i
want
to
watch
television
tonight
and
there's
no
damn
wind.
what
do
i
do?
i
want
to
watch
the
election
results.
"darling,"
there's
no
wind.
the
damn
wind
just
isn't
blowing
like
it
used
to
because
of
global
"warming,"
i
think.
i
think
it's
global
warming.
global
warming.
no
more
"wind,"
no
more
life.
the
ocean
is
going
to
rise
1/8
of
an
inch
within
the
next
250
years.
we're
going
to
be
wiped
"out!\""
"look,"
i
want
clean
air.
i
want
clean
"water,"
crystal
"clean,"
i
"want,"
and
that's
what
we
have
at
a
record
level.
our
air
and
our
water
are
cleaner
now
than
it's
ever
been
with
all
that
we're
"doing,"
and
we
haven't
closed
up
all
of
our
"industry,"
and
we
haven't
closed
up
our
businesses
and
lost
all
those
jobs.
and
right
"now,"
we're
by
far
the
largest
economy
in
the
world.
if
you
"remember,"
you
could
"look,"
if
you
go
back
"five,"
"six,"
seven
"years,"
in
2019
they
say
china
was
going
to
catch
us
as
the
world's
largest
economy.
guess
what?
they're
way
behind.
they're
way
behind.
because
over
the
last
three
"years,"
you
see
the
stock
market
set
131
records
from
the
day.
think
of
that.
and
that
means
"jobs,"
that
means
401ks.
i
have
so
many
people
that
come
up
to
"me,"
"\"thank"
"you,"
sir.
my
wife
is
so
in
love
with
me
because
i
went
up
79%
in
the
401k.
she
thinks
i'm
a
genius.
she
always
thought
i
was
a
total
"stiff,"
a
"dumb,"
stupid
dope.
now
she
thinks
i'm
a
financial
"genius,"
sir.
and
all
i
did
was
buy
some
stock.
i
have
stock
in
a
"401k,"
and
you
made
me
into
a
"genius,"
sir.
she
loves
me
so
much
more
than
she
ever
"did.\""
shows
you
the
power
of
"money,"
right?
isn't
that
terrible?
but
i
have
so
many
"people,"
401ks
are
through
the
"roof,"
your
jobs
are
through
the
"roof,"
we
have
the
lowest
unemployment
rate.
and
"now,"
more
importantly
than
"anything,"
wages
are
up
for
the
first
time
in
"many,"
many
"years,"
"decades,"
decades.
you
remember
four
years
ago
i
was
"here,"
and
i
told
"people,"
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
20
years
"ago,"
people
made
more
money
than
they
made
four
years
"ago.\""
not
now.
not
anymore.
because
people
now
can
not
only
make
a
lot
more
"money,"
if
they
don't
like
their
"job,"
they
go
out
and
they
get
a
different
"job,"
and
they
get
more
"money,"
and
ultimately
they
find
one
that
they
love.
you
have
so
many
opportunities
right
now.
wages
are
"up,"
jobs
are
up.
and
today
we
set
a
new
"record,"
almost
160
million
people
are
working.
we've
never
come
close
to
that
number.
that's
a
hell
of
a
number.
but
just
"quickly,"
here
are
the
facts
on
shifty
schiff.
dishonest
"guy,"
makes
up
my
statements.
he
"said,"
"\"the"
president
of
ukraine
repeatedly
declared
that
there
was
no
"pressure,\""
but
he
didn't
want
to
say
that.
we
"said,"
"\"say"
it.
say
"it,"
you
crooked
"bastard,"
say
it.
but
he
doesn't
want
to
say
it.
we
"said,"
"\"sat"
"it!\""
i'd
like
to
force
him
to
say
it.
he'll
walk
up
to
the
"mic,"
"\"ladies"
and
"gentlemen,\""
guy's
a
total
corrupt
guy.
"listen,"
just
to
finish
"off,"
a
man
who
i
"really,"
i
don't
know
"him,"
but
i
respect
him
because
the
ukrainian
foreign
"minister,"
and
he
said
it
so
"strongly,"
"\"i"
have
never
seen
a
direct
link
between
investigations
and
security
"assistance.\""
he
just
said
that
the
"democrats,"
who
are
"corrupt,"
refuse
to
say
"that,"
and
that's
ultimately
the
only
one
that
"matters,"
the
leaders
of
"ukraine,"
because
they're
the
ones
that
know
of
this
"pressure,"
not
some
crooked
ambassador
that's
a
deep
"stater,"
or
that's
a
"bushy,"
or
that's
a
"clintonite,"
or
that's
a
barack
obama
ambassador.
okay?
the
ones
that
matter
are
the
leadership
of
the
country
that
we're
talking
about.
they
refuse
to
say
it
because
they're
dishonest
people.
there's
only
one
way
to
stop
the
rabid
partisan
"democrats,"
pennsylvania
voters
must
show
up
in
2020
so
we
can
take
back
the
"house,"
hold
the
"senate,"
and
keep
the
white
house.
it's
the
only
way.
only
way.
"okay,"
so
i'm
going
to
ask
these
people
to
come
up
on
this
stage
because
we
have
warriors
with
us
tonight.
we
love
"warriors,"
like
the
guys
that
killed
al-baghdadi.
you
know
how
much
press
i
got?
i
don't
care
about
press.
but
conan
the
dog
got
more
than
i
"did,"
and
that's
okay.
conan
was
almost
"electrocuted,"
he
deserves
it.
they
gave
me
about
a
"day,"
and
that's
"okay,"
because
the
people
"understand,"
we
made
a
great
decision.
and
remember
"this,"
al-baghdadi
was
the
founder
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi
was
a
"vicious,"
ruthless
"person,"
al-baghdadi
created
a
caliphate
bigger
than
the
state
of
ohio.
think
of
"that,"
that's
a
big
caliphate.
and
we
now
have
taken
100%
of
the
"caliphate,"
and
we
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
isis
prisoners.
with
"obama,"
you
did
nothing.
you
did
nothing
but
get
your
ass
kicked.
true.
true.
all
"right,"
we're
joined
tonight
by
many
of
the
terrific
warriors
that
have
helped
me
so
much
in
so
many
ways.
they
fight
for
us.
they
really
are
incredible.
and
they
come
right
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
"hey,"
do
you
ever
notice
where
biden
keeps
saying
he's
in
the
wrong
state?
like
if
he's
in
"ohio,"
"\"it's"
great
to
be
an
iowa
"tonight.\""
if
he's
in
"pennsylvania,"
"\"it's"
wonderful
to
be
in
the
state
of
"delaware.\""
what
is
wrong
with
this
guy?
what's
wrong
with
him?
there's
something
wrong.
okay?
there's
something
wrong.
"no,"
he
keeps
…
how
many
times
can
you
do
that?
so
"far,"
it
could
"happen,"
because
you
know
i
was
doing
six
and
seven
a
day
that
last
"month,"
that
last
beautiful
month
that
i
"loved,"
i
was
doing
six.
i
left
these
guys
alone.
i
didn't
want
to
do
"interviews,"
they
were
a
waste
of
time.
we
just
did
these
big
beautiful
rallies.
and
you
"know,"
if
you
start
getting
a
little
…
you
"know,"
i
went
to
"michigan,"
then
i
went
to
"wisconsin,"
then
i
went
…
i'm
sitting
here
"saying,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
going
on?
these
crowds
are
"incredible.\""
and
we
had
the
biggest
crowds.
by
the
"way,"
to
this
"day,"
there
has
never
"been,"
and
they'll
always
correct
"me,"
in
the
history
of
"politics,"
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
there
has
never
been
anybody
that
drew
crowds
like
we
"draw,"
and
i
don't
have
a
guitar.
i
have
no
guitar.
but
this
has
never
happened.
i
mean
if
you
took
ronald
"reagan,"
and
we
all
like
ronald
"reagan,"
i
liked
"him,"
i
thought
he
was
a
great
"guy,"
but
if
he
came
to
pennsylvania
for
a
"rally,"
if
he
had
"1,000"
people
in
a
ballroom
or
"something,"
you
know?
i
mean
we're
getting
"crowds,"
"25-30,000"
"people,"
and
then
there'll
be
"20,000"
people
outside.
we
set
up
screens
"outside,"
and
if
anybody
would
like
to
stand
in
the
rain
watching.
and
do
you
people
out
"there,"
i'm
"sorry,"
it's
pretty
rough.
but
"no,"
there's
never
been
anything
like
it.
one
instruction
get
me
the
biggest
arena
you
can
get.
we
don't
have
empty
seats.
i
mean
look
at
this.
how
many
seats
is
this?
"11,000?"
how
much?
"10,500,"
it's
packed.
it's
beyond
that.
and
don't
"forget,"
look
at
the
"floor,"
and
then
you
go
out.
"no,"
and
then
you
go
out
and
you
look
"outside,"
and
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
because
there's
a
spirit
for
what
we're
doing.
we're
fixing
our
"country,"
we're
healing
our
country.
we're
making
america
great
again.
so
i
want
to
ask
a
couple
of
our
great
warriors
to
come
forward.

national
committeeman
bob
"asher,"
rnc
co-chairman
tommy
hicks
has
been
"incredible,"
and
my
friend
david
urban.
david.
so
i
just
want
to
"thank,"
this
is
an
amazing
group
of
"people,"
and
with
their
"help,"
and
the
help
of
everyone
"here,"
we
are
going
to
set
records
like
we've
never
set
before.
you
"know,"
i
used
to
"say,"
and
i
sort
of
still
have
to
"say,"
"2016,"
i
don't
know
if
anything
like
that
can
ever
"happen,"
but
i
think
we're
much
better.
all
of
the
things
i
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
cut
taxes.
we're
going
to
cut
regulations.
we're
going
to
take
care
of
our
"vets,\""
look
what
we
did
for
our
"vets,"
with
"choice,"
right?
look
what
we
did.
look
what
we
did.
we
now
have
the
ability
to
fire
all
of
the
bad
people
that
are
in
the
va.
right?
fired
over
"8,000"
people
that
were
disrespecting
our
vets.
they
wouldn't
have
done
it
in
"primetime,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
but
what
we've
done
for
our
"vets,"
what
we've
done
in
rebuilding
our
"military,"
what
we've
done
in
so
many
"ways,"
and
"we,"
unlike
the
"democrats,"
will
protect
your
second
amendment.
okay?
so
we've
done
a
"job,"
and
we're
proud
of
"it,"
and
we
have
tremendous
people.
let's
give
them
a
"hand,"
and
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
everybody.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
folks.
vote
for
these
people.
even
if
you
don't
like
"them,"
vote
for
them.
"oh,"
that's
a
beautiful
new
hat.
look
at
the
hat
that
guy's
got
on.
how's
that
hat
working
out?
is
that
good?
i
love
that
hat.
look
at
this
"guy,"
that
says
keep
america
great.
should
we
do
the
poll?
should
we
do
a
poll?
"okay,"
ready?
so
we
have
the
greatest
phrase
in
the
history
of
"politics,"
make
america
great
again.
wait.
and
we
have
our
new
"phrase,"
because
we've
made
america
great.
i've
told
"you,"
stock
"market,"
we've
rebuilt
our
"military,"
we've
cut
your
taxes
at
a
level
that
nobody
could
even
think
possible.
take
a
look
at
your
median
"income,"
take
a
look
at
what's
happened.
the
"numbers,"
median
household
"income,"
take
a
look
at
your
numbers.
with
president
"bush,"
it
went
up
$400
in
eight
years.
with
president
"obama,"
it
went
up
$975
in
eight
years.
with
president
"trump,"
it
went
up
"5,000,"
but
"whoa,"
"whoa,"
"whoa,"
in
less
than
three
years.
that's
a
big
thing.
wait.
and
then
when
you
add
energy
"savings,"
and
you
add
tax
"savings,"
you
have
almost
a
"$10,000"
gain
in
three
years.
that's
a
big
difference.
and
that's
one
of
the
very
big
reasons
why
"our,"
i
think
that
and
"regulations,"
but
that's
one
of
the
very
big
reasons
why
our
economy
is
doing
so
"well,"
because
they
talk
about
our
consumer
is
loaded
with
money.
thank
you
very
"much,"
mr.
"president,"
i
appreciate
it.
but
with
the
help
of
everyone
"here,"
we
have
now
the
hottest
economy.
you
know
when
i
meet
"dictators,"
and
"presidents,"
and
"kings,"
and
"queens,"
and
prime
"ministers,"
they
all
come
into
that
beautiful
oval
office.
so
"beautiful,"
right?
so
respected.
and
the
first
thing
they
almost
always
"say,"
"\"sir,"
congratulations
on
your

cost
$52
trillion.
that's
more
money
than
we
take
in
in
one
"year,"
two
"years,"
three
"years,"
four
"years,"
five
"years,"
six
"years,"
about
seven
years.
that's
for
one
year.
$52
trillion.
and
you
don't
have
your
doctor.
i
"mean,"
the
whole…
"well,"
she's
starting
to
crash
again.
i
thought
i
knocked
her
down.
i
did
that
"heavy,"
heavy
pocahontas
deal.
i
give
her
credit.
i
thought
she
was
left
for…
i
"mean,"
there
were
just
little
"embers,"
and
then
she
rose.
she
"rose,"
then
she
became
strong.
but
then
she
opened
that
fresh
mouth
of
hers
and
it
stopped.
it
stopped.
i
don't
see
her
as
a
threat.
i
don't
think
she
makes
it.
i
"mean,"
you
don't
know.
crazy
things
are
happening
in
the
democrat
party.
it
used
to
be
a
sane
party.
now
it's
an
insane
party.
so
you
don't
know.
but
they're
all
looking
at
the
same
thing.
i
"mean,"
you
have
alfred
e.
neuman
who's
"running,"
who's
this
guy.
this
guy
buttigieg.
buttigieg.
can
you
believe
he's
doing
well?
he's
like
the
leading
fundraiser.
i
dream
about
him.
it's
true.
"no,"
buttigieg.
but
i'm
not
going
too
far
with
any
of
these
people
because
i
thought
i
was
way
too
early
with
elizabeth
warren.
we
destroyed
her
too
fast.
so
she
came
back.
but
she's
going
back
down
again.
did
anybody
see
her
beer
deal
where
she
"said,"
"\"darling.\""
did
you
ever
see
that
deal?
darling.
it's
about
her
husband.
"darling,"
it's
great
to
see
you.
what
are
you
doing
here?
it's
"like,"
"\"that's"
her
"husband,"
he's
supposed
to
be
living
in
the
house.
you're
"here.\""
i
don't
think
she's
seen
him
in
10
years.
"hey,"
i
have
an
idea.
can
i
get
a
beer?
let's
get
a
beer.
she
wants
to
be
one
of
the
group.
"hey,"
let's
get
a
beer.
did
you
ever
see
such
a
"phony,"
disgusting
deal?
republicans
will
defend
your
sacred
right
to
choose
the
"doctor,"
and
you
can
choose
your
"plan,"
and
you
choose
the
plan
that's
right
for
you.
we
will
strongly
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
we
will
also
protect
your
right
to
get
the
physician
that
you
want.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
this
character
in
virginia.
did
you
see
the
virginia
governor?
i
"mean,"
he
gave
a
whole
expose.
the
baby
is
"born,"
and
then
"basically,"
they
start
talking
to
the
mother.
the
baby
is
born.
and
there's
no
other
word.
if
the
mother
decides
"no,"
then
they
execute
the
baby.
okay?
he's
the
governor
of
virginia
and
why
the
republicans
aren't
going
to
win
virginia
this
next
"election,"
2020.
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
we're
going
to
give
it
a
very
strong
shot.
when
you
have
people
like
"that,"
we're
going
to
give
it
a
very
strong
shot.
but
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
abortion.
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
the
party
of
honest
abe
lincoln.
party
of
abe
lincoln.
i
told
you
about
judges.
i'm
telling
you
about
so
many
other
things.
there's
nobody
that's
ever
done
what
we're
doing.
you
look
at
school
choice
for
every
child
in
america
who
needs
"it,"
including
the
"50,000"
pennsylvania
students
who
your
democrat
governor
has
blocked
from
getting
school
choice
scholarships.
no
scholarships
available.
what's
that
all
about?
how
did
that
happen?
i
withdrew
from
the
"horrible,"
one-sided
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
a
disaster.
i
recognize
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
for
years
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
"america,"
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
people
of
pennsylvania.
you've
never
had
that
better
year.
never
at
stake
in
our
present
battle
is
the
survival
of
the
american
nation
itself.
it's
the
survival.
we
will
destroy
our
country
if
these
people
get
in.
i
say
we've
done
so
much
in
the
first
three
"years,"
will
soon
be
four
years.
all
of
a
sudden
the
time
will
be
up.
but
it's
like
when
you
plant
a
"tree,"
it
needs
time
to
grab
on.
it
needs
time
to
let
it…
it's
got
to
grab.
that's
what
we
need.
we
need
time.
and
we
have
other
things
we're
going
to
do
that
are
incredible.
we
still
have
tremendous
regulation
cutting
that
we
can
do.
we've
cut
more
regulations
than
any
president
in
the
history
of
our
country.
we
did
it
in
less
than
two
and
a
half
years.
two
and
a
half
years.
we
did
it
in
less
than
two
and
a
half
years.
some
had
eight
"years,"
one
had
more
than
eight
years.
more
regulation.
and
we
have
"regulation,"
and
you
need
some
"regulation,"
but
you
don't
need
regulation
that
doesn't
allow
you
to
build
a
simple
road
or
highway.
so
what
we've
done
has
been
incredible.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
our
job
numbers
are
so
good.
if
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
birthright
of
american
liberty
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
and
died
for
to
"secure,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
in
"2020,"
and
we
have
to
get
rid
of
the
democrats
in
the
house
of
representatives.
they
are
stone
cold
crazy.
only
this
way
can
we
save
the
america
we
love
and
clean
up
washington
corruption
once
and
for
all.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
we
have
tremendous
prosperity
going
on
in
our
"country,"
and
the
people
in
this
room
are…
i
"mean,"
you
know
what's
happening.
you
know
what's
happening
with
your
families.
you
know
what's
happening
with
your
jobs.
you've
never
had
a
time
like
this.
they
always
"say,"
"\"are"
you
better
off
now
than
you
were
four
years
"ago?\""
i
"mean,"
who
is
better
off
now?
"everybody,"
i
think.
everybody.
but
"together,"
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
"phrase,"
"\"made"
in
the
"usa.\""
we
just
finished
a
deal
with
south
"korea,"
a
great
new
trade
deal.
we
just
finished
a
$40
billion
deal
with
japan.
we're
in
the
process
of
getting
our
deal
done.
let's
see
what
happens.
they
want
to
make
it
more
than
i
do
with
because
we're
taking
in
a
lot
of
money.
we
haven't
taken
in
money
from
china
"ever,"
and
it's
coming
in
now
by
the
billions.
when
they
target
our
"farmer,"
i
give
our
farmers
that
money
that
they've
been
targeted
and
our
farmers
are
thrilled.
we
have
a
lot
"leftover,"
but
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
"cancer,"
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
we'll
have
that
done
within
10
years.
it
could
have
started.
that
could
have
started
earlier
than
the
beginning
of
our
administration.
we'll
have
that
done
in
less
than
10
years.
think
of
that.
the
aids
epidemic
will
have
ended
in
america
within
less
than
10
years.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
"america,"
one
great
country.
one
america.
we
"support,"
"protect,"
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
bureaucracy
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
"\"in"
god
we
"trust.\""
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
generations
of
pennsylvania
patriots
who
gave
their
"blood,"
"sweat,"
and
tears
for
this
beloved
nation.
pennsylvania's
the
place
where
our
founding
fathers
declared
american
"independence,"
where
the
army
weathered
its
brutal
winter
at
valley
"forge,"
and
where
general
george
washington
led
his
men
across
the
delaware
on
christmas
night.
they
used
the
password.
you
know
what
the
password
was?
victory
or
death.
victory
or
death.
how
incredible
is
that?
victory
or
death.
pennsylvania
is
the
state
that
gave
us
self-made
titans
of
american
"industry,"
from
andrew
carnegie
to
milton

i
love
hershey.

love

the

"coal,"
work

forge
the
steel
that
made
america
into
the
greatest

will
never
ever
happen.

it's
all
over

that
the

here
tonight
have

into

i
don't

he's
right
now
the
hottest

in
the

i
don't
know
what's
going

here.
he
might
even
be

than

right
"now,"
i
have
to
say.
did
you
see
the
scene?
"no,"
he's
all
over

him
on.
they

he's
a
legitimate
great

war

erwin
julian.
"irvin,"
thank
you.
and
i
asked
my

don
to
get
a
couple
of
hats
and
get
some
"things,"
and
give
them
to
erwin
right
now.

how
did

do
tonight?
okay?
he's
good.
good
guy.
and
he
loves
this
country.
so
this
is
truly
an
incredible
time
for
america.
we
have
the
best
"economy,"
the
most
prosperous
country
that
we've
ever
"had,"
and
the
most
powerful
military
anywhere
in
the
world
by
far.
do
you
remember
the
good
time
we
had
a
week
ago
at
the
state
of
the
union?
you
remember
"that,"
right?
and
that
was
my
honor.
but
i
proudly
declared
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
american
comeback.
our
country
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before.
and
after
three
"years,"
of
very
unfair
and
ridiculous
witch
hunts
and
partisan
democrat
crusades…
it
was
the
radical
left's
pathetic
attempts
to
nullify
your
"ballots,"
poison
our
"democracy,"
and
overthrow
our
entire
system
of
government.
but
guess
what?
they
"failed,"
and
our
poll
numbers
are
higher
today
than
they've
ever
been
before.
and
we're
standing
up
to
the
defense
of
our
"constitution,"
our
freedom
and
democracy
itself.
we're
doing
something
that's
never
been
done
in
the
history
of
our
country.
this
movement
has
never
taken
place.
nothing
like
it
ever.
and
the
fake
news
can
attest
to
"it,"
because
if
they
thought
i
was
saying
the
wrong
"thing,"
it'd
be
out
there
immediately.
it'd
be
all
over
the
place.
it'd
be
all
over
the
place.
trump
exaggerates.
that's
terrible
what
he
says.
there
has
never
been
a
movement
like
"this,"
and
it
began
very
early.
it
began
in
2016
with
that
"wonderful,"
beautiful
night.
you
remember
"that,"
right?
that
beautiful
night
in
november.
and
we're
going
to
have
another
beautiful
night
in
november.
this
"time,"
it's
going
to
be
november
3rd.
get
"ready,"
november
3rd.
we're
coming.
we're
coming.
so
we're
having
great
polls.
you're
seeing
the
"polls,"
except
for
some
of
the
fake
ones.
and
if
i
was
treated
fairly…
"meaning,"
if
you
were
treated
fairly
by
the
fake
"news,"
we'd
be
up
20
points
higher
in
the
polls.
there
wouldn't
even
be
a
competitive
election.
"unfortunately,"
it's
probably
going
to
be
competitive.
but
i
actually
think
we're
going
to
win
by
a
"lot,"
just
like
we
did
last
time.
but
i
really
believe
we'd
be
up
20
points.
i
"mean,"
all
they
do
is
"negative,"
"negative,"
phony
stuff.
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
the
impeachment
hoax.
that's
a
hoax.
but
you
"know,"
we
had
great
support
from
the
republican
party
in
the
house.
it
was
197
to
nothing.
and
in
the
"senate,"
it
was
52
and-a-half
to
a
half.
you
know
what
the
half
was?
a
halfwit.
and
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
with
the
"hoaxes,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
border
and
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
religion
and
creed.
by
the
"way,"
they
turned
away
"21,000"
people
"outside,"
so
feel
very
good.
feel
very
good.
we
haven't
had
an
empty
seat.
you
know
what?
we
haven't
had…
true.
we
haven't
had
an
empty
"seat,"
and
this
is
a
tribute
to
all
of
us
because
this
is
a
movement
like
nobody's
ever
seen.
but
we
haven't
had
an
empty
seat
since
your
great…
and
this
is
a
great
first
lady.
came
down
the
escalator
with
me
in
trump
tower
a
long
time
ago.
we
haven't
had
an
empty
seat.
from
our
rural
communities
to
our
inner
"cities,"
we're
expanding
the
blessings
of
america
to
all
of
our
citizens.
we
added
another
"225,000"
new
jobs
last
month
alone.
you
saw
"that,"
the
geniuses.
you
saw
that.
you
saw
that
last
month.
they
were
doing
predictions
on
one
of
the
shows.
what
do
you
think?
"well,"
i
think
"60,000."
what
do
you
think?
i
think
"100,000."
what
do
you
think?
i
think
"84,000."
these
are
the
ones
that
tell
you
all
about
how
to
invest.
what
do
you
think?
and
then
they
came
out
"225,000,"
the
market
goes
up
again.
"225,000."
"225,000."
so
many
manufacturing
jobs.
so
many
that
"frankly,"
we're
never
going
to
come
back.
"remember,"
you
need
a
magic
"wand,"
right?
they
came
back.
and
remember
"this,"
we're
paying
interest.
the
past
administration
didn't
pay
interest.
they
pumped
money
in
like
it
was
candy.
and
we
didn't
pump
money
"in,"
we
took
money
out.
and
not
that
i
was
happy
about
"that,"
because
i
disagree
with
it.
because
"frankly,"
if
we
kept
the
old
practice
which
"frankly,"
some
people
could
dispute
one
way
or
the
"other,"
we
would
have
been
up
in
my
"opinion,"
another
"10,000"
points
in
the
dow.
and
we've
set
144
records
on
the
stock
market
in
three
"years,"
144
records.
144
records.
record
stock
market.
and
you
know
what
that
means?
that
your
401ks
are
up
"60%,"
"70%,"
"80%,"
"90%,"
100%.
guys
come
up
to
me.
he
"said,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
i
just
want
to
thank
you.
my
wife
used
to
look
at
me
like
i
was
a
total
"loser,"
sir.
every
year
we
lost
money
for
years
and
years.
she
said
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
"you,"
henry?
and
this
year
"sir,"
i'm
up
92%.
she
loves
to
me
again.
she
thinks
i'm
a
"genius.\""
92%
401k.
"\"she"
thinks
i'm
a
"genius,"
sir.
she
loves
me
"again.\""
shows
what
money
can
"do,"
right?
but
that
makes…
and
think
of
this.
seven
million
new
jobs
since
we
were
"elected,"
we
were
elected.
and
when
i
took
"over,"
isis
was
all
over
the
place.
and
we
immediately
started.
we
have
destroyed
100%
of
the
isis
caliphate.
we
have
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi
is
dead.
and
we
just
took
out
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
qasem
"soleimani,"
ending
his
evil
reign
of
terror
forever.
and
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to
tell
you
that.
they
don't
want
to
tell
you
that.
they
don't
want
to
tell
you.
in
"fact,"
do
you
remember
the
dog?
great
"dog,"
conan.
when
we
took
"out,"
right?
we
love
conan.
conan's
a
tough
dog.
but
when
we
took
out
"al-baghdadi,"
conan…
remember
this?
conan
got
more
publicity
than
president
trump.
that's
okay.
they
were
looking
for
al-baghdadi
for
16
years.
we
found
him
and
we
took
him
out.
we
killed
another
one
last
week.
the
head
of
al-qaeda.
he
was
"gone,"
dead.
and
america
is
respected
"again,"
respected
like
never
before.
we're
respected
again.
we're
no
longer
the
laughingstock
that
gets
taken
advantage
by
every
"country,"
including
by
the
"way,"
our
"allies,"
who
in
many
cases
take
a
bigger
advantage
than
our
enemies.
i
will
tell
you
that.
they
take
big
"advantage,"
but
not
so
much
anymore.
we're
winning.
we're
winning
like
never
before.
washington
democrats
keep
on
losing
their
minds.
they
hate
the
fact
that
we're
winning.
we're
winning
big.
we're
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
and
that
is
why
millions
of
registered
democrat
voters
are
leaving
their
party
to
join
our
movement.
they're
joining
our
great
republican
party
in
droves.
you
see
it
all
the
time.
i
just
spoke
to
some
of
your
leaders.
he
"said,"
"\"this"
is
unbelievable
what's
happening.
this
is
"unbelievable.\""
you
"know,"
there
have
never
been
rallies
like
that.
sleepy
joe
biden
the
other
day
had
68
people.
and
now
they
have
a
new
member
of
the
"crew,"
mini
mike.
mini
mike.
no
"boxes,"
we
call
him
no
boxes.
and
i
hear
he's
getting
pounded
tonight.
you
"know,"
he's
in
a
debate.
i
hear
they're
pounding
him.
he
spent
$500
million
so
"far,"
and
i
think
he
has
15
points.
it
just
came
out.
hey
fake
"news,"
how
many
points
does
he
have
right
"now,"
15?
they
won't
tell
you
the
truth.
they
won't
tell
you
the
truth.
"msdnc,"
msdnc
is
worse
than
cnn.
they're
owned
by
a
company
called
comcast.
you
can
have
"comcast,"
a
bunch
of
phonies.
but
msdnc
is
worse
than
"cnn,"
and
they're
all
pretty
bad.
you
"know,"
they
just
came
out
with
a
poll.
they
just
came
out
with
a
poll
a
little
while
ago.
mini
mike
was
at
"15,"
and
crazy
bernie
was
at
31.
that's
a
lot.
and
mini
mike
just
spent
$500
million.
but
the
dnc
is
going
to
take
it
away
from
bernie
again.
that's
"okay,"
because
we
don't
care
who
the
hell
it
is.
we're
going
to
win.
we're
going
to
win.
we
have
to.
well
let
me
tell
"you,"
these
crooked
"politicians,"
they
really
took
away
three
years
from
us.
because
despite
the
fact
and
nobody
disputes
"it,"
that
we've
done
more
in
three
years
with
the
tax
cuts
and
regulation
cuts
and
the
military
and
the
choice
and
"everything,"
we've
done
more
than
any
administration
in
history.
we've
done
more.
but
think
of
"it,"
think
of
it.
we
did
it
with
phony
witch
hunts.
we
did
it
with
the
impeachment
hoax
over
our
head
the
whole
time.
we
did
it
under
circumstances
that
should
never
ever
happened
to
another
president
again.
true.
but
with
your
energy
and
enthusiasm
this
"november,"
we're
going
to
take
back
the
"house,"
we're
going
to
hold
the
"senate,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
white
house.
so
we're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
some
of
the
"best,"
greatest.
i
love
them.

"america,"

going
to
speak
in
a
second.
"also,"
i
call
them

because
they
fought
like
hell.
they
worked
with
our
future
speaker
of
the
"house,"
kevin
mccarthy.
but
we
have
some
of
your
great
warriors.
paul

here.
a
"big,"
big
star.
you
know
about
"that,"
doug.
she
became
this
monster
star.
she
looked
with
such
indignation
at
the
other
"side,"
such
"disgust,"
debbie
lesko.
he'll
be
running
some
day.
you
said
your
grandson?
wow.
he'll
be
running
someday.
arizona
senate
"president,"
you
know
who
that
"is,"
right?
karen
fann.
come
"up,"
karen.
arizona
house
"speaker,"
rusty
bowers.
vice
president
of
the
navajo
"nation,"
myron
lizer.
and
arizona
republican
party
state
"chair,"
kelly
ward.
kelly
"ward,"
come
up.
and
we
have
a
lot
of
other
"leaders,"
but
we've
got
to
get
back
to
speaking.
do
me
a
favor
before
i
introduce
a
very
special
"guest,"
i'd
like
to
ask
your
great
governor…
you
"know,"
he
won
like
by
16
points.
it
wasn't
even
a
contest.
you
"know,"
i'm
very
competitive.
i
want
to
beat
him.
will
you
please
get
out
to
the
polls
so
we
can
beat
him?
but
he's
tough
to
beat.
doug
"ducey,"
say
a
couple
of
"words,"
please.
please.
these
are
great
"people,"
great
people.
thank
you
very
much.
so
you
"know,"
before
i
introduce
somebody
very
important
to
all
of
"us,"
to
me…
"also,"
i
have
to
say
with
us
tonight
is
an
arizona
hockey
"great,"
a
friend
of
mine.
he's
a
great
golfer
too.
he's
a
tough
golfer.
i'll
tell
"you,"
he's
tough
to
beat.
he's
tough
as
hell.
and
if
you
beat
him
in
"golf,"
he'll
try
and
beat
you
physically.
he
doesn't
care.
he
was
the
toughest
hockey
player.
he
was
one
of
these
"guys,"
he
could
beat
you
one
way
and
if
he
"couldn't,"
he
just
beat
them
"up,"
right?
he'd
beat
him
up.
and
he's
a
friend
of
mine.
he's
a
great
"guy,"
jeremy
roenik.
where's
jeremy?
where
is
he?
thank
"you,"
jeremy.
he's
a
winner.
we're
also
joined
by
"donald,"
jr.
and
kimberly.
they're
great
"people,"
great.
and
rnc
"co-chairman,"
tommy
hicks.
and
rnc
finance
"chairman,"
also
happens
on
a
team
called
the
chicago
"cubs,"
i
shouldn't
tell
you
that…
todd
ricketts.
so
"finally,"
it's
my
great
honor
to
introduce
a
tremendous
"person,"
a
great
fighter
pilot.
a
lot
of
people
don't
know
that.
she's
a
great
fighter
pilot
and
a
warrior
senate.
she
helped
us
so
much
during
the
impeachment
"hoax,"
she
didn't
wobble
one
"bit,"
martha
mcsally.
you
"know,"
martha's
tough
on
the
border.
and
she's
working
with
me
to
strengthen
our
military
still
"further,"
and
lower
your
prescription
drug
prices.
we're
making
a
lot
of
progress.
but
her
"opponent,"
i
have
to
say
this
"martha,"
a
guy
named
mark
kelly.
even
the
democrats
don't
like
him
much.
he
wants
to
raise
your
"taxes,"
open
your
"borders,"
give
away
free
healthcare
to
illegal
"immigrants,"
and
he
wants
to
obliterate
your
second
amendment.
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it.
the
radical
liberal
democrats
from
california
and
"massachusetts,"
they're
pouring
money
into
kelly's
"campaign,"
because
they
know
that
he's
a
rubber
stamp
for
crying
chuck
"schumer,"
crying
"chuck,"
and
nervous
nancy
wacko
pelosi.
and
we're
going
to
have
a
new
speaker.
but
that's
why
martha
has
my
complete
and
total
support
and
"endorsement,"
and
we
have
to
all
get
out
there
and
make
sure
that
martha
mcsally…
she's
a
warrior.
let
me
tell
"you,"
you
don't
know.
we
don't
know.
people
don't
"know,"
people.
this
one
is
tough
as
"hell,"
and
that's
what
we
need.
martha
mcsally.
thank
you.
we'll
be
back.
thank
you
martha.
"well,"
she's
right.
how
about
that
congressman
al
green?
we
can't
beat
"him,"
so
we
have
to
impeach
him.
how
about
that?
that's
not
what
our…
as
they
call
"them,"
the
founders.
how
many
times
did
you
hear
the
"name,"
the
founders?
that's
not
what
the
founders
had
in
mind.
but
we're
going
to
have
a
"big,"
big
election
victory.
we're
working
to-
but
we're
going
to
have
a
"big,"
big
election
victory.
we're
working
together.
i
don't
think
the
republican
party
has
ever
been
more
unified
than
it
is
right
now.
i
really
don't
believe
so.
so
whatever
you
can
do
for
"martha,"
we
need
her.
it's
been
so
incredible.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
for
"everything,"
martha.
i
appreciate
it.
thank
you.
together
we're
building
the
world's
most
prosperous
economy
and
the
most
inclusive
society
anywhere.
we're
inclusive.
this
is
the
republican
party.
we're
inclusive.
right
here
in…
right?
you
know
that.
right
here
in
"america,"
right
here
in
"arizona,"
we've
created
"240,000"
new
jobs
right
here.
including
over
"60,000"
new
manufacturing
and
construction
jobs
here.
nobody
thought
it
was
possible.
you've
had
the
best
year
that
you've
ever
had.
"arizona,"
you've
had
the
best
"year,"
the
most
successful
year
that
you've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
the
country.
it's
the
best
year
you've
ever
had.
so
i'm
going
to
take
all
the
credit
away
from
your
governor.
i
don't
care.
"no,"
we
have
a
great
team
with
doug
and
everybody
"else,"
but
you've
had
the
greatest
year.
you
know
"that,"
"doug,"
number
one
year
in
the
history
of
your
state.
it's
an
incredible
achievement.
incredible
achievement.
i
don't
"know,"
this
has
to
be
pretty
good
stuff
on
the
debate
stage.
we'll
talk
"about,"
"\"well,"
you
had
the
best…
in
many
"states,"
the
best
year
they've
ever
"had.\""
then
they
"said,"
"\"let's"
get
a
new
"president.\""
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
work
so
easily.
the
country's
had
the
best
year
it's
ever
had.
let's
get
a
new
president.
let's
put
in
crazy
bernie.
let's
go.
crazy
bernie.
unemployment
has
reached
its
slowest
rate
in
over
51
"years,"
half
a
century.
the
average
unemployment
rate
for
my
administration…
think
of
this.
the
"average,"
so
we're
talking
about
now
more
than
three
"years,"
is
the
lowest
for
any
us
president
in
recorded
history.
the
unemployment
rate
among
african
"americans,"
hispanic
"americans,"
and
asian
americans
has
reached
record
"lows,"
lowest
in
history.
african
american
youth
unemployment
has
reached
an
all
time
low
in
the
history
of
our
country.
african
american
and
hispanic
american
poverty
has
plummeted
to
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded.
the
unemployment
rate
for
women
has
reached
the
lowest
level
in
71
years.
soon
to
be
historic.
and
veterans'
unemployment
has
dropped
to
a
record
low.
we're
working
with
our
"veterans,"
we're
taking
care
of
our
veterans
like
nobody's
ever
taken
care
of
our
veterans.
the
unemployment
rate
for
disabled
americans
has
reached
the
lowest
level
in
history.
workers
without
a
high
school
"diploma,"
you
have
a
lot
of
them.
they
left
high
school.
they
"said,"
"\"i"
should
have
"finished.\""
they
left.
they
can't
go
back.
they
left.
we've
achieved
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
without
a
diploma
ever
recorded
in
us
history.
isn't
that
great?
they're
great
numbers.
hispanic
americans
right
"now,"
more
than
"500,000"
own
a
home.
more
than
"500,000"
more
own
a
home.
and
we've
lifted
10
million
people
off
of
the
welfare
rolls.
think
of
that.
10
million
people
have
come
off
of
the
welfare
rolls.
and
happily.
not
that
we
did
anything.
they
have
jobs
and
they
love
them.
they're
making
much
more
money
and
they
love
getting
up
and
going
for
work.
if
they
don't
like
that
"job,"
they
can
get
another
"one,"
because
people
are
starving
to
get
great
employees
right
now.
they're
starving
to
get
great
employees.
since
my
"election,"
the
net
worth
of
the
bottom
half
of
wage
earners
has
increased
by
"47%,"
three
times
faster
than
the
increase
for
the
top
1%.
median
income.
think
of
this.
this
is
such
a
big
deal.
median
household
income
reached
the
highest
level
in
the
history
of
our
country.

trump…
did
you
ever
hear
of
him?
in
only
three
"years,"
including
regulation
cuts
and
tax
cuts…
because
the
other
ones
raise
taxes.
we
cut
taxes
by
the
record
amount.
it
went
to
"$10,"
000
per
family.
a
record.
a
record.
that's
why
our
consumer
right
"now,"
our
"people,"
they're
booming
with
cash.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
our
economy
is
doing
so
much
better.
china
had
the
worst
year
in
the
last
67
years.
asia's
doing
poorly.
europe
is
doing
poorly.
the
united
states
is
doing
great.
we're
doing
the
best
we've
ever
done.
the
best
we've
ever
done.
to
lift
up
forgotten
communities
that
need
"investment,"
and
these
are
really
communities
that
need
it
the
"most,"
we
created
opportunity
zones.
we
worked
with
tim
"scott,"
the
great
senator
from
south
carolina.
his
idea.
he
came
in
and
saw
me.
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
give
it
a
"shot.\""
nothing's
worked
over
the
"years,"
but
this
has
really
worked.
now
jobs
and
investment
are
now
pouring
into
168
newly
designated
opportunity
zones
right
here
in
arizona
alone.
from
apache
to
navajo
and
maricopa
counties.
we're
supporting
working
families
by
fighting
pay.
we
are
doing
a
job
with
paid
family
leave.
we're
doing
something
that
nobody's
ever
done
to
this
extent.
reducing
the
cost
of
childcare
and
giving
40
million
american
families
an
average
of
"$2,200"
in
their
pocket
thanks
to
the
republican
child
tax
credit.
our
historic
regulatory
reduction
campaign
is
restoring
american
liberty
and
cutting
through
"job,"
killing
red
tape
like
nobody
has
ever
cut
regulations
before.
we've
ended
the
war
on
american
"energy,"
lowering
utility
"bills,"
reducing
prices
at
the
"pump,"
and
eliminating
our
reliance
on
hostile
foreign
suppliers.
for
the
first
"time,"
america
is
now
energy
independent.
such
beautiful
words.
energy
independent.
we
fought
wars.
we
did
everything
we
could.
we
used
to
take
the
straits
and
everybody
else
benefited.
we'd
them
clear
so
that
other
countries
could
take
oil
from
the
middle
east
with…
that
nobody
paid
us.
now
they're
starting
to
pay
us
a
lot
of
"money,"
folks.
they
took
advantage
of
us.
but
we
have
everything
we
need
right
now.
we
have
made
such
progress
in
the
last
three
years
with
pipelines.
the
keystone
"pipeline,"
keystone
xl.
i
approved
it.
the
dakota
access
pipeline.
i
approved
it.
"48,000"
jobs.
we're
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
policies.
the
worst
trade
deals
any
human
being
has
ever
seen.
i
"said,"
"\"who"
made
these
"deals?\""
the
"worst,"
stupidest
deals
i've
ever
seen.
they
were
good
for
other
nations.
if
you
like
other
"nations,"
that's
great.
but
we're
now
putting
america
first.
it's
very
simple.
for
"years,"
washington
politicians
took
money
from
"lobbyists,"
global
"corporations,"
and
"really,"
the
most
corrupt
special
interests
anybody's
ever
seen.
to
ship
our
jobs
and
our
factories
to
other
countries.
we
lost
our
"taxes,"
we
lost
our
"workers,"
we
lost
our
"companies,"
and
we
did
nothing
about
it.
now
we've
done
a
lot
about
it
because
companies
are
pouring
back
in.
america
lost
one
in
four
manufacturing
jobs
following
the
twin
disasters
of
"nafta,"
the
worst
deal
ever
"made,"
worst
trade
deal
ever
"made,"
and
one
that
was
almost
as
bad
and
gave
china
an
entrance
into
being
a
rocket
ship
when
they
entered
the
world
"trade,"
wto.
one
of
the
worst
deals
that
we
participated
in
this.
by
the
"way,"
we
just
won
$7.5
billion
in
a
lawsuit
with
wto.
we
weren't
winning
anything.
we
weren't
winning
"anything,"
but
they
"said,"
"\"i"
think
this
guy's
going
to
pull
"out.\""
they
treated
us
so
unfairly.
we
were
always
in
the
minority
position.
i
"mean,"
who
the
hell
negotiated
these
deals?
but
they
look
at
us
and
they
"say,"
"\"look,"
if
we're
not
treated
"fairly,"
we're
"gone.\""
all
of
a
"sudden,"
we're
winning
all
these
cases.
but
we
just
won
7.5
billion.
7.5
billion.
did
you
know
"that,"
doug?
7.5
billion.
but
under
this
"administration,"
the
great
betrayal
is
over.
america's
no
longer
for
sale.
america
is
no
longer
for
sale.
those
days
are
over.
two
generations
of
politicians
came
and
went
promising
to
replace
nafta.
how
many
times
have
you
heard
we're
going
to
replace
nafta?
probably
the
number
one
reason
i
ran
for
office.
are
we
glad
i
ran
for
office?
i
think
so.
it's
"funny,"
i
was
watching
the
different…
i
find
it
fascinating.
i'm
watching
the
different
returns
coming
in
and
i'm
watching
as
much
as
i
can
of
this
stuff.
i
love
it.
we
all
love
it.
if
you
don't
love
"it,"
you're
not
going
to
do
it
very
well.
the
crazy
new
york
"times,"
which
was
a
dead
newspaper
when
i
"ran,"
it
was
dead
as
a
doornail.
a
month
before
i
"ran,"
"doug,"
i
held
up
a
new
york
"times,"
it
was
like
what
you
get
thrown
in
your
face
at
a
supermarket.
it
was
a
thing.
it
just
flew
away.
there
was
nothing.
now
it's
doing
very
well.
but
you
know
what?
someday
we
won't
be
here.
when
we're
"not,"
those
papers
are
in
big
trouble.
but
this
thing
was
a
dead
newspaper.
but
i
was
watching
and
they
had
an
article
this
weekend
about
people
that
spent
their
own
money
and
how
they're
doing.
they
have
mini
mike
has
spent
$411
million.
it's
a
question
"mark,"
how's
he
going
to…
i'll
tell
you
how
he's
going
to
do.
he's
probably
not
going
to
get
the
democratic
nomination.
that's
how
he's
going
to
do.
but
mini
"mike,"
$411.
then
they
had
this
"idiot,"
steyer.
we
call
him
impeachment
steyer.
how
did
that
work
"out,"
steyer?
he's
another
beauty.
the
guy
worked…
he
spent
210
million.
he
got
one-third
of
1%
in
iowa.
in
new
hampshire
he
did
much
better.
he
got
less
than
3%.
guy's
in
there
for
like
250
million.
how
did
it
work
"out,"
steyer?
you
jerk.
i
never
even
heard
of
him.
i
never
even
heard
of
him.
i
turn
on
every
time…
for
"years,"
i'm
turning
on…
impeach
him.
they
don't
even
know
why.
they
never
say
why.
they
don't
have
any
reason.
impeach
the
president.
this
guy
spent
a
fortune
on
this
"stuff,"
so
it
worked
out
pretty
good.
but
"anyway,"
so
then
i
go
and
i
look.
it
has
mini
mike's…
question
marks.
i
can
give
you
the
"answer,"
but
right
now
they
have
to
have
a
question
"mark,"
right?
then
they
go
down
and
they
had
other
people.
some
of
them
i
like.
they
have
ross
"perot,"
who
honestly…
it
was
a
tough
day
for
bush
when
he
joined
the
campaign.
because
clinton
didn't
win.
ross
perot
took
away
19%
of
the
votes.
didn't
clinton
get
41
or
43%?
give
me
a
break.
but
that's
okay.
whatever.
but
they
had
ross
perot
spent
like
100
"million,"
which
is
probably
double
if
you
bring
it
up
to
today's
dollars.
then
they
have
different
people.
a
friend
of
mine
who
"ran,"
steve
"forbes,"
he
ran
twice.
he
was
in
for
a
lot.
then
they
had
donald
trump.
"now,"
this
is
your
own
money.
this
is
your
own
money.
i
said
i'd
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
my
primaries.
we'll
see
how
the
hell
we
do.
it's
amazing.
once
you
"win,"
money
comes
in.
it
comes
in
pretty
fast.
what's
that
all
about?
but
so
in
the
middle
they
had
"trump,"
and
then
they
had
four
or
five
that
were
behind
me.
lot
of
money
spent.
"loss,"
"loss,"
"loss,"
"loss,"
loss.
but
in
the
middle
they
have
donald
trump.
it
didn't
say
500
"million,"
and
it
didn't
say
250
like
this
steyer
guy.
it
didn't
say…
it
said
70
million
of
my
own
money.
i
spent
70.
it
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
won
the
presidency
of
the
united
"states.\""
right?
we
won.
my
father
would
teach
"me,"
if
you
could
spend
less
and
"win,"
that's
better
than
spending
a
lot
and
winning.
crooked
hillary
spent
at
least
three
times
more
than
we
did
and
lost.
crooked
as
hell.
she's
crooked
as
hell.
we
have
a
double-sided
justice.
it's
very
unfair
what's
going
on.
very
unfair.
but
let's
see
how
it
all
works
"out,"
folks.
let's
see
how
it
all
works
out.
i
hope
you're
going
to
be
happy.
i
hope
you're
going
to
be
"happy,"
because
there
are
a
lot
of
dishonest
slimeballs
out
there.
dishonest
scum.
dirty
"cops,"
a
lot
of
dirty
cops.
by
the
"way,"
the
"fbi,"
those
guys
in
that
are
incredible.
but
the
ones
on
"top,"
they
were
absolute
scum.
what
they
were
trying
to
"do,"
if
that
happened
to
"obama,"
or
a
"democrat,"
or
especially
a
liberal
"democrat,"
they'd
be
in
jail
for
50
years
and
it
would
have
taken
place
two
years
ago
already.
they
spied
on
our
campaign.
remember
that.
after
they
"spied,"
we
won.
then
after
we
"won,"
they
tried
to
get
us
out
of
office.
it's
never
happened
before
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
and
we
can't
let
that
happen.
we
can
never
ever
excuse
it.
we
can
never
let
them
get
away
with
that.
never
let
them
get
away
with
it.
but
we
keep
our
promises
that
we
work
hard
and
our
economy
is
great.
the
last
"month,"
we
ended
the
nafta…
"look,"
you
saw
it.
nafta
catastrophe.
that's
what
it
was.
we
ended
that
catastrophe.
"again,"
i
really
ran
because
of
nafta.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
"stupid.\""
all
over
the
place.
in
your
"state,"
but
you
go
to
new
"england,"
empty
"factories,"
empty
buildings.
still
you
have
empty
buildings.
we
lost
so
much.
we
lost
"60,000"
factories
and
plants.
i
signed
that
brand
"new,"
beautiful
us-mexico-canada
agreement
into
law.
the
usmca
is
a
gigantic
victory
for
"farmers,"
and
"ranchers,"
and
manufacturers
all
across
the
great
state
of
arizona.
by
the
"way,"
for
people
with
the
small
farms
and
small
"businesses,"
if
you
love
your
"children,"
you
can
now
leave
your
"companies,"
you
can
leave
your
"farm,"
you
can
leave
your
ranch
to
your
"children,"
and
you
don't
have
to
to
"pay,"
they
don't
pay
a
death
tax.
they
don't
pay
an
inheritance
tax.
a
big
deal.
that's
a
big
deal.
so
if
you
love
your
"children,"
it's
good.
if
you
don't
love
your
"children,"
it
doesn't
matter.
don't
leave
it
to
"them,"
if
you
don't
love.
if
your
children
are
no
good
to
"you,"
don't
give
them
anything.
let
them
go
out
and
work
like
hell.
"no,"
if
you
love…
does
anybody
in
this
incredible
audience…
"man,"
this
is
a
big
building.
does
anybody
not
love
their
children?
anybody?
do
i
have
a
hand?
do
i
have
a…
there's
a
hand.
you've
got
to
be
kidding.
you've
got
to
be
kidding.
so
then
you
don't
care
about
the
tax.
"okay,"
don't
worry
about
it.
he
"says,"
"\"no,"
i
don't
care
about
that
"one.\""
"well,"
that's
good.
you
look
like
a
nice
guy
too.
he's
tough.
you'd
love
to
be
his
"kid,"
wouldn't
you?
but
i
also
took
the
strongest
ever
action
to
confront
china's
massive
theft
of
american
jobs.
our
strategy
worked.
last
"month,"
we
signed
a
groundbreaking
trade
agreement
with
china
that
will
defend
our
"workers,"
protect
our
intellectual
"property,"
and
boost
american
exports.
china
will
invest
$250
billion
a
year
into
the
united
states
and
buy
our
products
and
create
jobs.
nothing
like
that
has
ever
happened
before.
after
years
of
building
up
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
country.
that's
the
way
we
want
it.
we
are
finally
putting
our
country
first.
we
are
putting
america
first.
on
no
issue
have
washington
democrats
more
thoroughly
sold
out
the
american
people
than
immigration.
you
know
it
almost
better
than
anybody.
"anybody,"
doug.
you
know
it
better
than
"anybody,"
what
they've
done
on
your
"border,"
but
we're
stopping
that
border.
that
border
is
"clogged,"
and
we've
started
the
big
wall
right
in
arizona.
we
build
a
lot
of
wall.
that's
a
big
one.
that's
a
big
one.
top
of
the
line.
before
i
came
into
"office,"
the
far
left's
policy
of
open
borders
allowed
deadly
drugs
to
flow
freely
into
our
"country,"
poisoning
our
children.
"including,"
as
you
know
very
well
right
here
in
"arizona,"
washington
democrats
put
the
needs
of
illegal
immigrants
before
the
wellbeing
of
american
citizens.
they
want
to
let
anyone
from
around
the
world
simply
walk
across
the
border.
then
they
want
to
give
them
a
lifetime
of
free
"welfare,"
"healthcare,"
everything.
they
want
to
give
them
everything.
for
a
long
period
of
"time,"
they
were
treated…
you
know
this
before
i
came.
they
were
treated
far
better
than
our
veterans
were
treated.
now
our
veterans
are
treated
great.
true.
illegal
immigration
costs
arizona
taxpayers
more
than
$2
billion
every
year.
two
billion
you're
paying.
nearly
20%
of
arizona's
annual
budget
in
general
funds
goes
toward
this
big
problem.
for
the
amount
of
money
washington
democrats
want
to
spend
supporting
illegal
"immigrants,"
we
could
rebuild
our
cities
all
throughout
"america,"
which
is
what
we
should
be
doing.
under
my
"administration,"
we
are
finally
taking
care
of
our
own
"citizens,"
including
millions
and
millions
of
legal
immigrants
who
follow
our
"laws,"
pay
their
"taxes,"
and
are
entitled
to
a
government
that
protects
their
families
and
their
communities.
every
"day,"
democrats'
open
borders
policies
are
harming
and
killing
innocent
lives.
in
arizona
alone
last
"year,"
ice
officers
arrested
over
"4,500"
criminal
aliens
charged
or
convicted
of
dangerous
offenses
including
"robbery,"
"rape,"
and
murder.
right
here
in
"phoenix,"
an
illegal
alien
chased
a
man
through
a
parking
lot
and
shot
him
in
cold
"blood,"
then
walked
over
to
the
victim
and
shot
him
four
more
times
right
in
the
face
as
he
laid
dying
in
the
street.
this
savage
animal
had
previously
been
deported
after
serving
six
years
in
prison.
he
was
in
prison
six
years.
he
was
there
six
years
and
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
it.
they
want
to
protect
them.
last
year
in
"tucson,"
another
illegal
alien
was
sentenced
to
10
years
for
repeatedly
raping
a
vulnerable
young
woman.
yet
left
wing
politicians
oppose
all
detention
of
illegal
"aliens,"
even
convicted
"criminals,"
and
they
support
deadly
sanctuary
cities
that
release
these
criminal
aliens
directly
into
america's
communities.
"thankfully,"
arizona
has
banned
sanctuary
cities.
with
a
republican
majority
in
"congress,"
we
will
ban
them
in
every
state
in
america.

the
morning.
i
then
went
to
"california,"
made
two
speeches.
i
then
went
someplace
else.
i
"said,"
"\"am"
i
"finished?\""
"no,"
you've
got
to
go
to
arizona
tonight
and
speak
in
front
of
like
"25,000"
people.
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
okay.
that's
"okay.\""
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"okay.\""
"no,"
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"okay,\""
because
i
love
this
unbelievable
energy
in
this
crowd.
but
you
know
what?
"honestly,"
there's
tremendous
energy
in
our
nation.
there's
tremendous
energy
in
our
nation.
greatest
nation
in
the
world.
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
for
eight
straight
months
in
a
"row,"
which
will
soon
be
a
record.
illegal
crossings
are
down
75%
since
last
spring.
the
month
of
january
saw
the
fewest
illegal
border
crossings
in
two
years.
and
we've
ended
catch
and
"release,"
a
horrible
democrat
policy
that
we
got
terminated.
border
"patrol,"
great
"people,"
have
seized
the
largest
amount
of
deadly
narcotics
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
country
this
year.
we've
deported
record
numbers
of
gang
"members,"
including
the
worst
gang
of
"all,"
ms-13.
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
have
been
thrown
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
we've
done
more
to
secure
the
border
than
any
administration
in
history.
we're
building
the
"wall,"
as
i
"said,"
faster
than
ever.
it
will
soon
be
almost
one
new
mile
a
day.
we're
looking
for
that.
washington
democrats
have
never
been
more
"extreme,"
taking
cues
from
crazy
bernie
sanders.
how's
he
doing
tonight?
132
congressional
democrats
have
signed
up
for
bernie's
healthcare
takeover
of
the
world.
think
of
"this,"
180
million
americans
are
going
to
lose
healthcare
coverage
under
this
plan.
but
if
you
don't
"mind,"
i'm
not
going
to
criticize
it
tonight.
let
them
keep
going
and
i'll
start
talking
about
it
about
two
weeks
out
from
the
election.
okay?
because
i
don't
want
him
to
change.
please
don't
change.
same
with
the
green
new
deal.
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
"it,"
"doug,"
tonight.
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
i
came
up
with
the
name
pocahontas.
too
early.
but
"fortunately,"
she's
self-destructed
anyway.
did
you
ever
see
a
phony
like
that?
she's
a
phony.
she
lost
because
she
couldn't
keep
it
straight
on
her
own
heritage.
she
said
she
was
an
indian.
i
"said,"
"\""
i
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
you
"have,"
and
i
have
"none.\""
she
"said,"
"\"oh,\""
and
she
panicked.
she
"panicked,"
and
she
had
a
test.
you
know
the
"result,"
1/124th.
i
think
i
win
the
bet.
somewhere
along
the
"line,"
i
think
i
win.
"no,"
she…
i
did
it
too
early.
i
would
have
saved
"it,"
but
i
guess
it
was
effective.
she's
essentially
"gone-zo,"
so…
one
of
those
things.
while
the
socialist
democrats
are
try-
…
one
of
those
things.
while
the
socialist
democrats
are
trying
to
destroy
american
healthcare
and
your
social
"security,"
my
administration
is
protecting
your
social
"security,"
your
"medicare,"
and
is
fighting
to
give
you
great
healthcare.
and
that's
what
we're
getting.
that's
right.
one
of
the
big
secrets.
the
democrats
won't
let
us
say
it.
they
want
to
keep
that
as
quiet
as
possible.
look
what
they
gave
"you,"
the
worst
healthcare.
and
what
we've
"done,"
we've
gotten
rid
of
things
that
nobody
could
believe
that
was
so
bad
for
you.
everybody
was
happy
with
defending
your
right
to
keep
your
doctor
and
plan
of
your
choice.
we're
making
healthcare
better
and
"much,"
much
cheaper
while
premiums
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
five
years
before
i
took
"office,"
we
are
now
offering
plans
that
are
up
to
60%
less
expensive
than
they
"were,"
and
it's
better
healthcare.
a
lot
of
people
don't
know
this.
people
don't
know
this.
they
think
that's
their
issue.
it's
not.
they
failed
on
healthcare.
we're
protecting
people
with
preexisting
"conditions,"
and
we
always
will.
and
by
the
"way,"
we're
trying
to
get
rid
of
"obamacare,"
but
we're
managing
it
"incredibly,"
but
we're
trying
to
get
rid
so
we
can
give
you
a
great
healthcare
plan
and
protect
preexisting
conditions.
remember
that.
we're
trying
to
get
rid
of
"it,"
but
while
we're
having
"it,"
we're
managing
it
really
much
better
than
they
did.
remember
they
built
the
$5
billion
website?
remember
that?
it
was
supposed
to
cost
$5
million.
it
cost
$5
billion.
$5
billion.
i
"mean,"
you
could
get
a
kid
out
of
high
school.
i
have
a
son.
he's
a
young
"boy,"
13.
he
uses
a
computer.
he
could
have
given
them
a
healthcare
site.
i
would
say
he
would
have
charged
them
"$100,"
barron
"trump,"
and
it
would've
worked.
he's
so
good.
"\"hi"
dad.
how
you
"doing,"
dad?
how's
it
"going?\""
"bing,"
"bing,"
bong.
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
play
with
that
while
you're
talking
to
"me.\""
"\"what's"
going
"on,"
"dad?\""
these
kids
are
"incredible,"
right?
the
"kids,"
they
make
us
look
like
babies
with
that.
but
he
could
have
given
you
a
great
site
for
about
$2.
they
spent
$5
billion
on
a
site
that
never
worked.
by
the
"way,"
speaking
of
"that,"
how
did
they
do
with
their
vote
count
in
iowa?
and
i
"hear,"
i
"hear,"
i
don't
want
to
say
it.
i
don't
want
to
jinx
them
"because,"
of
"course,"
i
want
them
to
do
"well,"
but
i
do.
we
don't
have
anything.
nobody's
running
against
us
in
so
many
states.
it's
sort
of
nice.
we
can
save
the
"thunder,"
right?
but
i
hear
that
in
nevada.
i'm
hearing
bad
things
about
their
vote
count.
i
hear
a
lot
of
bad
things
are
"happening,"
like
they
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing.
i
turned
on
the
other
"night,"
"iowa,"
i
wanted
to
see
…
and
by
the
"way,"
we
set
a
record
in
the
history
of
iowa.
we
had
more
votes
than
anybody's
ever
had
as
an
incumbent
president.
same
thing
in
new
hampshire.
it's
a
good
sign.
it's
a
good
sign.
by
a
lot.
by
the
"way,"
by
a
lot.
but
i'm
hearing
"that,"
and
i
hope
this
isn't
the
case
because
i'd
like
to
find
out
who
the
hell
won.
we
still
don't
know
who
won
in
iowa.
i
heard
coming
over
here
they're
still
working
on
the
count.
"no,"
"no,"
no.
he
"said,"
"\"you"
"won.\""
"yeah,"
i
think
we
did
win.
i
think
we
did.
very
good.
that's
very
good.
i
have
to
thank
"you,"
that
one.
that's
very
good.
"no,"
we
did
win.
"look,"
we
are
winning.
we're
winning
big.
we
have
fake
polls
out
there.
these
guys
do
fake
polls.
they
are
fake
polls.
i
had
a
poll.
it's
just
like
it
was
in
2016.
i'd
hear
these
polls.
i'd
hear
women
didn't
like
"me,"
and
i
did
great
with
women.
i
hear
everyone
didn't
like
me.
nobody
liked
me.
nobody
liked
me.
and
then
we
won.
thank
"you,"
women.
nobody
liked
me
2016.
"no,"
"no,"
i
hear
that.
"remember,"
women
didn't
like
"him,"
and
at
the
end
of
that
he
did
great
with
women.
he
did
great
with
this.
he
did
great
with
everybody.
we
did
great
with
everybody.
"remember,"
306
to
223.
that's
a
slaughter.
that's
a
slaughter.
"remember,"
they
said
he
cannot
"get,"
they
used
the
word
path.
there
is
no
"path,"
"right,"
to
270?
i
was
at
269
if
i
did
"great,"
but
they
said
there's
no
chance.
but
i
was
at
"269,"
so
i
went
to
maine.
i
love
maine.
i
went
to
maine.
maine's
cut
in
half.
and
one
maine
has
one.
i
went
there
four
or
five
times.
people
are
great.
i
won
it.
and
they
were
right.
there
is
no
path
to
"270,"
but
there
was
a
path
to
306.
these
people.
these
people.
there
is
no
path.
that's
"right,"
doug.
they
said
there
is
no
"path,"
the
fake
news
media.
"\"there"
is
no
path
for
donald
"trump.\""
and
then
they
said
the
evening
of
the
"election,"
"\"it's"
going
to
be
a
really
short
night
for
donald
trump.
thank
"god,"
we
got
rid
of
this
"guy.\""
because
they
did
the
exit
polls
going
"out,"
right?
and
i
was
even
"told,"
but
a
lot
of
people
didn't
want
to
talk
about
it.
the
highest
number
in
history
of
people
that
said
very
nasty
"language,"
but
i'm
not
going
to
use
that
name
because
you'll
kill
me
if
i
use
it.
so
i
won't
use
it.
it's
a
much
better
story
if
i
use
it
because
that's
the
truth.
that's
what
they
said.
"\"how"
did
you
"vote?\""
"usually,"
they
"say,"
"\"i"
voted
for
"clinton,\""
"or,"
"\"i"
voted
for
"trump.\""
right?
"\"how'd"
you
"vote?\""
"\"none"
of
your
"business.\""
"see,"
i'm
being
"nice,"
right?
i'll
keep
it
that
way
because
otherwise
we'll
ruin
the
whole
evening.
they'll
"say,"
"\"his"
"language,\""
right?
even
this
tough
guy
in
the
front
"says,"
"\"i"
"agree.\""
"\"how"
did
you
"vote?\""
"\"no,"
i
don't
want
to
tell
"you.\""
"\"how"
did
you
"vote?\""
"\"none"
of
your
damn
business.
i'm
not
going
to
tell
"you.\""
"\"how"
did
you
"vote?\""
"\"i'm"
not
…
"\""
and
it
was
like
this
massive
"number,"
right?
massive.
so
"everybody,"
they
just
didn't
count
that.
so
they
said
numbers
are
looking
unbelievably
well
for
crooked
hillary
clinton.
they're
looking
unbelievable.
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
short
evening
for
donald
trump.
we
finally
will
be
rid
of
this
guy.
and
then
the
numbers
started
coming
in.
the
numbers
started
coming
"in,"
and
it
started
with
the
great
state
of
florida.
donald
trump
has
won
the
state
of
florida.
and
then
that
beautiful
convention
"center,"
the
most
beautiful
stage
i've
ever
seen.
and
they
knew
something
was
going
on
because
they
didn't
pay
the
final
payment
for
the
fireworks
two
weeks
before.
right?
in
"fact,"
i
went
to
the
fireworks
"company,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"i'll"
give
you
five
cents
on
the
dollar
for
your
"fireworks,\""
even
though
they
were
no
way
near
where
my
area
was.
we
were
at
a
hotel
in
midtown.
we
liked
the
location
better
than
where
she
"chose,"
but
they
built
the
most
…
we
remember
that
beautiful
stage.
it
was
shaped
like
the
united
states
of
america.
and
by
the
"end,"
it
didn't
look
too
good.
did
you
ever
see
more
unhappy
people?
so
they
"go,"
"\"donald"
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
florida.
they
"go,"
"\"whoa,"
"whoa,"
"whoa.\""
they
outspent
me
like
five
to
one.
only
negative
ads.
they're
all
negative.
so
by
the
time
people
got
into
the
voters
"booth,"
they
only
knew
one
thing.
she
hated
donald
"trump,"
but
they
"said,"
"\"what"
the
hell
does
she
stand
for?
what
does
she
"do?\""
every
ad
was
a
negative
ad.
so
it
tells
you
negative
"ads,"
at
least
against
"me,"
aren't
so
good.
they
can
be
effective.
but
i
think
they
spent
like
$
2
billion
on
negative
ads.
everything
was
negative.
so
nobody
knew
what
the
hell
she
spent.
you
"know,"
her
husband
said
she
was
going
to
lose.
her
husband's
a
professional.
her
husband
"said,"
"\"you"
better
go
to
michigan
because
i
was
there
and
they
got
a
trump/pence
sign
on
every
lawn
i've
ever
seen.
you
better
go
to
"wisconsin,"
hillary.
you
better
go
to
"wisconsin.\""
she
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
haven't
lost
wisconsin
in
36
"years\"."
"\"no,"
"no,"
"hillary,"
you
got
to
go
there.
i'm
telling
"you,"
i
don't
like
what
i
"saw.\""
"\"no,"
what
do
you
"know?\""
he's
a
professional
politician.
she
wasn't.
it's
one
of
those
little
problems
in
life.
so
then
it
came
"in,"
and
then
we
won
south
carolina.
we
won
north
carolina.
right?
and
we
were
leading
pennsylvania
by
so
much
that
if
i
"lost,"
remember
at
2%
of
the
vote
"left,"
if
i
lost
every
single
"vote,"
i
win
by
a
lot.
they
"refused,"
the
fake
news
refused
to
call
it.
i
kept
"saying,"
"\"we"
won
pennsylvania.
why
don't
they
call
"it?\""
it
was
very
late
in
the
evening
when
they
called
it
because
they
are
"fake,"
they're
crooked.
they
are
fake.
and
i
"said,"
"\"why"
don't
they
call
"pennsylvania?\""
but
some
beautiful
things
happened.
and
by
the
"way,"
"ohio,"
we
won
by
one
of
the
largest
margins
ever.
the
"great,"
"great,"
great
state
of
ohio.
remember?
"remember,"
they
used
to
say
a
year
before
the
"election,"
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
nobody
can
win.
"nobody,"
unless
you
win
the
great
state
of
"ohio.\""
and
we
won
the
great
state
of
"ohio,"
and
we
won
it
big.
we
knew
we
were
going
to
win
it.
and
now
we're
up
a
lot
more
than
we
were
up
even
"then,"
because
you
know
why?
we're
bringing
back
jobs.
we're
bringing
back
factories.
everybody's
working.
nobody's
ever
had
a
better
year
than
we've
been
having.
and
we've
been
doing
it
for
a
long
"time,"
right?
almost
from
the
beginning.
and
don't
let
them
try
and
take
"credit,"
because
if
they
came
"in,"
we
would
have
ended
up
in
a
massive
recession
or
"worse,"
the
d
"word,"
depression.
we
would
have
"been,"
because
they
were
going
to
put
more
and
more
and
more
regulations
on.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
maybe
bigger
than
even
the
tax
"cuts,"
and
i
did
it
"sooner,"
were
the
regulation
cuts.
we
freed
up
our
nation
to
go
back
to
work.
true.
so
then
we
won
"wisconsin,"
and
then
we
won
michigan
because
those
"companies,"
now
they're
pouring
back
in.
the
auto
companies
are
pouring
back
"in,"
and
wisconsin's
doing
great
with
the
farmers
that
canada
was
taking.
you
"know,"
canada
was
charging
our
farmers
287%
tariffs
for
dairy
products.
okay?
so
what
happens
is
"this,"
we're
working
on
healthcare.
we're
fighting
to
stop
surprise
medical
billing.
i
just
signed
an
executive
order
imposing
price
transparency
because
when
providers
are
required
to
show
their
"prices,"
those
same
prices
fall
very
fast.
we've
approved
a
record
number
of
affordable
new
generic
"drugs,"
which
are
just
as
good
as
the
brand
"drugs,"
but
they
cost
a
tiny
fraction.
we've
totally
transformed
veteran's
"healthcare,"
including
getting
long-sought
va
choice
and
va
"accountability,"
which
they
said
could
not
be
done.
and
we
passed
the
spectacular
right
to
try.
so
if
you're
in
"trouble,"
and
i

produced

said

more

going

packer
fans
here
tonight?
that's

and
you
have

quarterback
who's

guy.
as
we
begin
the
"year,"
our
economy
is
"booming,"
wages
are
"rising,"
poverty
is
plummeting.
crime
is
falling
and
america
is
the
envy
of

"say,"
"\"we're"
not

let's
impeach

we've
got
the
greatest
economy

history.
our
military
has
been
totally
rebuilt.
"\"let's"
impeach

we've
created

million
jobs
since
the
"election,"
including
more
than
1
million
manufacturing
and
construction
jobs.
nobody
thought
that
was

we
will
soon
be
replacing

nafta
"catastrophe,"
one
of

worst
trade
deals
in
the
history
of

"world,"
frankly
with
the
incredible
us
"mca,"
"canada,"
"mexico,"
a
giant
victory
for
wisconsin
"workers,"
farmers
and
dairy
"producers,"
a
tremendous
victory.
and
we
may
get
that
all
taken
care
of
this
week
or
next
week.
it
just
needs
one
more
vote
and
we'll
get
that
out
of

republican
senate.
the
republican
senate
will
be
great.
tomorrow
we'll
also
be
signing

deal
with

massively
boosting
exports
of
products
made
and
produced
right
here

years
of
devastating
defense
"cuts,"

have
fully
rebuilt

a
point
that
it
has
never

it's
now
more
"advanced,"
more
"lethal,"

more
powerful
than
ever.
and
last
"year,"
our
great
american
"warriors,"
because
that's
what
they
are.
and
they
love
it.
i
got
to
tell
"you,"
they
love
"it,"
right?
they
love
doing
that.
they
wouldn't
trade
places
with
me
under
any
circumstances.
they
wouldn't
trade
places
with
all
of
our
great
wisconsin
politicians.
they
want
to
be
a
military
warrior
and
we
don't
want
them
for
that.
we
want
them
doing
what
they're
doing.
but
our
great
warriors
carried
out
a
daring
nighttime
raid
and
terminated
the
founder
and
leader
of
isis.
the
animal
known
as
al-baghdadi
is
dead
and
the
wicked
caliphate
is
100%
destroyed.
and
i
will
tell
you
when
we
took
over
a
little
less
than
three
years
"ago,"
isis
was
all
over
the
place.
now
the
caliphate
is
100%
destroyed.
do
you
remember
when
i
wanted
to
leave
when
it
was
at
98%?
i
"said,"
let
some
of
the
other
countries
finish
it
off.
we're
going
"home,"
right?
they
all
"said,"
"\"oh,"
no
"sir,"
please
finish
"it.\""
so
we
finished
it
off
to
100%.
a
few
days
ago.
we
took
bold
and
decisive
action
to
defend
american
lives
and
deliver
american
justice.
at
my
"direction,"
the
united
states
military
launched
a
flawless
precision
strike
that
killed
the
world's
number
one
"terrorist,"
number
one
terrorist.
do
you
know
who
that
is?
qasem
"soleimani,"
number
one
terrorist
in

world.
soleimani
was
responsible
for
murdering
and
wounding
thousands
of
americans
and
was
actively
planning
new
"attacks,"
but
we
stopped
them
cold.
and
"frankly,"
they
already
started
the
"attack,"
as
you
saw
in
"baghdad,"
on
our
very
large
embassy
in
baghdad.
that
was
already
started.
and
i
said
to
our
"generals,"
"\"get"
there
now.
we
don't
want
to
have
another
benghazi.
not
on
my
"watch,"
or
on
any
"watch.\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we'll
be
there
"tomorrow.\""
i
"said,"
"\"nope,"
you
got
to
be
there
right
now.
get
them
over
there
"now.\""
there
are
thousands
of
soldiers.
they

soldiers.
you
take
a
look
at
that
crowd.
that
was
not
protesters.
they
were
"soldiers,"
and
they
were
surrounding
our
embassy
in
baghdad.
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
see
these
"beautiful,"
very
"expensive,"
i
will
tell
"you,"
brand
new
apache
helicopters
roaming
over
the
top.
and
then
they
see
our
great
military.
you
saw
them
in
the
"plane,"
right?
some
of
them
were
getting
out
of
their
pajamas.
they
were.
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
worry
about
"it.\""
i
"said,"
"\"we"
won't
put
that
"on.\""
but
they
were
sitting
there
and
they
were
calling
a
roll
call
in
the
plane.
right?
and
it
was
a
beautiful
sight.
and
these
guys
were
better
than
tom
cruise
at
his
best.
""
protestors
disturb
the

one
"protester,"
a
very
weak
voice.
if
you
people
wouldn't
go
crazy
every
time
you
see
"something,"
he'd
go
right
through
and
nobody
would
even
know
she
was
there.
now
she's
going
home
to
mom
where
she
will
be
in
big
trouble.
because
i
guarantee
you
that
mom
voted
for
trump.
and
in
10
years
from
"now,"
when
i
run
yet
"again,"
she'll
be
voting
for
trump
too.
i'm
only
kidding.
i'm
only
kidding.
we
drive
them
crazy.
we
drive
them
crazy.
they
"say,"
"\"you"
know
he's
not

don't
you?
he's
never

they
"say,"
"\"he's"
going

he's
never
going

"leave.\""
these
"people,"
it's
called
trump
derangement
syndrome.
it
really
is.
you
know
what
they
don't
know
is
that
if
for
any
"reason,"
after
five
years
we
do
"leave,"
which
we
"will,"
because
i
believe
in
that
stuff.
right?
but
you
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
their
industry.
they're
all
going
to
die
and
fold
up.
going
to
be
very
boring
out
"there,"
very
boring.
that's
why
i
say
at
some
"point,"
every
single
one
of
them
will
be
endorsing
donald
trump.
but
crazy
bernie
sanders
and
the
washington
"democrats,"
by
the
"way,"
bernie
is
surging.
bernie
is
surging.
bernie.
but
the
democrats
are
outraged
that
we
kill
this
terrorist
monster
even
though
this
monster
was
behind
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
death.
that's
two.
"hey,"
speaking
of
"protesters,"
have
you
seen
what's
happened
in
iran?
the
protesters
are
on
our
side.
first
time
ever.
they're
on
our
side.
in
"fact,"
they
put
this
big
american
flag
on
the
street.
and
the
"iranians,"
thousands
and
thousands
of
iranians
were
supposed
to
walk
on
it
and
trample
it
and
step
and
beat
the
hell
out
of
it.
every
one
of
them
went
around
that
flag.
they
like
trump.
they
like
you.
i'm
just
your
"representative,"
but
they
like
us.
they
like
us.
they
haven't
seen
anything
like
that
in
a
long
time.
they
went
"around,"
did
you
see
it?
they
went
around
the
flag.
they
didn't
want
to
touch
it.
they
love
america.
they
love
our
country.
that's
called
progress.
that's
called
progress.
but
the
democrats
are
doing
everything
possible
to
disparage
what
we
did
with
the
hit
on
this
monster.
many
of
the
young
men
and
women
you
see
walking
around
without
"arms,"
without
legs
and
without

done
by
soleimani.
that's
what
he
loved.
he
loved
the
roadside
bomb.
that's
what
he
loved.
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
in
"iraq,"
in
"afghanistan,"
roadside
bombs.
he
was
the
king
of
the
roadside
bombs.
great
percentages
of
people
don't
have
legs
right
now
and
arms
because
of
this
son
of
a
bitch.
now
the
democrats
should
be
outraged
by
soleimani's
evil
"crimes,"
not
that
decision
to
end
his
wretched
life.
they're
"saying,"
"\"well,"
he
was
a
general.
he
was
this.
he
was
"that.\""
you
know
what?
number
"one,"
he
wasn't
supposed
to
be
there.
he
was
a
designated
terrorist
by
president
obama
who
didn't
do
anything
about
it
as
usual.
as
"usual,"
they
don't
do
anything.
they
designate
and
they
don't
do
anything
about.
he
should've
been
killed
20
years
ago.
"now,"
here's
the
story
with
the
democrats.
if
i
didn't
kill
"him,"
and
let's
say
we
lost
"three,"
"four,"
five
embassies
or
bases
or
thousands
of
people
or
hundreds
of
people
or
two
people
were
"killed,"
they
would
have
"said,"
"\"trump"
should
have
taken
him
"out.\""
anything
we
"do,"
they
go
the
opposite.
so
we
kill
him.
and
that
was
precision.
some
people
thought
it
went
much
too
fast.
went
too
fast.
so
we
kill
him
and
they
"say,"
"\"what"
a
horrible
"…\""
if
we
didn't
kill
"him,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"what"
a
horrible
"thing.\""
right?
and
by
the
"way,"
they
think
they
caught
me.
they
never
catch
us.
because
mexico's
paying
for
the
wall.
you
know
that.
you'll
see
that.
it's
all
worked
out.
mexico's
paying.
it's
driving
them
crazy.
now
they
"say,"
"\"okay,"
he's
building
the
wall.
but
mexico
didn't
"pay.\""
mexico
will
pay.
and
here's
the
thing.
you'll
see
that
it'll
come
out.
we'll
do
it
sometime
during
the
debate
or
maybe
before.
our
"debate,"
the
real
debate
that
people
are
going
to
"watch,"
because
nobody's
watching.
haven't
been
doing
great
on
the
debates.
i
have
to
tell
you.
but
we
are
building
this
wall.
we're
over
100
miles
right
now.
we're
going
to
be
expanding
the
length.
you
have
a
lot
of
natural
where
you
have
"1,978"
miles.
you
need
500
"miles,"
but
700
would
be
"good,"
750
or
so
would
be
great.
we're
going
to
now
get
it
up.
we
have
all
the
financing.
you
think
it's
easy
getting
financing
when
people
put
…
i
can
get
anything
from
them.
i
can
get
whatever
i
want
in
terms
of
money
except
for
a
wall.
and
i
made
one
big
mistake.
i
should
have
said
to
"them,"
"\"we"
will
not
build
the
wall.
we
don't
want
the
"wall.\""
they
would
have
insisted
that
we
build
it.
we
would
have
had
all
the
money
we
wanted.
i
made
a
mistake.
i
made
a
big
mistake.
now
we're
building
the
wall.
it's
going
up
and
it's
going
up
rapidly
and
very
soon
we'll
be
building
about
a
mile
a
day.
and
we
should
be
up
to
over
400
miles
by
next
"year,"
the
end
of
next
"year,"
and
shortly
thereafter
it'll
be
finished.
and
it's
already
having
a
tremendous
impact
on
people
not
being
able
to
come
into
our
country.
bernie
and
the
radical
left
cannot
protect
your
family
and
they
cannot
protect
our
"country,"
nor
do
they
want
"to,"
i
think.
according
to
elizabeth
pocahontas
"warren,"
who
has
somewhat
less
indian
blood
in
her
than
i
"do,"
and
i
have
none.
remember?
"oh,"
we
hit
her
hard.
but
i
hit
her
too
"early,"
but
now
it
doesn't
matter.
she's
not
going
anywhere.
but
bernie
"said,"
according
to
"her,"
bernie
"said,"
and
i
don't
believe
that
he
said
"this,"
because
i
don't
know
him.
i
don't
particularly
like
him.
he's
a
nasty
guy.
but
i
don't
believe
he
said
it.
it's
not
his
field.
you
have
to
know
what
people
say.
she
"said,"
"right,"
that
bernie
stated
strongly
that
a
woman
can't
win
for
president.
a
woman
can
win
for
president.
fortunately
that
could
happen.
who
knows?
but
she
said
that
bernie
"said,"
"\"a"
woman
can't
"win.\""
i
don't
believe
that
bernie
said
that.
i
really
don't
know.
just
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
thing
he'd
say.
if
you
want
to
keep
america
"safe,"
just
vote
republican.
we're
doing
so
well.
we're
doing
so
well.
now
this
was
…
leave
him
alone.
that's
all
right.
let
security
just
take
care
of
her.
"okay,"
you
all
right?
get
him
out
here.
good.
good
job
security.
good
job.
do
we
love
law
enforcement?
and
is
there
"ever,"
ever
a
better
place
to
be
than
a
trump
rally
on
some
night
during
some
week?
the
"truth,"
is
we
have
a
great
time.
but
you
know
what?
more
importantly
we
get
things
done.
we're
getting
everything
done.
but
even
president
obama's
own
former
national
security
"advisor,"
a
highly
respected
general
named
jim
"jones,"
praised
our
action
to
take
out
soleimani
and
said
it
was
absolutely
correct
and
it
was
the
absolute
right
thing
to
do.
i'm
sure
they
like
him
very
much.
he
sounds
like
our
kind
of
a
guy.
so
"jim,"
if
they've
given
you
a
hard
"time,"
come
on
over
to
the
republican
party.
"no,"
he's
a
respected
guy.
he
said
we
did
the
right
thing.
everyone
knows.
they're
"saying,"
"\"was"
the
attack
eminent?
was
it
"eminent?\""
does
the
fact
that
he's
killed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
and
thousands
of
americans
and
horribly
killed
and
wounded
thousands
and
thousands?
that
doesn't
matter.
was
the
attack
eminent?
i
think
they're
going
to
start
a
new
investigation.
was
the
attack
or
this
horror
…
and
by
the
"way,"
he
was
in
a
country
he
wasn't
allowed
to
be
in.
we
don't
mention
that
because
he
was
designated
and
he
wasn't
allowed
to
be
there.
and
he
was
there
with
the
head
of
"hezbollah,"
and
they
were
talking
"about,"
like
hillary
clinton.
they
were
talking
about
weddings
and
working
out.
soleimani
and
the
head
of
"hezbollah,"
they
were
talking
about
"weddings,"
working
out.
or
bill
clinton
in
the
back
of
the
airplane
with
the
attorney
"general,"
where
they
may
have
made
her
an
offer
that
you're
going
to
go
to
the
supreme
court.
or
they
may
have
"said,"
"\"you're"
going
to
to
stay
attorney
"general,"
but
help.
"help.\""
they
may
have
said
that.
do
you
think
they
would
have
said
that?
no.
nothing
like
that.
but
do
you
remember?
they
talked
about
golf
and
"grandchildren,"
right?
45
minutes.
i
like
golf.
45
minutes.
i
like
golf
and
i
love
my
grandchildren.
i
don't
think
i
can
talk
to
somebody
about
them
for
45
minutes
that
i
don't
even
know.
45.
i
have
a
beautiful
grandchild.
he's
really
beautiful.
he's
so
great.
okay.
what
else
am
i
going
to
"say,"
right?
then
i
took
a…
let's
talk
one
or
two.
how's
tiger
doing?
how's
this
one?
how's
that
one?
that's
another
five
"minutes,"
right?
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
the
other
35
minutes?
maybe
i'm
going
to
talk
about
supreme
court
"appointments,"
et
cetera.
got
zero.
he
got
zero
out
of
it.
he
got
zero.
i'd
love
to
have
that
money
back.
it's
a
lot
of
money.
but
i've
warned
the
ayatollah
and
the
government
of
iran
that
they
must
not
"harm,"
"hurt,"
or
kill
any
protesters.
the
whole
world
is
watching.
it's
watching.
they've
killed
thousands
of
protests.
we
support
the
iranian
people
and
their
courageous
struggle
for
freedom.
it's
incredible
what's
going
on
over
there.
it
really
is.
but
we're
watching
it.
we're
watching
very
closely.
and
we
were
ready.
that
night
when
the
attack
was
made
on
"us,"
attack
was
made
on
us.
remember
"this,"
they
killed
an
"american,"
they
killed
other
people
just
before
that.
and
so
we
did
what
we
"did,"
right?
and
they
"said,"
it's
our
turn
now.
i
"said,"
you
better
be
careful
when
you
say
it's
our
turn.
because
we
had
designated
targets
that
you
wouldn't
know…
it
would
have
taken
him
30
years
to
rebuild
if
that
was
even
possible.
it's
"true,"
it's
true.
and
we
saw
those
missiles
"launched,"
and
they
were
big
and
they
were
"fast,"
and
they
were
accurate.
four
of
them
went
bad.
they
fell
way
short.
but
12
of
them
hit.
and
i
"said,"
"man,"
they
are
quick.
they
knew
immediately
what
they
"were,"
and
they
saw
those
missiles
hit.
i
"said,"
how
bad
is
it?
it
hit
a
base.
and
an
hour
later
or
"so,"
we
get
a
call
back.
i
"said,"
how
many
killed?
"nobody,"
sir.
i
"said,"
how
many
hurt?
they
"said,"
"nobody,"
sir.
and
i
"said,"
they
just
saved
themselves
a
trillion
dollars
and
a
lot
of
lives.
that's
true.
a
"trillion,"
not
a
billion.
a
trillion.
so
they
did
a
very
smart
thing
and
we're
not
looking
for
regime
change.
they've
tried
that
with
libya.
they
"go,"
hillary
"clinton,"
let's
get
rid
of
libya.
let's
get
rid
of
gaddafi.
let's
get
rid
of
gaddafi.
how's
that
working
out?
right?
let's
get
rid
of
gaddafi.
that
was
a
hillary
deal.
then
you
had
benghazi.
and
see
"benghazi,"
they
didn't
respond.
they
didn't
respond.
should
be.
should
be
to
iraq.
iraq
didn't
knock
down
the
world
trade
center
just
in
case
anybody
had
any
question.
and
this
guy
did
kill.
he
was
not
a
sweetheart.
he
was
a
bad
guy
in
every
way.
but
he
did
kill
"terrorists,"
right?
and
it
became
harvard
university
for
"terrorists,"
right?
but
they
did
go
after
"him,"
but
he
didn't
knock
down
out.
you
know
what
i
did
with
the
soldiers?
they
don't
tell
you
the
"truth,"
"sorry,"
because
there
are
a
bunch
of
corrupt
people
back
there.
i
told
"turkey,"
you
got
to
defend
your
own
border.
we're
not
going
to
defend
your
border.
and
we
get
along
with
turkey.
we
get
"along,"
but
they've
been
there
for…
and
by
the
"way,"
i
call
it
a
safe
zone.
that
is
the
most
dangerous
safe
zone
in
the
world.
okay?
i'm
looking
at
the
"audience,"
there's
about
three
of
you
that
want
to
be
in
that
"zone,"
okay?
and
you're
very
tough
people.
but
this
is
the
most
dangerous…
i
call
"it,"
i
call
it
the
safe
zone.
some
day
it
may
be
a
safe
"zone,"
but
i
took
our
soldiers
"out,"
because
we
had
an
army
here
and
we
had
a
vast
number
of
people
"here,"
and
they
were
going
to
fight.
i
"said,"
if
they're
going
to
fight
like
they
have
been
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
"years,"
for
"centuries,"
let
them
fight.
but
we're
getting
the
hell
out
of
"there,"
okay?
but
the
fake
news
doesn't
tell
you
the
right
story.
but
the
fake
news
doesn't
tell
you
the
right
story.
because
what
i
did
is
i
took
our
"soldiers,"
and
you
know
what
i
did?
i
moved
them
to
the
oil
"area,"
and
we
now
control
the
oil.
so
they
said
trump
stayed
in
syria.
trump
"said,"
so
people
said
to
"me,"
why
you
staying
in
syria?
okay?
a
long
time
ago.
you
have
no
idea
the
things
and
the
decisions
i've
seen.
so
they
say
trump's
in
"syria,"
i
didn't
pull
out.
i
did
pull
out.
we
have
the
oil
really
secure.
we'll
see
what
happens
with
"it,"
but
we
can
help
our
"friends,"
the
"kurds,"
because
that's
where
they
got
their
wealth.
and
then
ultimately
it
was
with
isis.
but
right
now
it's
with
the
united
states
military.
and
we
also
got
rid
of
remnants
of
isis.
while
we're
creating
jobs
and
killing
"terrorists,"
democrats
in
congress
are
wasting
america's
time
with
demented
hoaxes
and
crazy
witch
hunts
that
had
been
going
on
by
the
"way,"
from
the
day
i
came
down
the
escalator
with
our
future
first
lady.
somebody
said
to
me
"recently,"
"president,"
"president,"
it
was
a
friend
of
"mine,"
used
to
always
call
me
donald.
hey
"donald,"
how
are
you
doing?
let's
go
have
dinner.
"okay,"
"okay,"
good.
now
he
calls
me
president.
i
told
you
this
before.
calls
me
pres…
they
always
call
me
president.
"president,"
"president,"
tell
me
what's
"happening,"
what's
going
"on,"
how's
it
all
going?
you're
doing
such
a
great
job.
i
"said,"
do
me
a
favor.
call
me
donald.
i
can't.
now
when
they
"say,"
you
know
what
that
"means,"
right?
that
means
respect
for
the
office
of
president.
and
you
know
what?
we're
going
to
keep
that
way.
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
we're
going
to
keep
it
there.
but
that's
why
this
november
we're
going
back
and
we're
going
to
win
the
house.
the
republicans
are
going
to
win
the
house.
because
i
don't
know
if
you
know
it.
the
impeachment
"hoax,"
it's
a
total
hoax.
this
is
based…
just
think
of
this.
this
is
based
on
a
perfect
phone
call.
did
anybody
read
the
transcript?
it's
a
perfect
call.
in
"fact,"
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
lyndon
"johnson,"
all
of
them.
lyndon
johnson
was
sort
of
a
tough
guy.
can
you
imagine
his
phone
calls?
he's
probably
looking
down
or
looking
"up,"
and
he's
probably
"saying,"
these
people
have
gone
crazy.
that's
the
nicest
call
i've
ever
tracked.
somebody
"said,"
i
never
knew
you
could
be
so
nice
on
a
telephone
call.
but
this
is
all
based
on
a
simple
phone
call
that
was
totally
appropriate
where
the
president
of
ukraine
said
there
was
no
pressure
on
us.
didn't
even
know
what
they
were
talking
about.
the
foreign
minister
said
they
want
to
impeach.
impeach
the
president
of
the
united
states
over
a
perfect
phone
call.
it's
the
greatest
hoax
ever
perpetrated
on
our
country.
ever.
i
don't
know
if
you've
seen.
independent
voters
and
voters
i
think
of
all
of
the
"voters,"
including
democrats
moving
"over,"
we
just
got
a
195
to
"nothing,"
the
republicans
in
the
"house,"
which
was
a
fix.
nancy
pelosi
says
it
must
be
nonpartisan.
and
she
"said,"
it
has
to
be
clear
cut.
"well,"
number
"one,"
never
happened.
no
problem.
number
"two,"
look
at
the
vote.
three
democrats
voted
with
us.
so
i
guess
you
could
say
it
was
a
nonpartisan
vote
because
they
voted
with
"us,"
okay?
but
we're
going
back
and
we're
going
to
hold
the
senate.
and
we're
going
to
keep
the
white
"house,"
but
we're
going
to
win
back
the
house.
we're
going
to
win
back
the
house.
and
i'm
thrilled
tonight.
a
man
who
has
become
a
great
friend
of
"mine,"
he's
a
warrior.
senator
ron
johnson
is
here.
come
up
here.
what
a
good
guy.
congressman
bryan
steil.
jim
sensenbrenner.
glenn
grothman.
"glenn,"
come
up.
come
up.
mike
gallagher.
wisconsin
house
speaker
robin
voss.
wisconsin
state
senate
president
roger
roth.
state
senate
president.
come
on
fellas.
wisconsin
state
senate
majority
leader
scott
fitzgerald.
a
friend
of
"mine,"
a
world
champion.
would
you
believe
it?
is
sean
here?
where's
sean?
where's
sean?
get
up
here.
i
love
champions.
he
would
climb
that
sucker.
he
was
the
best
in
the
world
right
here
from
"wisconsin,"
right?
congressman
sean
duffy.
we
miss
him.
but
he
signed
with
cnn.
they
paid
him
a
lot
of
"money,"
and
they
don't
put
them
on.
why?
because
i'm
pro-trump.
you
think
that's
"fair,"
right?
he's
pro-trump.
so
what
they've
done
is
paid
him
money
to
silence
him
because
he
has
a
very
important
voice.
great
job.
"yeah,"
i
like
that
kind
of
a
job.
i
think
he's
okay
with
it.
he
gets
his
"check,"
they
refuse
to
put
him
on.
he
says
good
things
about
trump.
we
don't
want
you
on.
that's
cnn.
that's
how
fake
right
there.
turn
the
camera
on.
and
a
good
friend
of
all
of
"ours,"
a
kenosha
"native,"
reince
priebus.
"reince,"
come
up.
thank
"you,"
man.
thank
you
reince.
this
is
a
great
group
of
republican
"people,"
but
more
"importantly,"
it's
a
great
group
of
winners.
they
have
been
so
"great,"
so
they
worked
so
hard
and
i
just
want
to
thank
you
all
for
being
here
tonight.
thank
you.
thank
you
ron.
a
great
guy.
thanks
to
strong
republican
leadership
like
"ron,"
like
all
of
them
that
you
just
"saw,"
america
is
winning
again.
america
is
respected
again.
and
america
is
thriving
again
like
never
before.
we're
doing
great.
we're
the
envy
of
the
world.
and
under
my
"administration,"
we
now
have
the
lowest
average
unemployment
rate
of
any
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
in
your
great
"state,"
wisconsin…
you
ever
noticed
with
"biden,"
he's
always
calling
the
wrong
state?
and
in
your
great
state
of
"iowa,"
iowa.
it's
"iowa,"
right?
"no,"
it's
wisconsin.
"oh,"
i
meant
wisconsin.
"oh,"
i
didn't
know
i
was
in
wisconsin.
that's
fine.
how
many
times
has
he
done
"that,"
by
the
way?
lots
of
"times,"
he
said.
it's
great
to
be
in
the
state
of
ohio.
no
"sir,"
you're
in
florida.
many
times.
the
sad
part
about
that…
sleepy
joe
is
right.
you
know
the
sad
part
about
that?
when
you
do
"that,"
you
can't
really
recover.
you
can
be
winston
"churchill,"
make
the
finest
remainder
of
"remarks,"
but
you
get
killed.
and
he
does
it
every
time.
and
the
fake
"news,"
they
give
him
a
total
pass
and
that's
okay.
it's
all
right.
it's
going
to
happen
to
all
of
us
someday.
does
anybody
get
that?
yeah.
in
"wisconsin,"
the
unemployment
rate
has
reached
its
lowest
level
in
history.
how's
that
for
a
sound
bite?
how
do
you
beat
that
sound
"bite,"
right?
so
now
the
people
of
wisconsin
are
going
to
"say,"
well
let's
see
the
state
set
a
"record,"
most
successful
it's
ever
been.
and
by
the
"way,"
that's
because
we
got
a
lot
of
help
from
a
guy
named
scott
walker.
your
governor.
ron
"johnson,"
all
those
guys.
because
this
didn't
happen
so
quickly.
but
think.
so
how
do
you
beat
that?
you
have
the
most
"successful,"
lowest
unemployment
rate
you've
ever
had.
and
then
they
"say,"
somebody's
going
to
come
and
"say,"
well
we'll
do
a
better
job.
"really,"
you're
going
to
do
a
better
job?
the
lowest
in
history
by
"far,"
your
number
one
economic
numbers
by
far.
"oh,"
let's
put
somebody
else
in
as
president.
i
don't
think
so.
right?
but
here's
one
that
i
loved
the
most.
african
"american,"
hispanic
"american,"
asian
american
unemployment
rates
have
reached
the
lowest
levels
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
country.
and
here's
another
one.
african
american
"youth,"
the
way
it
was
was
so
high
was
so
horrible.
youth
unemployment
has
reached
an
all
time
low
in
recorded
history.
african-american
poverty
has
reached
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded
also.
the
only
question
are
you
at
"70,"
"80,"
"90,"
97%?
he
goes
higher.
what
are
you
at?
what's
yours?
100%.
not
bad.
i
know
who
he's
voting
for.
but
think
of
"this,"
because
this
is
what
it's
about.
is
that
these
"companies,"
these
big
public
"companies,"
they're
owned
by
the
"people,"
they're
owned
by
everybody.
rich
"people,"
and
they're
owned
by
everybody.
we
have
set
141
records
on
the
stock
"market,"
highest
levels
ever
in
recorded
history.
141
records.
that
"means,"
in
less
than
three
"years,"
for
141
"days,"
we
set
a
record.
think
of
"it,"
we've
said
141
records.
who
the
hell
can
do
that?
and
if
our
opponents
had
won
the
"election,"
instead
of
going
"up,"
we're
very
close
to
"30,000"
on
the
dow.
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
and
clearly
the
fakers
back
"there,"
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
instead
of
being
"up,"
you
would
have…
i
"believe,"
i
really
"believe,"
because
"regulation,"
so
"important,"
tax
"cuts,"
so
important
to
get
it
all
going.
i
believe
instead
of
being
up
"massively,"
whatever
the
number
"is,"
but
depending
on
who
you
"are,"
"changes,"
but
it's
all
way
over
"60,"
"70,"
"80,"
you
guys
know.
you
would
have
been
down
"50,"
"60,"
70.
you
would
have
been
down
at
a
"level,"
you
would
probably
be
extremely
"depressed,"
right
now.
you
wouldn't
have
bought
all
those
brand
new
keep
america
great
hats.
don't
"worry,"
we're
never
getting
rid
of
"maga,"
don't
worry.
we
don't
have
the
courage
to
get
rid
of
maga.
the
greatest
campaign
in
history.
we're
never
leaving.
but
you
wouldn't
have
bought
those
hats.
you
know
why?
you
wouldn't
have
the
money
to
buy
him.
okay?
now
you
can
buy
"them,"
it
doesn't
mean
a
damn
thing.
so
let's
do
it
real
fast.
the
"poll,"
right?
make
america
great
"again,"
or
keep
america
"great,"
right?
i
don't
have
to
go
through
the
whole
deal.
we're
going
to
do
it
quick.
we're
going
to
do
it
quickly.
ready?
who
likes
make
america
great
again?
whoa.
they're
very
loyal
people
in
wisconsin.
who
likes
keep
america
great?
all
right.
so
it
surprises
me
every
single
time.
but
make
america
great
"again,"
"maga,"
has
never
won
one
of
these
polls.
you
know
why?
we've
rebuilt
our
"military,"
we've
cut
"taxes,"
we've
cut
"regulation,"
our
stock
market
hit
records.
it's
called
keep
america
great.
i
"mean,"
we've
done
so
much.
and
i
just
got
a
free…
see
these
"democrats,"
they
go
out
and
spend
$1
million
on
a
poll.
what
i
do
is
i
take
my
own
poll.
and
they'll
interview
203
people.
203
people
say
they'll
get
it
wrong.
because
i'm
always
surprised.
make
america
great
again
i
think
is
the
greatest
phrase
ever
used
in
"politics,"
right?
but
under
the
trump
"economy,"
the
lowest
paid
earners
are
reaping
the
"biggest,"
"fastest,"
and
largest
games.
you
know
that
right?
this
is
a
blue
collar
boom.
they
don't
like
telling
you
that.
under
my
"administration,"
the
growth
in
net
worth
for
the
bottom
half
of
wage
earners
has
increased
15
times
more
than
under
the
three
previous
administrations.
that's
pretty
amazing.
because
they
keep
"saying,"
"oh,"
the
rich
are
getting
richer.
"well,"
the
poor
are
doing
the
best
they've
ever
done.
earnings
for
the
bottom
10%
are
rising
faster
than
earnings
for
the
top
10%
proportionately.
under
eight
years
of
the
barack
hussein
obama
administration.
which
administration
loves
spying
on
people's
campaigns?
by
the
"way,"
by
the
"way,"
could
you
imagine
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
and
i
spied
on
his
campaign?
what
would
these
fake
news
people
be
doing?
more
than
"300,000"
people
under
"obama,"
"300,000"
people
left
the
workforce.
under
just
three
years
of
by
"administration,"
3.5
million
people
have
joined
the
workforce
and
nobody
believed
that
was
possible.
370
companies
have
signed
our
pledge
to
america's
workers
providing
more
than
14
million
americans
with
new
training
and
job
opportunities.
we're
training
them.
we're
getting
"them,"
"walmart,"
so
many
great
"companies,"
they're
training
"people,"
because
they
can
train
a
much
better
than
government.
14
"million,"
you
know
who
has
worked
so
hard
on
that?
"everybody,"
you've
heard
of
"ivanka,"
right?
ivanka.
she
had
such
a
passion
for
it.
she's
very
smart.
i
"said,"
would
you
like
this?
you
have
no
debt.
i
want
to
get
people
working.
i
want
to
get
them
and
help
families.
so
i
"said,"
all
"right,"
good.
"look,"
she's
smart.
go
do
whatever
the
hell
you
want
to
"do,"
it's
"okay,"
darling.
so
she
had
a
goal
of
a
half
a
million
people.
she
was
going
to
get
"trained,"
get
into
companies.
so
she'd
call
"walmart,"
she'd
call
"exxon,"
she'd
call
all
these
great
companies.
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
hit
8
million.
then
she
hit
9
million.
don't
"forget,"
she
wanted
to
do
"500,000,"
but
this
is
her.
then
she
had
10
million.
she
just
hit
14
million
people
have
been
trained
by
these
great
companies.
14
million.
ivanka.
14
"million,"
would
you
believe
that's
possible?
but
that's
why
we
have
the
best
unemployment
"rates,"
we
have
the
best
employment
rates.
by
the
"way,"
very
close
to
160
million
people
are
now
working
in
the
united
states.
nobody's
ever
even
come
close
to
that
number.
we've
lifted
10
million
people
off
federal
welfare
programs.
real
median
income
is
now
at
the
highest
level
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
country.
think
of
that.
real
median
income.
under
eight
"years,"
so
we're
here
three
years
"right,"
but
really
less
because
when
it
was
"done,"
the
"stats,"
it
was
two
and
a
half.
but
we
have
less
than
three.
under
eight
years
of
the
bush
"administration,"
household
incomes
grew
$400.
eight
"years,"
$400.
under
eight
years
of
president
"obama,"
household
incomes
grew
"$975,000."
that's
"okay,"
975.
eight
"years,"
right?
under
three
years
of
the
trump
"administration,"
household
incomes
have
risen
"$10,000."
ten
thousand.
that's
why
we're
doing
well.
the
consumer.
"$3,100"
of
which
for
regulatory
"cuts,"
"$2,000"
for
the
tax
"cuts,"
it's
actually
higher
than
"that,"
"$2,500"
for
energy
"savings,"
and
"$5,000"
in
real
wage
gains.
"$10,000."
the
child
tax
credit
"alone,"
which
every
democrat
in
congress
"opposed,"
is
delivering
"$2,200"
a
year
to
the
average
american
family.
who's
in
favor
of
that
cut.
who's
in
favor
of
having
that?
you?
people
don't
know.
they
think
the
democrats
gave
it.
the
democrats
give
nothing.
they're
too
busy.
they're
too
busy
doing
other
things.
they
don't
do
anything.
they're
too
busy
doing
other
things.
we
ended
the
war
on
american
energy.
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
on
earth.
number
one
in
the
world
by
far.
saudi
"arabia,"
"russia,"
but
we're
number
one
by
far.
and
if
i
get
a
couple
of
additional
pipelines
"approved,"
which
i
will
very
"quickly,"
instead
of
waiting
20
years
to
get
them
"approved,"
it'll
increase
this
by
another
22%
that
will
get
them
done
quickly.
and
they'll
be
environmentally
friendly
and
all
of
that.
i
believe
in
that.
we
have
eliminated
a
record
number
of
job-destroying
regulations.
i
brought
back
the
old
light
bulb.
better
light
for
much
less
"money,"
if
you
want
"it,"
right?
little
things.
somebody
"said,"
oh
"sir,"
don't
mention
the
light
bulb.
it's
hard
to
make
an
elegant
speech.
i'm
saying
i
brought
back
the
light
bulb.
so
the
new
light
bulb
costs
you
five
times
as
"much,"
and
it
makes
you
look
orange.
and
i
was
more
interested
in
the
orange
than
i
was
in
the
cost.
but
you
know
"what,"
if
you
"want,"
you
have
it.
and
the
new
"bulb,"
i
don't
know
if
you
see
"it,"
it's
on
there.
it's
a
hazardous
waste.
when
that
bulb
"ends,"
you're
supposed
to
take
it
to
a
certain
dump
and
gingerly
put
it
in
because
it's
loaded
up
with
gasses.
that's
the
new…
i
said
to
somebody
today
in
environmental
"protection,"
how
many
people
do
that
in
the
country?
"sir,"
maybe
none.
they
throw
it
into
the
garbage
can.
and
it's…
wait.
and
it
was
just
announced
from
south
"korea,"
makes
a
lot
of
our
"products,"
"unfortunately,"
i
put
a
tariff
on
washing
machines
and
"refrigerators,"
right?
they
just
announced
that
they're
building
major
refrigerator
and
washing
machine
plants
in
the
united
states.
you
know
why?
you
know
why?
because
they
don't
want
to
pay
the
25%
tariff.
so
they're
building
them
here.
that
way
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
tariff.
and
just
one
final
thing.
i
know
this
doesn't
"matter,"
but
i
said
leave
it.
it's
so
inelegant
to-
i
know
this
doesn't
"matter,"
but
i
said
leave
it.
it's
so
inelegant
to
talk
about
"it,"
right?
right?
isn't
it
inelegant?
i'm
talking
about
dishwashers.
wait
till
you
hear
the
next
one.
i'm
talking
about
refrigerators.
probably
wanting
to
say
to
the
"union,"
i'll
leave
it
out
because
i
want
to
get
praise
for
making
a
…
you
cannot
make
a
brilliant
speech
where
they
"say,"
"\"that"
was
such
an
"incredible,"
elegant
"speech,\""
if
i'm
talking
about
"dishwashers,"
"sinks,"
"toilets,"
light
bulbs.
but
"sinks,"
toilets
and
"showers,"
you
don't
get
any
water.
they
put
restrictors
on
and
now
they
made
them
permanent.
people
used
to
take
them
out.
they
put
restrictors
on.
try
going
and
buying
a
new
faucet.
you
turn
it
"on,"
no
water
comes
"out,"
right?
we
won't
talk
about
"toilets,"
but
you
know
that's
…
"10,"
"15,"
but
we
don't
talk
about
that.
because
i've
said
this
three
or
four
"times,"
the
only
subject
they
ever
talk
about
is
"toilets,"
so
i
don't
mention
…
but
how
about
the
shower?
you
go
into
a
"shower,"
and
i
have
this
beautiful
head
of
"hair,"
i
need
a
lot
of
water.
i
need
water.
you
go
into
the
"shower,"
right?
you
turn
on
the
"water,"
"drip,"
"drip,"
drip.
i
called
the
"guy,"
"\"something"
wrong
with
"this?\""
"\"no,"
sir.
it's
just
the
"restrictor.\""
so
you're
in
there
five
times
longer
than
you're
supposed
to
be.
you
use
probably
more
water
and
it's
a
very
unpleasant
"experience,"
right?
so
we're
getting
rid
of
the
restrictors.
you're
going
to
have
full
shower
flow.
full
sink.
did
you
ever
go
to
the
faucet?
you
turn
on
the
faucet
to
wash
your
hands
and
it
turns
on
so
easy.
it's
like
"this,"
because
there's
zero
pressure
behind
it.
no
water.
you
go
like
"that,"
the
thing
flips
on.
whoa.
and
"then,"
"dung,"
dung.
these
people
are
crazy.
and
then
in
"california,"
this
"governor,"
who
has
no
clue
by
the
"way,"
he
has
no
clue.
governor
gavin
newsom.
he
sends
all
the
water
out
to
the
pacific
and
then
he
just
comes
up
…
i
don't
know
if
you
saw
this.
they
come
up
with
rules
and
regulations.
starting
"soon,"
if
you're
a
person
lives
in
"california,"
you
only
get
50
gallons
of
water.
"now,"
it
sounds
like
a
lot
of
"water,"
but
it's
not.
if
you
take
a
"shower,"
wash
your
hands
a
couple
of
times
a
day
…
it's
not.
then
it
goes
down
to
"47,"
"46,"
45.
can
you
imagine?
you
pay
the
highest
taxes
outside
of
new
"york,"
where
they're
not
doing
a
good
job
in
new
york.
they're
not
doing
good.
everyone's
leaving
new
york
for
other
environs
like
florida.
it's
not
good.
because
the
taxes
are
too
high.
governor
cuomo's
got
to
get
those
taxes
"down,"
got
to
get
them
"down,"
and
other
things
have
to
happen.
but
here's
gavin
newsom.
"so,"
gavin
"newsom,"
you
have
the
water
pouring
down
from
up
"north,"
millions
and
millions
of
gallons.
you
know
what
they
do
with
it?
they
divert
it
into
the
pacific
"ocean,"
because
they
have
…
we
must
be
in
wisconsin.
no.
millions
of
gallons
coming
down
from
the
north.
they
have
this
massive
valve.
you're
talking
about
a
"valve,"
this
is
a
serious
"valve,"
and
they
turn
it
and
it
…
because
they
have
a
"tiny,"
tiny
little
fish
that's
doing
very
poorly
with
or
without
the
water.
so
in
the
"meantime,"
if
you
own
a
home
on
beverly
"hills,"
they
scream
at
you
if
you
want
to
water
your
grass
a
little
"bit,"
right?
but
you
have
no
water
coming
in.
they
divert
millions
and
millions
of
gallons.
and
what
we've
just
done
for
the
people
of
california
is
we've
made
it
possible
on
a
federal
basis
that
they
don't
have
to
divert
all
that
water
anymore.
now
that's
only
good
for
"california,"
but
these
are
the
things
we
do.
and
now
the
last
one
is
we're
working
on
cars.
we're
making
them
less
expensive
and
safer.
we're
giving
them
a
tiny
little
bit
more
fuel
and
you're
going
to
save
on
average
"$3,500."
you're
going
to
have
a
heavier
"car,"
a
little
"bit,"
meaning
you'll
have
steel
instead
of
paper
mache
walls.
and
we're
getting
a
lot
of
good
response.
and
"environmentally,"
it's
"better,"
because
now
people
…
the
number
is
12.
from
12
years
"ago,"
with
the
old
gas
"guzzlers,"
they'll
all
be
trading
in
their
cars
to
get
the
new
"cars,"
which
they
don't
do
right
now.
so
it's
really
going
to
be
"something,"
and
we're
in
a
little
fight
with
california
over
that.
but
i
think
ultimately
we
win
that
one.
you'll
buy
a
better
"car,"
a
safer
"car,"
for
less
money.
not
a
bad
combination.
not
a
bad
thing.
to
lift
up
forgotten
communities
that
need
investment
the
"most,"
we've
created
opportunity
zones.
jobs
and
investment
are
now
pouring
into
120
newly
designated
opportunity
zones
right
here
in
wisconsin.
and
ron
johnson
helped
and
tim
scott
of
south
carolina
"helped,"
right?
they're
doing
great.
they
are
doing
good.
and
for
decades
politicians
ran
for
office
promising
to
defend
wisconsin
"workers,"
but
then
they
went
to
washington
and
lined
their
pockets
with
special
interest
cash
as
they
shipped
your
jobs
and
your
dreams
to
countries
thousands
of
miles
away.
countries
that
you've
never
even
heard
of.
globalist
politicians
lowered
our
economic
defenses
and
allowed
other
nations
to
rob
your
"factories,"
steal
your
farms.
by
the
"way,"
no
estate
tax
on
those
beautiful
farms.
we
got
rid
of
that.
so
"now,"
if
you
love
your
children
and
you
have
a
farm
or
a
small
business
or
small
"ranch,"
or
even
a
large
"ranch,"
you
have
no
estate
tax.
you
can
give
it
to
the
kids.
if
you
don't
love
your
children
…
anybody
in
here
does
not
love
their
children?
there
are
some.
come
"on,"
raise
your
hand.
there
are
some.
you
"know,"
they're
brats.
they're
little
brats.
they're
horrible
human
beings.
so
if
you're
one
of
"them,"
this
doesn't
help
"you,"
because
you'll
save
some
tax.
the
fact
"is,"
no
estate
tax
on
these
small
businesses
and
farms.
that's
a
tremendous
"thing,"
because
you
are
"dying,"
you
are
leaving
the
business
to
your
kids.
they
all
"said,"
"\"thank"
you
very
"much,"
daddy
and
"mommy,\""
and
then
they
went
out
and
mortgaged
the
hell
out
of
the
place
and
they
ended
up
losing
it
to
the
banks.
but
we
got
rid
of
the
estate
tax
on
small
farms
and
businesses
and
really
great
things.
little
stuff
like
that
we've
done
that
we
never
said
we
were
going
to
"do,"
but
these
people
were
ransacking
your
communities.

we
are

they

"dangerous,"
"violent,"

of

and
directly
onto
your

love

they're
so
great.

they
moved

but
ice
officers
in
this
region
of

arrested

"7,000"

so
you
have
"7,000"

including
those
charged

convicted
of
"murder,"
"burglary,"
"robbery,"

right
here
in

are
releasing
dangerous

who
"abuse,"
assault
and
threaten

last
"year,"
a
place
i
"like,"
the

released
an

criminal
with

for

over.

go
from

in
the
city
of
"madison,"
police
arrested
an
illegal
alien
for
sexual
assault.
after
authorities
released
"him,"
he
committed
violent
"battery,"
only
to
be
released
one
more
time.
they're
looking
for

again.
isn't
that
nice?
the
same
illegal
alien
was
then
arrested
for
a
third
time
in
september
and
charged
with
multiple
sexual
"assaults,"
including
sexual
assault
of
a
child.
now
that
criminal
is
once
again
in
wisconsin
jail
and
i
call
on
your
left
wing
officials
to
stop
the
madness
and
to
work
with

to
ensure
he
is
deported

him
out
of

democrats
stand
for
"crime,"
corruption
and
chaos.

stand
for

it's
true.
it's
true.
we
believe
wisconsin
should
be
a
sanctuary
for
law-abiding
"americans,"
not
for
criminal
aliens.
we
are
removing
these
illegal
criminals
and
gang
members
by
the
tens
of
thousands
and
we
will
not
let
them
back.
we
made
a

with

"mexico,"
where
they
accept
them

take

take

great.
it
helped
a
lot
when
we
were
paying
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
think
of
it.
i
just
"said,"
we're
not
paying
them
anymore.
all
of
a
sudden
they
"said,"
"\"we"
would

would
love
to
have
our

thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
"crossings,"
seven
straight
months
in
a
"row,"
and
we're
being
helped
by
our
new
100
miles
plus
of
wall.
illegal
crossings
are
down
78%
since
may
and
we
have
ended
catch
and
release.
that
was
a
tough
one.
our
very
big
and
very
powerful
border
wall
is
going
up
at
a
record
speed
and
we're
fully
financed
now.
isn't
that
nice?
that
wasn't
easy.
that
was
not
easy.
we're
adding
new
miles
every
week
and
we
are
on
track
to
soon
build
that
wall.
you're
going
to
have
a
wall
like
no
other.
it's
going
to
be
a
"powerful,"
terrific
wall.
and
walls
do
work.
i
hate
to
"say,"
remember
the
"democrats,"
"\"you"
don't
need
"walls.\""
oh
really?
"\"we"
need
"drones.\""
they
wanted
us
to
put
drones
flying
"around,"
taking
pictures
of
everybody.
"now,"
did
you
see
on
part
of
the
new
wall
two
days
"ago,"
illegal
aliens
with
drugs
on
their
back
were
climbing
the
wall.
they
got
to
the
top.
you
know
that
paddle
on
top
is
called
a
climb
resistor.
it's
very
slippery
and
very
"hot,"
very
"hot,"
and
they
got
stuck
on
the
wall.
they
couldn't
get
off
the
wall.
did
you
see
that?
i
was
watching
the
news.
i
was
surprised
that
the
fake
news
showed
it
and
i
"said,"
"\"isn't"
that
a
beautiful
"sight?\""
they
couldn't
get
over
the
wall.
couldn't
get
off.
they
had
to
get
the
fire
department
to
get
them
down.
do
you
believe
that?
30
feet
"up,"
that's
like
almost
a
four
story
building.
washington
democrats
have
never
been
more
extreme
than
they
are

they're
going
crazy.
they're

totally
loony.

about

about

all
of

won't
say
"it,"

the

and
everything
else.

are

they're

to

taking
their
cues
from

"aoc,"
all
these

liberal

are
pushing

of

would
strip

of

have

never

happen.

probably
change
their

before

is
why
i
don't

rather

these

are
sick.
but
they're
the
party
of
late
term

socialism
and
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
of
"course,"
honest
abe
"lincoln,"
right?
republicans
are
fighting
for
citizens
from
every
background
and
from
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
we
are
a
movement.
there's
a
movement
like
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
you
"know,"

mention

this
is
one
of
the
greatest
…
i
would
say
this.
this
is
the
greatest
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
really
believe
that.
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
i
"mean,"
there
have
been
some
great
movements
where
somebody
came
along
and
out
of
nowhere
won
the
state
of
new
"hampshire,"
won
"iowa,"
won
south
carolina
down
the
"way,"
won
a
state
some
place.
but
we
won
32
states.
there's
never
been
a
movement
like
"this,"
never
happened
before.
but
we're
a
movement
for
all
americans
who
believe
in
fairness
and
"justice,"
equality
and
"dignity,"
opportunity
and
safety.
we
are
a
big
tent
and
we
are
a
big
party
of
big
ideas
for
the
future.
that's
why
african
americans
are
joining
the
republican
party
like
nobody
ever
thought
even
possible.
they
love
us
and
we
love
them.
and
to
give
former
prisoners
a
second
chance
at
"life,"
we
passed.
it
was
"us,"
not
the
democrats.
they
came
to
"me,"
they
wanted
"help,"
i
gave
them
help.
i
got
it
done.
i
called
republicans
that
maybe
wouldn't
have
been
so
"inclined,"
some
of
them.
some
of
them
very
much
inclined.
some
of
them
very
conservative
were
very
much
inclined.
but
i
got
the
people
that
we
needed.
obama
couldn't
do
it.
bush
couldn't
do
it.
nobody
could
do
it.
i
got
it
"approved,"
and
from
the
day
it
was
"approved,"
i
got
no
"thanks,"
i
got
no
credit.
and
that's
"okay,"
because
you
"know,"
right?
but
we
passed
bi-partisan
criminal
justice
reform
and
that's
helped
so
many
people.
i
"mean,"
you
know
the
story
of
alice
johnson.
you
know
so
many
different
stories.
it's
helped
so
many
"people,"
especially
in
the

it's

a

watched
as

apologized
for

now
you
have
a

is
standing
up

we
are
standing
up

was

don't
"know,"

the

it
was
so
important.
i
really
believe
that
this

maybe
in
its
own

will
be
just
as
important.
i
can't
say
"more,"

just

we
save

i
have
found
out

have
become
the

i
had
no

will
lift

together
we
will
elect

put

are
giving
us
their
finest?
"\"oh,"
let's
give
them

put
them
"in.\""
these
people
are
crazy
to
allow
this
to
"happen,"
so
we're
stopping
it
all.
but
ending
catch
and
release
was
a
very
big
"thing,"
and
we
did
that
with
no
democrat
help.
they
wouldn't
do
it.
it's
called
loopholes.
who
wouldn't
want
to
end
loopholes?
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
that
beautiful
"phrase,"
"\"made"

"usa.\""
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in

"medicine,"
finding

cures
for
childhood
cancer

ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
in

than
10

who
would've
thought
that?
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear

and
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for

sacred

bind

we
"support,"
protect

defend
the

with
the
incredible
heroes
of

in

we
believe
that
faith

all
i
can
say
is
that

doesn't
get

they?
they
don't

they
just
don't

hello
"charleston,"
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
back
in
the
great
state
of
south
carolina
with
thousands
of
hardworking
american
patriots
who
believe
in
"faith,"
"family,"
"god,"
and

thank
you.
it's
a
phenomenal
"crowd,"
only
topped
by
the
number
of
people
outside
that
didn't
get
in.
if
anybody
would
like
to
give
up
where
you're
standing
or
your

please
raise
your

all
right.
then
let's
"begin,"
right?
thank
you
all
very
much
though.
this
is
great.
"no,"
they
don't
get
it.
down
the
"road,"
they
have
a
rally
for
one
of
the
people
that
are
going
to
be
running
tomorrow.
they're
trying
to
get
to
a
"hundred,"
but
they're
not
going
to
make
it.
so
i
think
they're
going
to
set
up
a
round
table.
"well,"
that's
what
they
do.
so
people
want
to
go
to
a
"rally,"
they
end
up
sitting
at
a
round
table
talking
about
their
definition
of
impeachment.

"no,"
it's
crazy.
crazy!
it's
a
crazy
deal.
"no,"
the
fake
news
"media,"
they've
been
trying
to
figure
this
out
for
years.
they
still
don't

though.
they
don't
get
it.
look
at
all
of

look
at
all
of

that's
a
lot
of

that's
a
lot
of
"cameras,"
lindsey

that's
a
lot
of…
they
heard
you
guys
were
here.
they
heard

that
lindsey
was

that…
and
they
"said,"
"\"we're"
not
going

but
when
we
heard
those
two
guys
plus
our
great
"congressmen,"
they're
"here,"
great
congressmen.
but
this
is
an
incredible
time
for
our
nation.
we're
thrilled
to
be
in
the
midst
of
what
we
call
the
great
american
comeback
and
that's
what
it
is.
jobs
are
"booming,"
incomes
are
"soaring,"
factories
are
"returning,"
poverty
is
"plummeting,"
confidence
is
"surging,"
and
we
have
completely
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
the
united
states
military.
our
country
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
we
are
"stronger,"
we
are
"better,"
but
while
we
are
building
a
great
"future,"
the
radical
left
democrats
in
washington
are
trying
to
burn
it
all
down.
they
have
spent
the
last
three
"years,"
and
i
can
even
go
further
than
"that,"
three
years
since
the
"election,"
but
we
go
before
the
"election,"
working
to
erase
your
ballots
and
overthrow
our
democracy.
but
with
your
"help,"
we
have
exposed
the
far
left's
corruption
and
defeated
their
sinister
schemes
and
let's
see
what
happens
in
the
coming
months.
let's
watch.
let's
just
watch.
very
dishonest
people.
now
the
democrats
are
politicizing
the
"coronavirus,"
you
know
that
right?
"coronavirus,"
they're
politicizing
it.
we
did
one
of
the
great
jobs.
you
"say,"
"\"how's"
president
trump
"doing?\""
they
"go,"
"\"oh,"
not
"good,"
not
"good.\""
they
have
no
clue.
they
don't
have
any
clue.
they
can't
even
count
their
votes
in
iowa.
they
can't
even
count.
"no,"
they
can't.
they
can't
count
their
votes.
one
of
my
people
came
up
to
me
and
"said,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
they
tried
to
beat
you
on
"russia,"
"russia,"
"russia.\""
that
didn't
work
out
too
well.
they
couldn't
do
it.
they
tried
the
impeachment
hoax.
that
was
on
a
perfect
conversation.
they
tried
anything.
they
tried
it
over
and
over.
they'd
been
doing
it
since
you
got
in.
it's
all
turning.
they
lost.
it's
all
turning.
think
of
it.
think
of
it.
and
this
is
their
new
hoax.
but
we
did
something
that's
been
pretty
amazing.
we
have
15
people
in
this
massive
country
and
because
of
the
fact
that
we
went
early.
we
went
"early,"
we
could
have
had
a
lot
more
than
that.
we're
doing
great.
our
country
is
doing
so
great.
we
are
so
unified.
we
are
so
unified.
the
republican
party
has
never
ever
been
unified
like
it
is
now.
there
has
never
been
a
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country
like
we
have
now.
never
been
a
movement.
so
a
statistic
that
we
want
to
talk
"about,"
go
ahead.
say
usa.
it's
okay.
usa.
so
a
number
that
nobody
heard
"of,"
that
i
heard
of
recently
and
i
was
shocked
to
hear
"it,"
"35,000"
people
on
average
die
each
year
from
the
flu.
did
anyone
know
that?
"35,000,"
that's
a
lot
of
people.
it
could
go
to
"100,000,"
it
could
be
"27,000."
they
say
usually
a
minimum
of
"27,"
goes
up
to
"100,000"
people
a
year
die.
and
so
far
we
have
lost
nobody
to
coronavirus
in
the
united
states.
nobody.
and
it
doesn't
mean
we
won't
and
we
are

it
doesn't
mean
we
"won't,"

think
of
it.

hear

you
wonder
the

never
do

they
never

you
can
hear
it
because
when
you
hear

that's
not

that's
not

thank
you.
democrats
will
only
say
horrible
things
even
though
they
know
we're
doing
a
great
job.
we're
doing
a
great
job
with
what
we
have
to
work
with.
it's
incredible.
the
democrats
want
us
to
fail
so
badly.
even
if
their
"actions,"
and
you
take
a
"look,"
hurt
the
people
of
this
"country,"
they'll
hurt
the
people
"themselves,"
their
"wealth,"
their
everything.
they're
willing
to
hurt
our
country
in
order
to
say
"bad,"
even
if
they
know
it's
not
so.
we
made
an
unbelievable
deal
with
"mexico,"
with
"canada,"
with
"china,"
with
south
"korea,"
with
japan.
and
if
you
put
a
microphone
with
these
people
back
there
like
the
academy
awards
used
to
"be,"
not
anymore.
best
movie
of
the
year.
it's
made
in
south
korea.
what's
that
all
about?
i'm
waiting
to
see
the
best
movie
of
the
year-
and
it's
made…
he
"said,"
"\"it's"
"garbage.\""
only
in
south
carolina
can
you
say
that.
only
in
south
carolina.
you're
going
to
get
us
in
trouble.
"no,"
i'm
just
repeating
what
he
said
for
the
fake
news.
"no,"
but
seriously
the
academy
awards
has
gone
"way,"
way
down
in
ratings.
do
you
know
why?
because
they
started
attacking
us
and
we
don't
believe
in
it
anymore.
that's
why.
"no,"
but
they
had
the
best
movie
of
the
year
made
in
south
korea.
they
make
enough
stuff
for
"us,"
right?
and
they're
good.
they're
our
friends.
take
advantage
of
"us,"
that's
okay.
not
so
much
anymore.
we
are
"really,"
you
take
a
"look,"
magnificently
organized
with
the
best
professionals
in
the
world.
we're
prepared
for
the
absolute
worst.
you
have
to
be
prepared
for
the
"worst,"
but
hopefully
it
will
all
amount
to
very
little.
that's
why
i
tell
you
when
we
have
the
flu
with
"35,000"
people
and
this
one
we
have
to
take
it
"very,"
very
seriously.
that's
what
we're
doing.
we
are
preparing
for
the
worst.
my
administration
has
taken
the
most
aggressive
action
in
modern
history
to
prevent
the
spread
of
this
illness
in
the
united
states.
we
are
ready.
we
are
ready.
totally
ready.
on
january
"31st,"
i
ordered
the
suspension
of
foreign
nationals
who
have
recently
been
in
china
from
entering
the
united
states.
an
action
which
the
democrats
loudly
criticized
and
protested
and
now
everybody's
complimenting
me
"saying,"
"\"thank"
you
very
much.
you
were
100%
"correct.\""
could've
been
a
whole
different
story.
but
i
"say,"
so
let's
get
this
right.
a
virus
starts
in
"china,"
bleeds
its
way
into
various
countries
all
around
the
"world,"
doesn't
spread
widely
at
all
in
the
united
states
because
of
the
early
actions
that
myself
and
my
administration
took
against
a
lot
of
other
"wishes,"
and
the
democrats'
single
talking
"point,"
and
you
see
"it,"
is
that
it's
donald
trump's
"fault,"
right?
it's
donald
trump's
fault.
"no,"
just
things
that
happened.
but
you
know
what
this
does
show
you?
things
happen.
whoever
thought
of
this
two
weeks
ago?
who
would've
thought
this
could
be
going
on
four
weeks
ago?
you
wouldn't.
but
things
happen
in
life
and
you
have
to
be
prepared
and
you
have
to
be
flexible
and
you
have
to
be
able
to
go
out
and
get
it.
and
my
guys
that
we
have
the
best
professionals
in
the
"world,"
the
best
in
the
world
and
we
are
so
ready.
at
the
same
time
that
i
initiated
the
first
federally
mandated
quarantine
in
over
50
years.
we
had
a
quarantine
some
people.
they
weren't
"happy,"
they
weren't
happy
about
it.
i
want
to
tell
you
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
not
so
"happy,"
but
after
two
weeks
they
got
happy.
you
know
who
got
happy?
the
people
around
them
got
happy.
that's
who
got
happy.
i
also
created
a
white
house
virus
task
force.
it's
a
big
"thing,"
a
virus
task
force.
i
requested
2.5
billion
dollars
to
ensure
we
have
the
resources
we
need.
the
democrats
"said,"
"\"that's"
terrible.
he's
doing
the
wrong
thing.
he
needs
eight
and
a
half
"billion,"
not
two
and
a
"half.\""
i've
never
had
that
before.
i
ask
for
two
and
a
"half,"
they
want
to
give
me
eight
and
a
"half,"
so
i
"said,"
"\"i'll"
take
"it.\""
does
that
make
me
a
bad…
i'll
take
it.
i'll
take
it.
i
never
had
that
before.
i
never
had
it.
we
want
two
and
a
half
million.
that's
plenty.
we
demand
you
take
eight
and
a
half.
he
doesn't
know
what
he's
doing.
we
want
eight
and
a
half.
these
people
are
crazy.
we
must
understand
that
border
security
is
also
health
security.
and
you've
all
seen
the
wall
has
gone
up
like
magic.
it's
gone
up
like
magic.
you
think
that
was
an
easy
one?
that
was
not
an
easy
one.
it's
going
up
great
and
we're
up
now
132
miles
and
this
is
the
exact
wall
that
border
"security,"
"water,"
everything.
this
is
everything
they
"wanted,"
132
miles
already.
we'll
have
500
miles
built
by
very
early
next
year
sometime.
one
of
the
reasons
the
numbers
are
so
good.
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
the
infection
and
those
carrying
the
infection
from
entering
our
country.
we
have
no
choice.
whether
it's
the
virus
that
we're
talking
about
or
many
other
public
health
"threats,"
the
democrat
policy
of
open
borders
is
a
direct
threat
to
the
health
and
wellbeing
of
all
americans.
now
you
see
it
with
the
"coronavirus,"
you
see
it.
you
see
it
with
the
coronavirus.
you
see
that.
when
you
have
this
virus
or
any
other
virus
or
any
other
problem
coming
"in,"
it's
not
the
only
thing
that
comes
in
through
the
border.
and
we're
setting
records
now
at
the
border.
we're
setting
records.
and
now
just
using
"this,"
so
"important,"
right?
so
important.
i'm
doing
well
in
the
polls
despite
the
worst
fake
news
and
worst
presidential
harassment
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
we've
got
phenomenal
numbers.
"no,"
it's
true.
the
worst
presidential
harassment
in
history.
we
had
a
great
event
"yesterday,"
an
event
that
was
so
"beautiful,"
young
african
american
leaders.
one
of
the
things
i
asked
"them,"
and
i've
been
thinking
about
this
for
a
long
time…
and
great
"people,"
great
people.
some
of
them
are
here
tonight.
do
you
like
the
name
african
american
or
black?
and
they
"said,"
"\"black!\""
all
at
the
same
time.
"no,"
true.
i
tell
you.
because
you
"say,"
"\"african"
american
or
"black?\""
and
they
said
almost
"immediately,"
"\"black.\""
but
we
had
an
incredible
group
of
people
and
what
happened
is
nbc…
it
was
such
a
love
fest.
it
was
so
incredible.
it
went
on
for
45
minutes.
it
was
a
love
fest.
it
was
incredible.
nbc
turned
down…
there
they
are
right
there.
they
turned
down…
"comcast,"
which
owns
nbc…
actually
"nbc,"
i
"think,"
we
call
it
"msdnc,"
right?
msdnc.
but
nbc
i
think
is
worse
than
cnn.
i
actually
do.
and
"comcast,"
a
company
that
spends
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
on
their
image…
i'll
do
everything
possible
to
destroy
their
image
because
they
are
terrible.
they
are
terrible.
they're
a
terrible
group
of
people.
and
they
paid
me
a
fortune
for
years
for
the
apprentice.
they
paid
me
a
fortune.
and
when
i
left
the
"show,"
it
was
doing
great.
when
i
left
the
"show,"
14
"seasons,"
think
of
"that,"
they
got
a
big
movie
star.
i
won't
tell
you
his
name.
nobody
would
know.
actually
nobody
will
know
his
name
because
he
was
on
for
such
a
short
period
of
time.
but
the
show
went
down
the
tubes
very
quickly
after
they
had
trump.
but
the
country
in
five
years
from
"now,"
of
course
you
want
to
upset
"them,"
five
years
or
nine
years
or
13
years.
or
18
years!
10
more
years.
nah.
"oh,"
they
go
crazy
when
you
say
it.
when
you
say
to
them
five
more
"years,"
so
it's
"five,"
but
you
then
say
maybe
"nine,"
maybe
"13,"
maybe
"17,"
maybe
"21,"
or
"not,"
maybe
21.
let's
do
this.
let's
term
limit
ourselves
at
25
years.
no
more
than
25
years.
no
more.
okay.
they'll
pass
something
in
the
senate.
"tim,"
pass
it
in
the
senate
with
"lindsey,"
a
25
year
term
limit
please.
07.
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
with
these
vile
"hoaxes,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
"border,"
and
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
we
added
another
"225,000"
jobs
last
month
alone.
and
that
makes
seven
million
jobs
since
our
"election,"
seven
million.
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
great
state
of
south
carolina.
you
ever
hear
of
that
place?
now
sleepy
joe
would
"say,"
"\"the"
unemployment
rate
in
the
great
state
of
"ohio…\""
"no,"
no.
you're
in
south
carolina.
joe!
"joe,"
you're
in
south
carolina.
come
up.
you
ever
see
the
guy
with
the
"note,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
it's
south
carolina!
it's
not
"ohio.\""
okay.
then
he
"goes,"
"\"all"
"right,"
iowa.
did
you
say
"iowa?\""
no.
no.
they
did
that
seven
times.
if
i
did
that
"once,"
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
"road,"
right?
be
the
end
of
the
road.
they'd
say
trump
has
lost
it.
they
like
to
say
that
"anyway,"
i
guess
though.
these
people
are
bad
people.
"now,"
sleepy
joe.
"well,"
he's
running
tomorrow.
"no,"
but
could
you
imagine
if
i
said
just
a
small
fraction
of
the
mistakes
he
"makes,"
which
are
unbelievable?
every
speech.
i
actually
said
the
other
"night,"
i
was
watching
him
when
he
said
about
half
the
population
wiped
out
with
guns.
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
horrible
thing.
that's
the
end
of
his
evening.
that's
the
end
of
his
political
"career.\""
and
then
after
the
"debate,"
they're
revealing
him
and
they
"said,"
"\"joe"
biden
had
a
great
night
last
"night.\""
i
don't
get
"it,"
tim.
the
unemployment
rate
here
in
south
carolina
has
fallen
to
"2.3%,"
the
lowest
rate
in
your
state's
history.
the
lowest
rate
in
all
of
america.
it's
the
lowest
rate
in
all
of
america.
i
said
to
a
friend
of
"mine,"
a
"democrat,"
"\"how's"
the
race
going
tomorrow?
who's
going
to
"win?\""
and
he
"says,"
"\"mr."
"president…\""
"no,"
it's
very
interesting.
he
said
something.
this
guy's
a
real
political
pro
"too,"
in
all
"fairness,"
even
though
he's
a
democrat.
but
i
"said,"
"\"who's"
going
to
"win?\""
he
"said,"
"\"honestly,"
"sir,"
it
doesn't
matter.
you
are
so
far
ahead
in
south
carolina
that
it's
"meaningless.\""
meaningless.
that's
what
they
say.
and
in
north
carolina
too.
in
north
"carolina,"
bunch
of
losers.
the
good
citizens
of
south
carolina
have
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
extremism
of
the
democrat
candidates.
whether
it's
this
character
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
him.
i'd
never
heard
it.
i
thought
i
knew
all
the
wealthy
people.
this
guy
"tom,"
mr.
"impeachment,"
how
did
that
work
"out,"
tom
"hey,"
he
spent
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
in
"iowa,"
right?
millions.
he
got
less
than
1%.
he
got
one
third
of
1%.
i
wrote
a
little
note.
did
you
see
it?
it
"said,"
"\"tom,"
it's
not
so
easy
doing
what
i
did.
is
"it?\""
not
so
easy.
not
so
easy.
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
mini
mike.
he's
in
there
for
a
fortune.
he
wished
he
never
started.
mini
"mike,"
he
wished
he
never
started.
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
trump
can
do
it.
i'm
going
to
do
it
"too.\""
unfortunately
it's
not
working
out
too
well.
was
that
the
worst
debate
performance
in
history?
they
had
a
big
audience.
everybody
wanted
to
see
whether
or
not
he
was
good
at
what
we're
supposed
to
be
doing
up
here.
he
turned
out
to
be
a
total
catastrophe.
35
million
"people,"
can
you
believe
that?
that's
a
big
audience.
very
big.
and
what
a
killer.
but
this
guy
"steyer,"
he
spends
all
this
money.
he's
not
that
wealthy.
he
spends
all
of
this
money
and
you
shouldn't
waste
your
vote
on
him
tomorrow.
i
have
to
be
honest.
by
the
"way,"
are
the
republicans
allowed
to
vote
anyway
even
though…
are
you
ready?
you
ready?
let's
do
it
together.
i
assume
this
is
okay
from
a
campaign
finance
"standpoint,"
i
assume.
"lindsey,"
"tim,"
our
great
"congressmen,"
are
we
allowed
to
do
this?
so
am
i
allowed
to
request…
first
we-
"congressman,"
are
we
allowed
to
do
this?
am
i
allowed
to
request
…
"first,"
we
have
to
figure
out
who
would
be
the
weakest
candidate
against
president
trump.
and
then
if
it's
"legal,"
i
always
say
if
it's
permissible
by
"law,"
because
they
have
so
many
little
booby
"traps,"
but
they
only
like
getting
the
republicans.
democrats
"skirt,"
right?
but
we'll
see
what
happens
about
that.
the
democrats.
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
"lindsey,"
"tim,"
you're
pros.
these
are
two
of
the
greatest
guys
i
know.
so
let
me
ask
you
this.
so
i
don't
know
what
the
record
attendance
is
in
this
"arena,"
but
i
was
told
that
we
broke
it
by
a
lot.
and
you
got
the
people
outside.
are
we
allowed
to
tell
them
who
we
would
like
them
to
vote
for?
because
you're
allowed
to
skip.
all
"right,"
so
wait
a
"minute,"
let's
do
a
poll.
we
do
this
for
the
fake
news
back
there.
ready?
who
would
be
the
best
candidate
for
us?
not
for
them.
we're
ready.
ready?
so
let's
go
through
them
just
quickly.
we
won't
include
steyer
because
he's
a
loser.
he's
"out,"
okay?
we
won't
include
him.
who
would
be
the
best?
this
is
a
real
poll.
this
isn't
one
of
those
fake
polls
taken
by
…
in
all
"fairness,"
i
love
"you,"
"fox,"
taken
by
"fox,"
the
worst
pollster.
this
guy
…
this
pollster
hates
trump's
guts.
i
was
losing
the
last
election
by
a
fortune.
they
"said,"
"\"he"
did
great
with
"women.\""
everything
was
wrong.
and
they
never
replaced
this
guy.
but
watch
this.
you
ready?
so
first
we'll
go
…
let's
say
sleepy
"joe,"
right?
right?
then
we'll
go
crazy
bernie.
then
we'll
go
mini
mike.
i
think
he's
out
of
it.
should
we
include
mini
mike
or
not?
mini
mike
is
gone.
mini
mike
is
gone.
i
think
he's
gone.
he
doesn't
have
a
chance.
so
let's
not
talk
…
and
he's
not
in
your
election
"anyways,"
so
let's
forget.
so
mini
"mike,"
i
hear
mini
"mike,"
by
the
"way,"
has
left.
he's
basically
given
up.
that's
what
i
hear.
he
gave
up.
he
gave
up.
"now,"
i
hope
what
i
just
said
keeps
him
in.
you
"know,"
he's
the
kind
of
a
"guy,"
he'll
stay
in
"because,"
"\"i"
don't
want
to
be
"wrong.\""
"mike,"
it's
time
to
go
home.
go
"home,"
"mike,"
and
enjoy
your
life.
go
home
and
spend
some
money
on
something
horrible
to
people.
they
"said,"
"\"she's"
not
"dumb,"
but
she's
just
damn
mean.
we
can't
vote
for
"her.\""
she's
a
mean
one.
she
is
mean.
so
"pocahontas,"
should
we
leave
her
in
or
out?
how
about
klobuchar?
not
going
to
happen.
so
really
we're
down
to
two
"candidates,"
right?
sleepy
joe
biden
and
crazy
bernie.
so
this
is
a
poll.
i
guarantee
you
this.
as
much
as
they
hate
"me,"
they
hate
me.
they're
going
to
put
this
all
over
the
place.
we
have
a
poll
of
like
"30,000"
people
inside
and
out.
they're
doing
it
"outside,"
too.
we
have
a
poll.
are
you
ready?
who
do
i
…
so
in
other
"words,"
who's
the
weaker
of
the
two?
i'm
not
interested
in
who
does
better.
"no,"
no.
i'm
not
interested
…
wait.
ready?
in
other
"words,"
who
do
i
want
to
run
against?
meaning
…
very
simple.
we
put
it
into
"nice,"
simple
language.
who
the
hell
is
easier
to
beat?
so
who
is
easier
for
us?
not
me.
for
us
to
beat.
ready?
crazy
bernie?
or
sleepy
joe?
i
don't
know.
i
think
maybe
a
crazy
bernie
has
it
a
little
bit.
once
more
just
quick.
ready?
he
"said,"
"\"it"
doesn't
"matter,"
you'll
beat
them
"all.\""
i
hope
so.
i
hope
so.
so
who
is
easier
to
"beat,"
crazy
bernie
or
sleepy
joe?
they
think
bernie's
easier
to
beat.
they
think
bernie's
easier
to
beat.
so
whether
it's
bernie
sanders'
plan
to
eliminate
private
"healthcare,"
elizabeth
warren's
plan.
i
told
you
that
i
had
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
"her,"
even
though
i
have
none.
i
have
none.
zero.
i
have
none.
i
have
none.
i
said
i
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
she
has.
and
she
choked.
she
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
show.
i'm
going
to
"show.\""
she
hired
this
company
and
they
went
out
and
did
a
blood
test.
"1,024th,"
right?
so
that
means
i
probably
one
somewhere
down
the
line
a
million
years
ago.
i'm
telling
"you,"
that
was
horrible.
she
choked.
we
don't
want
a
person
to
win
that
chokes.
we
don't
want
to
choke
"artist,"
right?
one
thing
you
will
say
about
"me,"
i'm
not
a
choker.
with
all
these
people
for
"years,"
they're
after
me
years.
we
can't
have
chokers.
we
can't
have
chokers
as
your
president.
so
elizabeth
warren's
plan
to
eliminate
america's
borders.
that's
what
she
would
…
or
mini
mike's
plan
to
eliminate
your
second
amendment
and
take
away
your
guns.
how
about
that?
mini
mike
wants
to
take
away
your
guns.
the
insanity
of
the
democrat
party
is
why
millions
of
registered
democrat
voters
are
joining
our
movement.
they
are
joining
our
great
new
republican
party.
this
"november,"
we
are
going
to
take
back
the
house.
we
are
going
to
hold
the
"senate,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
white
house.
i
wonder
what
they
say
when
they
go
down
the
road
and
they
see
these
groups
of
200
people.
seriously.
i
wonder
what
they
say.
they
never
talk
about
it.
they'll
"say,"
"\"joe"
biden
had
a
fabulous
crowd
"today.\""
fabulous.
so
fabulous
that
there's
like
five
people.
and
they'll
leave
and
they'll
"say,"
"\"president"
trump
had
a
smattering
of
"applause.\""
smattering.
they
use
the
word
smattering
a
lot.
this
is
not
…
let's
let
them
hear
it.
this
is
not
a
…
this
is
a
big
…
this
is
not
a
smattering.
it's
not
a
smattering.
turn
the
cameras.
that's
not
a
smattering.
that
is
not
a
smattering.
i
hate
it.
they
say
donald
trump
…
in
"india,"
i
hate
to
say
this
to
"you,"
but
…
so
they
actually
have
"129,000"
seat
stadium.
did
you
see
it?
the
place
was
"packed,"
and
they
did
better
than
most.
they
gave
me
credit
for
"100,000."
that
was
not
bad.
it's
129.
the
stadium
holds
100.
they
had
a
field
that's
about
three
times
…
it's
cricket.
it's
the
biggest
stadium.
and
they
had
129.
i
was
with
the
prime
minister
of
"india,"
modi.
great
"guy,"
loved
by
the
people
of
india.
and
we
had
an
amazing
thing.
and
i
went
"in,"
and
here's
the
problem.
this
is
a
big
crowd.
and
normally
i
like
talking
about
my
crowds
because
i
get
the
crowds
like
"nobody,"
but
i
just
got
back
from
140
or
50
or
"60,000"
people
and
now
i'm
coming
here.
what
does
this
place
"hold,"
15?
it's
hard
to
be
enthused.
you
understand
that?
i
may
never
be
excited
again
about
a
crowd
after
going
to
india.
think
of
"this,"
they
have
1.5
billion
people.
we
have
"350,"
so
we're
doing
pretty
"well,"
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
but
i
love
this
"crowd,"
and
i
love
that
crowd
too.
tell
you
they
have
a
great
love
for
…
they
have
a
great
love.
they
have
a
great
"leader,"
and
they
have
a
great
love
for
the
people
of
this
country.
that
was
really
a
worthwhile
trip.
with
us
tonight
are
both
of
your
incredible
us
senators.
two
incredible
"friends,"
two
warriors.
senator
lindsey
graham
and
senator
tim
"scott,"
come
up
here.
and
by
the
"way,"
tim's
incredible
mother
is
right
here
in
the
front
row.
as
they're
doing
"that,"
they
got
this
big
…
i
was
going
to
almost
do
a
poll
on
the
two
of
"them,"
but
we're
not
doing
that.
but
lindsey
is
a
true
fighter
for
south
carolina.
loves
your
state.
and
as
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
…
you
know
"that,"
right?
he's
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
so
important.
so
important.
senator
graham
has
been
leading
the
charge
to
help
us
confirm
a
record
number
of
judges
to
uphold
the
constitution
as
written.
lindsey
was
"amazing,"
you
"remember,"
for
justice
brett
kavanaugh?
remember
how
badly
he
…
great
"job,"
lindsey.
great
"job,"
man.
thank
you.
senator
scott
is
a
leading
superstar.
he's
a
superstar.
but
he
is
a
leader
in
lowering
healthcare
costs
like
nobody
has
done
it.
people
don't
"know,"
but
in
the
last
"year,"
prescription
drug
prices
came
down
for
the
first
time
in
51
years.
and
that
was
with
no
democrat
help.
if
we
had
the
"help,"
we
could
lower
it
by
50%.
but
we'll
get
their
help.
one
of
these
"days,"
they're
going
to
get
smart.
senator
scott
provides
world
class
care
for
our
veterans.
what
he's
done
for
our
veterans
is
incredible.
and
bringing
investment
to
distressed
communities
across
our
country
through
opportunity
"zones,"
including
135
right
here
in
south
carolina.
that's
what
it
is.
tim
scott
came
to
my
office
with
an
idea.
he
"said,"
"\"opportunity"
"zone.\""
i
"said,"
"\"tim,"
what
the
hell
is
"that?\""
what
is
it?
"right,"
tim?
and
he
went
through
a
whole
big
thing
and
i
"said,"
"\"this"
maybe
could
"work,\""
and
we
tried
it.
it
is
an
incredible
"success,"
and
what
he's
done
for
this
country
is
incredible.
it's
incredible.
lindsey.
we'll
start
with
lindsey.
say
a
few
"words,"
please.
thank
you.
"well,"
that
was
quite
a
"display,"
wasn't
it?
now
there's
a
lot
of
love
in
this
room.
a
lot
of
people
say
to
"me,"
friends
of
"mine,"
they've
very
successful.
they'll
"say,"
"\"how"
do
you
speak
in
front
of
"25,000"
people
and
"10,000"
people
and
all
of
"this?\""
you
know
why?
there's
such
love
in
the
room
it's
easy.
"no,"
it's
true.
there
is
such
…
i
"explained,"
they
don't
understand
"it,"
because
they're
not
for
doing
"that,"
but
i
say
there
is
such
unbelievable
love
in
the
room
that
it's
easy
to
do.
very
easy.
right?
it's
sort
of
easy
to
do.
we're
also
thrilled
to
be
joined
by
many
more
great

i
introduce

i'll
just
say

there

hard.
he's

of

they're
both
the
highest
awards.
one
"civilian,"
one
is

i
always
say
getting
the
presidential
medal
of
freedom
is
much
less
painful
because
when
i
read
them
"off,"
i'll
read

with

maybe
i
could
ask
our
"governor,"
our
great
governor
of
this
incredible

to
say
a
few
words.
"please,"

you

virtually
every
democrat
candidate
has
declared
their
unlimited
support
for
extreme
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from

womb
right
up
until
the
very

that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
late
term
abortion
of
"babies,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
of

is
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"

"socialism,"
blatant
"corruption,"
and
the
total
obliteration

proudly
fighting

right
here

want
to
give
school
choice
to
every
child
in

needs

came
up.

needed

called

called

so
great

called

i
gave
it

i
got

it
was

get

i
signed

called

about

but
while
we're
creating

and
killing
"terrorists,"
the
democrat
party
has
gone
completely
insane.
the
radical
left
is
determined
to
transform
america
into
a
country
you
would
not
recognize.
we
are
the
ones
standing
in
their
"way,"
and
we
will
never
get
out
of
their
way.
it
will
be
easy.
from
even
before
we
won
the
"election,"
the
far-left
democrats
and
the
fake
news
media
right
back
there…
look
at
all
of
"them,"
oh.
it's
too
bad
we
get
such
good
ratings
because
if
we
"didn't,"
they
wouldn't
be
here.
look
at
how
many.
it's
like
the
academy
awards
before
it
failed.
right?
and
you
know
why
it
failed?
because
they
disrespected
us.
but
the
media
and
the
democrats
have
been
engaged
in
a
corrupt
"partnership,"
trying
to
impose
their
will
and
to
thwart
american
democracy
by
any
means
necessary.
you
see
what's
going
on.
"first,"
they
engineered
the
russia
hoax.
that
was
a
total
"hoax,"
the
single
greatest
lies
ever
foisted
upon
the
american
people.
then
the
mueller
witch
"hunt,"
it
never
ended.
with
18
angry
democrats
and
an
unlimited
"budget,"
let's
go
get
him.
that
didn't
work
out
too
"well,"
did
it?
that
fizzled.
and
a
lot
of
bad
people
along
the
way.
and
now
corrupt
"politicians,"
nancy
pelosi-
…
and
shifty
adam
"schiff,"
shifty.
and
the
media
are
continuing
with
the
deranged
impeachment
witch
hunt.
this
is
one
i
never
thought
i'd
be
involved
in.
the
word
impeachment…
to
"me,"
it's
a
dirty
"word,"
not
a
good
word.
totally
phony
deal.
they
know
it.
everybody
knows
"it,"
and
that's
why
we've
never
had
greater
support
than
we
have
right
now.
it's
true.
and
if
you
think
you
have
a
lot
of
people
in
this
"room,"
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
outside.
you'll
see
a
lot
more
people
trying
to
get
in.
so
if
anybody
wants
to
give
up
your
"seat,"
please
just
walk
out.
anybody
want
to
leave?
because
there
really
is.
there's
no
place
better
to
have
a
"rally,"
to
have
a
good
"time,"
and
to
"also,"
at
the
same
"time,"
be
very
serious
than
at
a
trump
"rally,"
especially
on
friday
night
in
mississippi.
we
could
have
done
this
one
on
monday
night.
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
do
"friday.\""
right?
"yesterday,"
the
democrats
voted
to
potentially
nullify
the
votes
of
63
million
"americans,"
disgracing
themselves
and
bringing
shame
upon
the
house
of
representatives.
they've
been
plotting
to
overthrow
the
election
since
the
moment
i
won.
but
the
people
here
that
are
highly
"sophisticated,"
"though,"
long
before
i
won.
19
minutes
after
i
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
the
horrible
"newspaper,"
"fake,"
"fake,"
fake
washington
"post,"
"declared,"
"\"the"
campaign
to
impeach
president
trump
has
just
"begun.\""
at
least
they
gave
us
19
minutes.
yesterday's
vote
by
the
radical
democrats
is
an
attack
on
democracy
itself.
but
i'll
tell
"you,"
the
republicans
are
really
"strong,"
the
strongest
i've
ever
seen
"them,"
the
most
unified
i've
ever
seen
them.
right?
the
most
unified
i've
ever
seen
them.
the
american
people
are
fed
up
with
democrat
"lies,"
"hoaxes,"
and
extremism.
the
democrats'
outrageous
conduct
has
created
an
angry
majority
that
will
vote
many
do-nothing
democrats
out
of
office
in
2020.
make
no
mistake.
they
are
coming
after
the
republican
party
and
me
because
i'm
fighting
for
you.
they
don't
like
it.
this
is
different.
they've
never
had
anything
like
this.
"well,"
they've
never
had
an
election
like
2016
"either,"
have
they?
they
never
have.
they've
never
quite
figured
it
out.
you're
the
man.
and
they
know
they
can't
"win,"
so
let's
try
and
impeach
him.
how
about
that
crazy
"representative,"
al
"green,"
right?
"\"you"
"know,"
we
got
to
impeach
him
because
we
can't
beat
"him.\""
i
don't
think
so.
right?
i
don't
think
so.
al
"green,"
he's
another
beauty.
the
"democrats,"
the
"media,"
and
the
deep
state
are
desperate
to
stop
us.
and
it's
not
"me,"
it's
us.
it's
all
of
us.
it's
63
"million,"
but
it's
much
more
than
63
million.
much
more.
and
right
"now,"
our
numbers
are
higher
than
they've
ever
been
before.
they've
never
been
this
high.
but
they
want
to
stop
us
because
they
know
we
are
"here,"
and
that's
what
we're
"doing,"
and
that's
what's
taking
up
so
much
time.
we're
draining
the
swamp
in
washington.
nothing
terrifies
democrats
more
than
the
fact
that
all
of
their
spying…
spying.
they
actually
spied
on
my
campaign.
can
you
believe
it?
i
"mean,"
you
"know,"
they
try
and
"say,"
"\"well,"
we
were
actually
just
checking
things
out.
"oh,"
that's
"wonderful.\""
the
"lying,"
the
falsifying
over
the
past
three
years
"plus,"
before
i
ever
even
announced
they
were
spying.
i
guess
they
knew
we
were
going
to
"win,"
right?
but
over
that
past
more
than
three
years
is
finally
being
exposed.
and
remember
"this,"
that
truth
is
a
force
of
nature.
desperate
to
conceal
their
"misdeeds,"
the
democrats
are
now
attacking
us
for
calling
out
the
grave
corruption
of
the
"bidens,"
just
like
they
melted
down
when
we
pointed
out
crooked
hillary's
shocking
and
very
many
misdeeds.
"33,000"
emails.
"33,000"
emails
"disappeared,"
but
she
said
they
only
had
to
do
with

working
out
at
her
daughter's
wedding.

how
about
last
week?
did
you
hear?
i
don't
know
who
tulsi
gabbard
"is,"
but
i
know
one
thing.
she's
not
an
agent
of
russia.
and
jill
"stein,"
she's
a
greenie.
that's
fine.
we
love
the
"environment,"
everybody
in
this
room.
you
"know,"
right
now
we
have
the
cleanest
air
and
the
cleanest
water
that
we've
ever
"had,"
and
yet
we're
number
one
in
the
world
in
"energy,"
by
far.
we
took
over.
but
i
don't
know
jill
stein.
she
ran
last
time.
i
don't
"know,"
but
i
know
she's
not
an
agent
of
russia.
and
when
hillary
made
those
"statements,"
two
"statements,"
both
of
"them,"
"\"they"
work
for
"russia,"
they're
agents
"of…\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
when
she
made
that
statement
about
me
three
years
"ago,"
it
took
me
two
years
to
get
out
of
that
hoax
"statement.\""
she
made
it
about
them.
everybody
laughed
because
of
what
we
proved.
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
these
are
very
bad
people.
these
are
very
dishonest
"people,"
and
the
media
is
worse
than
all
of
them.
but
think
about
the
preposterous
hoax
the
democrats
are
now
trying
to
peddle.
i've
just
"beaten,"
with
no…
"look,"
"look,"
we
didn't
have
too
much
political
experience.
i
did
a
good
"job,"
built
lots
of
buildings
all
over
the
"place,"
had
great
success
in
show
business.
just
did
one
show.
it
was
called
the
"apprentice,"
and
it
was
a
big
success.
14
seasons.
and
when
i
"left,"
crazy
arnold
took
over.
it
didn't
do
too
well.
it
was
dead.
it
was
dead
from
the
first
episode.
i
saw
"him,"
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
it's
terrible.
what
have
they
done
to
this
beautiful
"show?\""
arnold?
but
think
of
it.
i've
just
"beaten,"
with
no
political
"experience,"
the
clinton
"dynasty,"
the
bush
"dynasty,"
the
president
barack
hussein
obama
dynasty.
and
president
obama
worked
harder
at
defeating
me
than
crooked
hillary
clinton
"did,"
right?
he
was
all
over
the
place.
it's
the
only
time
i've
actually
seen
him
work
"hard,"
when
it
came
to
trying
to
beat
trump.
true.
true.
remember
he
said…
remember
he
"said,"
"\"he"
will
not
be
"president\"?"
"well,"
that
didn't
work
out
so
well.
and
then
they
figured
they
could
take
us
out
a
different
"way,"
very
"dishonesty,"
"right,"
with
the
lying
and
the
spying
and
the
leaking.
and
we
are
kicking
their
ass.
i'll
tell
you.
in
the
delusional
democrat
"fantasy,"
i'm
now
supposed
to
be
afraid
of
someone
called
1%
joe.
i
used
to
call
him
1%
because
you
could
never
get
1%
in
the
primaries.
then
he
got
brought
out
by
obama
out
of
the
trash
"heap,"
became
vice
president.
but
we've
now
named
him
very
"slow,"
sleepy
joe.
very
slow.
he's
gotten
slower
and
slower.
i'm
afraid
if
he
gets
a
"nomination,"
he'll
be
so
slow
we'll
have
the
lowest-rated
debates
in
history
as
opposed
to
the
highest-rated
debates
in
history
against
crooked
hillary.
in
"fact,"
i
don't
even
think
that
sleepy
joe
will
get
it.
but
many
people
are
running.
"so,"
you
"know,"
it's
so
early.
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
their
campaign.
"oh,"
did
you
hear
beto?
beto?
did
you
hear
beto?
beto.
"oh,"
that
poor
bastard.
"well,"
"poor,"
pathetic
guy.
he
was
pathetic.
remember
the
arms
a-flailing?
remember
that?
you
"know,"
he
ran
against
ted
cruz.
ted
cruz
won.
he
spent
almost
100
million
"dollars,"
and
ted
cruz…
and
i
helped
"ted,"
and
we
campaigned
"together,"
and
it
was
good.
but
i
used
to
watch
him.
then
when
he
came
onto
the
really
big
"stage,"
this
crazy
"stage,"
i
noticed
he
was
flailing
with
the
"arms,"
and
he
was
standing
on
tables.
he
was
standing
on
countertops.
i
"said,"
"\"does"
he
ever
stand
on
the
floor
and
"speak?\""
but
he's
waving
his
arms
and
going
"crazy,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
he
doing?
what
is
he
"on?\""
and
do
you
remember
he
made
the
statement
that
he
was
born
for
this?
anybody
that
says
he
was
born
for
"this,"
they're
in
trouble.
i
used
to
have
guys
come
into
my
"office,"
"\"sir,"
i'm
the
greatest
salesman.
nobody
can
"sell…\""
you
"know,"
the
truth
is
anybody
that
says
they're
a
great
"salesman,"
usually
they're
not
a
very
good
salesman.
it's
true.
it's
those
sneaky
ones
in
the
back
that
don't
"talk,"
that
you
don't
know
about.
they're
the
ones.
but
beto
was
"nasty,"
and
he
said
that
he
was
born
for
"it,"
like
he
was
born
from
heaven.
he
came
down.
and
if
that's
the
"case,"
some
really
bad
things
"happen,"
because
he
made
a
total
fool
out
of
himself.
and
he
came
out
of
"texas,"
the
great
state
of
texas.
he
came
out
of
"texas,"
a
very
hot
political
"property,"
and
he
went
back
as
cold
as
you
can
be.
so
he
was
a
nasty
"guy,"
but
he
had
a
couple
of
policies
that
don't
work
well
in
the
state
of
texas.
right?
he
was
against
religion.
he
was
against
you
having
a
gun.
and
he
was
against
oil.
so
you
come
from
"texas,"
you
don't
like
"religion,"
you
don't
like
"oil,"
and
you
don't
have
guns.
i
don't
know.
that's
not
a
good
combination
in
the
state
of
texas.
that's
not
good
in
"mississippi,"
either.
i
don't
know
it's
that
good
anywhere.
"nah,"
he
went
back
home
to
"texas,"
and
hopefully
we
won't
be
hearing
about
him
for
a
long
time.
it's
amazing
how
cold
you
could
get
so
"quickly,"
but
he
was
a
nasty
guy.
but
in
the
twist…
"oh,"
alabama.
love
alabama.
i
love
alabama.
i
love
alabama.
it's
a
great
place.
but
in
the
very
twisted
and
corrupt
world
of
adam
"schiff,"
after
beating
the
entire
political
"establishment,"
and
that
means
bush
and
that
means
clinton
and
that
means
"obama,"
they
have
me
supposedly
saying
to
"myself,"
"\"well,"
let's
see.
i
got
a
guy
named
sleepy
joe
biden.
how
do
i
beat
him?
how
do
i
beat
him?
how
do
i
beat
this
guy?
he's
such
a
"great.\""
"clinton,"
she
was
easy.
right?
obama
was
easy.
the
bush
dynasty
was.
but
sleepy
"joe,"
i'm
worried
"about,"
right?
so
then
i
said
to
"myself,"
"\"gee,"
i
guess
there's
only
one
way.
let's
call
up
ukraine
for
help.
these
people
are
sick.
these
people
are
sick.
"now,"
these
dishonest
people
will
take
the
last
little
sliver
and
the
first
little
sliver
and
they'll
put
"it,"
because
they're
so
damn
"dishonest,"
and
they'll
just
say-
…
"\"let's"
use
ukraine
for
"help.\""
that's
what
they're
going
to
say.
and
they
won't
show
the
"laughter,"
and
they
won't
show
the
"sarcasm,"
and
they
won't
show
the
fun
because
they're
the
most
dishonorable
people
almost
on
earth.
it's
a
disgrace.
but
we
say
it
anyway.
and
here's
the
good
news.
the
people
get
it.
so
they
have
a
brand
new
president
in
ukraine.
good
"guy,"
by
the
way.
and
i
call
a
brand
new
"person,"
a
man
i
have
no
idea
who
he
"is,"
and
i'm
on
a
"phone,"
right?
and
i
know
many
people
are
on
the
phone
because
when
you
call
the
leaders
of
"country,"
many
people
listen.
and
i'm
on
the
"phone,"
and
they
want
me
to
say
to
this
brand
new
"president,"
just
got
"there,"
called
to
congratulate
"him,"
"\"please,"
could
you
help
me
"please?\""
i
don't
know
who
he
is.
i
didn't
know
his
name
until
i
looked
down
the
"card,"
i
see.
and
he's
a
nice
"guy,"
and
hopefully
he's
going
to
root
out
corruption
because
ukraine
has
tremendous
corruption
problems.
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
held
up
"money,"
very
"important,"
corruption.
but
the
other
reason…
why
isn't
germany
and
france
and
uk
and
all
of
these
european
nations
that
are
right
there…
why
aren't
they
doing
things
that
they're
supposed
to
do?
why
is
it
always
the
united
states?
so
i
made
this
"call,"
had
this
wonderful
"call,"
and
the
transcript
proves
it
"was,"
as
i
"said,"
perfect.
it
was
perfect.
it
wasn't
like
almost…
it
was
perfect.
it
was
totally
appropriate.
i
made
it
at
the
behest
of
people
to
"say,"
"\"could"
you
call
and
say
"hello?\""
now
i'm
an
honest
"person,"
anyway.
but
do
you
"think,"
when
i'm
making
a
call
to
a
newly-elected
president
of
a
"country,"
that
i
would
say
something
improper
when
i
know
there
are
so
many
people
listening
on
the
line?
many
people.
whoever
the
hell
wants
to
"listen,"
they
"listen,"
and
they
have
me
making
some
kind
of
a
deal
with
all
these
people.
and
"remember,"
the
new
president
of
ukraine
is
speaking
to
the
united
states
of
"america,"
the
president.
i
guarantee
he's
got
a
lot
of
people
"listening,"
too.
these
people
are
sick.
""
no
pressure.
they
must
think
we're
"nuts,"
to
be
honest.
it's
all
a
phony
"deal,"
this
whole
impeachment
"scam,"
to
try
to
undermine
the
2020
election
and
to
de-legitimatize
one
of
the
greatest
"elections,"
maybe
the
greatest
…
i
"mean,"
let's
give
george
washington
"credit,"
but
everybody
expected
he
was
going
to
"win,"
that
we've
ever
had.
so
my
phone
"call,"
which
was
totally
perfect
and
"appropriate,"
and
if
you
want
to
read
the
"transcript,"
you
see
how
perfect
it
"was,"
but
they
don't
quit.
but
what
you
should
do
is
take
a
look
at
the
behavior
of
sleepy
joe.
so
i
"quote,"
"\"i"
"said\""
…
let
me
act
like
him.
i've
got
to
speak
really
slow
"though,"
and
…
"\"i"
"said,"
‘you're
not
getting
a
billion.'
i
looked
at
them
and
i
"said,"
‘i'm
leaving
in
six
hours.
if
the
prosecutor
isn't
"fired,"
you're
not
getting
the
money.
you
understand?
you're
not
getting
the
"money.'\""
then
he
"goes,"
at
the
end
…
i
didn't
know
he
had
this
kind
of
energy.
he
"goes,"
"\"well,"
son
of
a
"bitch,"
he
got
"fired.\""
you
"know,"
in
a
certain
"way,"
i
was
impressed
"because,"
i
"mean,"
i
didn't
think
he
had
the
"energy,"
the
brain
power.
it's
turned
out
he
doesn't.
by
the
"way,"
he's
dropping
like
a
rock.
when
you're
at
"1%,"
there's
always
a
reason.
he
should
be
there
fairly
soon.
as
you
"know,"
the
ukrainian
prosecutor
that
biden
got
fired
after
threatening
to
"withhold,"
i
think
it
was
$1
billion
or
something
in
"aid,"
was
the
prosecutor
investigating
his
son's
"company,"
that
was
paying
hunter
"biden,"
a
guy
just
got
thrown
out
of
the
navy
…
he
was
paying
them
millions
of
"dollars,"
even
"though,"
working
for
an
energy
"company,"
he
had
no
experience
with
energy.
he
knew
less
about
it
than
this
young
…
how
old
are
you?
six.
this
"young,"
beautiful
person
in
front
of
me.
six.
and
this
young
six-year-old
is
"smarter,"
so
i
think
i'd
basically
go
with
her.
so
what
is
it
all
about?
it's
called
a
"payoff,"
but
you
know
what?
the
fake
"news,"
they
apologize.
i
watched
this
horrible
guy
who
gets
lousy
"ratings,"
anderson
cooper.
"well,"
the
"hatred,"
i
"mean,"
between
him
and
fredo.
you've
got
fredo
and
…
that's
"cuomo,"
fredo.
i
call
him
"fredo,"
like
from
the
movie.
now
i
watched
anderson
cooper
and
i
watched
him
apologize
for
even
asking
the
question
to
biden.
the
good
news
is
biden
didn't
know
too
much
about
what
the
hell
he
was
talking
about.
remember
biden
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know
these
people.
i
don't
know
them.
i
don't
know
"them.\""
""
we're
dealing
with
"life,"
right?
he
never
spoke
to
him.
"unfortunately,"
the
next
day
…
in
the
world
of
the
"internet,"
in
the
world
of
smart
people
…
that's
why
i
like
"beto,"
he
wasn't
"smart,"
couldn't
handle
it.
i
told
my
"wife,"
i
"said,"
"\"see,"
it's
not
so
"easy.\""
i
told
our
great
first
lady
"tonight,"
who
people
love.
they
love
her.
when
beto
"quit,"
he
quit
like
a
dog.
when
he
quit
i
"said,"
"\"see,"
people
think
this
is
easy.
this
isn't
"easy,\""
but
it
just
worked
out
that
way.
but
biden
"said,"
"\"i"
never
met
the
"people,"
never
met
the
"gentlemen.\""
"unfortunately,"
in
about
10
"seconds,"
a
picture
came
out
where
they're
playing
golf
"together,"
but
he
never
met
him.
so
now
you'll
ask
"him,"
he'll
"say,"
"\"no,"
we
played
around
a
golf.
we
were
together
for
three
hours.
i
never
mentioned
the
fact
that
they're
paying
my
son
"millions.\""
"oh,"
"no,"
"no,"
no.
…
"well,"
they
might
be
watching
us.
i
guess
they
do
watch
us.
he
used
to
interview
me.
he
was
so
nice.
prior
to
running
for
"politics,"
he
was
so
nice
to
me.
it
was
like
they
were
love
"fests,"
but
i
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
him.
they
were
love
fests.
what
a
thought.
he's
weak.
he's
a
weak
"person,"
but
they're
all
weak.
but
let
me
just
tell
you
something.
we
need
honesty
with
our
media.
we
need
"honesty,"
because
the
new
york
"times,"
the
washington
post
…
and
by
the
"way,"
i
don't
"know,"
you
probably
read
it.
we
threw
them
out
at
the
white
house.
we
don't
show
them
anymore.
if
somebody
wants
to
go
and
buy
them;
we
threw
them
out.
and
they
came
into
my
office
and
then
i
got
to
get
back
to
this
guy.
where's
hunter?
where's
hunter?
we
had
a
tee
shirt
"made,"
"\"where's"
hunter?
where's
"hunter?\""
poor
hunter.
he
then
came
"out,"
he
did
the
morning
show.
that
was
the
last
we've
seen
of
hunter.
that
wasn't
good.
the
morning
of
his
father's
very
bad
"debate,"
but
"it's,"
where
is
hunter?
but
before
i
say
the
final
thing
on
hunter
and
then
we
put
him
to
rest
for
a
"while,"
we
got
rid
of
the
washington
post
and
the
failing
new
york
times.
we
got
rid
of
"them,"
right?
we
don't
have
them
in
the
white
house.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
you
could
…
people
can
go
out
and
buy
"them,"
but
we
"don't\""
…
we
used
to
have
them
stacked
"up,"
and
i'd
go
in
and
i'd
see
a
meeting
with
my
people
and
they're
dealing
with
"china,"
south
"korea,"
or
somebody.
and
i'd
go
into
these
offices;
i'd
see
10
or
15
of
them
packed
up
all
over
the
"place,"
the
washington
"post,"
and
the
new
york
times.
i
keep
trying
to
figure
out
who's
worse.
and
one
day
it's
the
"times,"
one
day
it's
the
post.
it's
like
top
each
"other,"
they're
so
bad.
it's
so
phony.
in
my
"opinion,"
it's
virtually
corrupt.
i've
never
seen
it.
you
never
have
a
good
story.
i
"mean,"
even
when
we
got
"al-baghdadi,"
the
washington
post
had
a
story
that
he
was
like
a
great
religious
cleric.
where
did
that
come
from?
the
other
"thing,"
if
obama
would
have
done
it
…
"because,"
look.
this
guy
built
isis.
the
"caliphate,"
it
was
the
size
physically
of
"ohio,"
the
state
of
"ohio,"
the
great
state
of
ohio.
that's
a
"big,"
lot
of
land.
7
million
"people,"
and
they
were
the
"ones,"
the
orange
jumpsuits.
i
called
a
lot
of
the
parents
after
we
did
this
and
i
talked
to
them
and
they
were
…
how
can
you
be
happy?
but
they
were
so
thrilled
that
we
got
this
animal.
they
were
so
thrilled.
but
you
know
what?
and
you
know
what?
we
don't
do
it
for
…
we
do
it
because
it's
right.
that
story
was
a
massive
story.
that
was
the
"biggest,"
maybe
the
"biggest,"
one
of
the
"biggest,"
ever.
bigger
than
anything.
that
story
disappeared
so
fast.
done.
and
that's
okay.
i
didn't
do
it
for
the
story.
i
did
it
because
it's
the
right
thing
to
do.
but
if
i
were
a
"democrat,"
they'd
be
talking
about
that
story
for
weeks.
with
"me,"
they
don't
even
want
to
…
they
actually
played
it
down.
and
"actually,"
and
i'm
happy
about
"this,"
conan
the
dog
got
more
publicity
than
me.
and
i'm
very
happy
with
that.
i'm
very
…
conan
is
incredible.
and
conan's
coming
to
the
white
house
in
a
few
weeks.
but
it
is
true.
did
you
ever
see
a
story
disappear
so
fast?
i
"mean,"
if
obama
had
that
"story,"
that
thing
would
be
going
on
for
another
seven
months.
they'd
be
talking
about
his
bravery.
"oh,"
so
bravery.
but
"again,"
142
judges
he
gave
us.
remember
that.
how
can
you
be
a
great
…
they
always
say
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
do
is
federal
judges.
we
got
two
supreme
courts.
great
ones.
great
judge.
gorsuch
and
"kavanaugh,"
great
judges.
by
the
"way,"
did
you
ever
see
any
human
being
treated
worse
than
now-justice
kavanaugh?
did
anybody
ever?
was
any
human
being
by
these
"people,"
these
"horrible,"
horrible
people
that
we
have
to
deal
with?
"anyway,"
just
to
finish.
so
hunter
then
goes
to
china.
now
i'm
dealing
with
china
right
now.
they
don't
like
me
too
much.
they
dream
about
the
day
when
somebody
else
…
and
would
they
like
to
have
…
how
about
this?
you
give
this
"son,"
who
has
zero
experience
with
"investing,"
"too,"
you
give
him
$1.5
billion
to
"invest,"
meaning
he
makes
millions
and
millions
of
"dollars,"
and
the
biggest
guys
on
wall
street
can't
get
it.
he
walks
out
with
$1.5
billion.
and
then
there
are
other
places
"also,"
i
understand.
"folks,"
it's
disgraceful
that
the
press
doesn't
cover
it
for
what
it
is.
it's
a
payoff.
it's
a
payoff.
and
how
would
you
like
to
have
sleepy
"joe,"
with
the
son
getting
all
of
this
money
from
"china,"
become
president
and
take
over
the
china
deal?
they
are
not
liking
me.
they
had
the
worst
year
that
they've
had
in
57
years.
their
supply
chain
is
broken
up
like
scrambled
eggs
and
they
want
to
make
a
deal
because
those
tariffs
have
given
us
millions
of
dollars
and
billions
"now,"
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
we're
taking
billions
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
you
know
what
we're
doing
with
some
of
it?
just
a
small
"portion,"
but
"100%,"
they're
taking
care
of
…
our
farmers
got
$16
billion
last
year
and
$12
billion
the
year
before
because
they
targeted
our
"farmers,"
because
they
know
the
farmers
love
trump
and
trump
loves
the
farmers.
so
they
targeted
them
and
they
brought
the
$16
billion
down
to
practically
nothing.
and
they
thought
our
farmers
would
"say,"
"\"oh,"
we
don't
like
"trump.\""
they
did
just
the
opposite.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
know
he's
doing
the
right
thing
because
we've
been
ripped
off
for
so
many
"years.\""
but
i
said
to
"him,"
i
said
to
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
sonny
"purdue,"
a
great
guy;
i
"said,"
"\"sonny,"
how
much
did
they
spend
buying
our
corn
and
soy
beans
and
all
of
our
agricultural
"product?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
$16
"billion.\""
i
"said,"
"\"good,"
i'll
make
it
"up.\""
and
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
leftover.
so
we
will
"have,"
pretty
"soon,"
over
$100
billion
in
money
paid
into
the
united
states
treasury
by
a
country
that
never
gave
us
25
cents.
they
only
took.
they
only
took.
so
when
i
said
to
the
"farmers,"
"\"we're"
going
to
send
you
$16
"billion,"
and
it's
already
been
sent.
and
it's
been
split
into
$12
billion
the
year
"before.\""
i
"mean,"
think
of
"that,"
$28
billion.
i
"said,"
"\"compliments"
of
"china.\""
and
we
had
a
lot
left
over.
not
"bad,"
right?
not
bad.
you
think
obama
would
do
that?
i
don't
think
so.
you
think
hillary
would
do
that?
i
don't
think
so.
you
think
sleepy
joe
would
do
that?
i
don't
think
so.
he
wouldn't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
on
"tuesday,"
the
proud
people
of
mississippi
will
send
democrats
a
clear
message.
it's
very
important
for
this
"reason,"
as
well
as
the
fact
that
you
have
a
great
gentleman
in
your
midst.
but
you
have
to
reject
their
extremism
and
their
socialism
and
their
corruption.
they're
corrupt.
adam
schiff
is
a
corrupt
politician.
you
know
when
he
made
that
phony
speech
where
he
made
up
a
really
horrible
speech
and
said
that
i
said
"it,"
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
i'm
going
to
sue
"him.\""
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
i'm
sorry.
you
"can't.\""
he's
got
total
immunity
because
he
made
it
in
congress.
can
you
believe
this?
but
here's
the
good
news.
at
least
we
have
a
"forum,"
we
have
a
place
we
can
talk
so
everyone
knows
what's
going
on.
a
bunch
of
phony
"people,"
but
this
is
why
we
have
to
send
a
signal
and
why
you
have
to
make
tate
reeves
your
"great,"
new
republican
…
right?
republican
"governor,"
right?
"hey,"
he's
a
great
"guy,"
too.
and
all
i
know
is
he's
loved
and
respected
by
your
current
"governor,"
because
phil
is
some
piece
of
work.
phil
is
so
confident.
i
wanted
phil
to
run
for
a
certain
"office,"
then
i
wanted
him
to
do
something.
i've
tried
to
get
"him,"
but
some
guys
are
confident.
phil
"said,"
"\"no"
"sir,"
i've
been
doing
this
all
my
life.
i
love
the
"people.\""
he
built
the
most
beautiful
african-american
museum.
"phil,"
he's
the
"greatest,"
but
he
built
the
most
beautiful
…
but
he's
got
confidence.
and
he
"said,"
"\"no"
"sir,"
i'd
been
doing
it.
i
don't
really
want
to
do
"that.\""
in
other
"words,"
he
"said,"
"\"that's"
"enough.\""
…
"oh,"
we
love
our
"police,"
right?
i
love
our
police.
we
love
our
police.
he'll
oppose
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
is
just
terrible.
they're
terrible.
and
tate
will
always
defend
your
second
amendment.
so
tate's
running
against
a
liberal
democrat
named
jim
hood.
now
all
i
know
about
jim
hood
is
he
fought
very
hard
to
elect
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
barack
hussein
obama.
isn't
that
nice?
he
wanted
obama
to
win
so
badly
and
then
he
wanted
hillary
to
win.
and
that's
not
the
kind
of
guy
we
need
here.
not
in
mississippi.
he's
supported
by
extreme
leftists
like
stacey
"abrams,"
"who,"
by
the
way
went
down
to
defeat
in
front
of
a
terrific
gentlemen
from
the
great
state
of
"georgia,"
brian
kemp.
and
they
came
in
with
…
"oh,"
they
brought
them
all.
they
had
president
"obama,"
they
had
michelle
"obama,"
they
had
oprah
winfrey.
they
came
"in,"
and
all
he
had
was
donald
"trump,"
and
we
won.
we
"won,"
fairly
easily.
but
stacey
abrams
wants
to
give
illegal
aliens
the
right
to
vote.
do
you
believe
this?
i
"mean,"
some
of
these
"people,"
they
want
to
give
them
education.
they
want
to
give
them
this.
they
want
to
give
them
free
healthcare.
they
want
to
give
these
"people,"
that
come
into
our
country
illegally
all
"benefits,"
and
he
opposed
our
travel
"ban,"
which
is
so
important
that
we
won
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
keep
terrorists
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
and
jim
hood
went
to
the
united
nations
and
opposed
your
right
to
self-defense.
if
you
don't
want
a
far
left
democrat
running
mississippi
…
wait
a
minute.
how's
this
guy?
i
can't
believe
this
is
a
competitive
race.
it's
embarrassing.
i'm
talking
to
mississippi.
i'm
talking
to
mississippi.
i
can't
believe
it.
i
don't
think
that
he's
going
to
be
the
right
guy.
i
think
the
guy
that
you
want
is
tate
reeves.
he's
going
to
be
fantastic.
he
will
be
a
"great,"
great
governor.
"tate,"
come
on
up.
tate.
thank
"you,"
tate.
"tuesday,"
go
out
and
vote
for
tate.
he'll
never
let
you
down.
and
don't
kid
yourself.
your
second
amendment
is
under
"attack,"
but
not
with
him.
it's
under
attack.
so
we're
also
joined
tonight
by
a
man
who
is
"truly,"
and
i've
sort
of
said
it
a
"lot,"
but
he's
been
a
great
governor
and
he
loves
your
state.
he
loves
the
people
of
this
great
"state,"
governor
phil
bryant.
where's
phil?
come
"up,"
phil.
come
up.
"oh,"
he's
central
casting.
look
at
him.
come
"here,"
phil.
thank
"you,"
phil.
thank
you.
thank
"you,"
my
phil.
what
a
job.
what
a
great
job.
you
have
to
continue
that
whole
thing
going
forward.
so
another
man
who's
a
warrior
is
a
friend
of
mine.
whenever
there's
a
"problem,"
he's
there.
he's
always
there.
he'll
be
right
at
the
front.
he
is
tough.
he
is
smart.
he's
"brilliant,"
actually.
and
he
loves
this
state
and
he
loves
you
people.

under

lost
"60,000"

under

added

"100,000"

were

like
"that,"

that's
"awful,"
and
a
big
price
to
pay
for
washington's
disloyalty
to

that's
what
it
was.
it
was
"disloyalty,"

lots
of
reasons.

now
you
finally
have
a

is
loyal

i
am.
i'm

for

for

your

it's
a

about
time
we
got
rid
of

the
do-nothing
democrats
need
to
stop
their
madness
and
pass
the

right
now.
the

horrendous

would
have
destroyed

"proudly,"

before
my
"election,"
our
leaders
used
the
great
american
middle
class
as
a
piggy
bank
to
fund
their
delusional
global
projects
all
over
the
world.
we
take
care
of
other
people.
we
take
care
of
other
"countries,"
but
we
don't
take
care
of
our
own.
they
knowingly
decimated
american
manufacturing
to
promote
economic
growth
in
foreign
countries.
they
deployed
our
military
to
protect
…
think
of
this
…
immensely
wealthy
"nations,"
subsidizing
their
welfare
states
with
your
money.
i
ask
those
wealthy
nations
"now,"
i
respectfully
the
other
day
said
to
the
king
of
saudi
"arabia,"
"\"king,"
we're
going
to
help
"you,"
but
you've
got
to
"pay.\""
and
he
was
great.
"no,"
he
was
great.
he
was
great.
he
"said,"
"\"but"
nobody
has
ever
asked
"before.\""
i
"said,"
"\"but"
i'm
"asking.\""
and
billions
of
dollars
will
come
"in,"
and
we're
protecting
a
great
ally.
we
have
a
country
that
spends
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
in
our
country
buying
military
and
other
things.
but
we
"said,"
"\"you're"
very
wealthy.
you
have
to
"pay,\""
and
they're
going
to
pay.
and
that's
true
with
many
countries
by
the
way.
that's
true
with
many
countries.
they
never
respected
us.
they
could
never
believe
it.
i
said
to
one
country
…
i
have
great
respect
for
the
prime
minister
of
japan.
i
said
to
prime
"minister,"
i
"said,"
"\"how"
did
you
get
away
with
this
for
so
"long?\""
and
he
looked
at
me
and
he
couldn't
really
answer
it
because
how
the
hell
did
this
happen?
we're
protecting
94

ask
"china,"
"\"how"
many

"\"russia.\""
you
ask
other
countries
…
we're
protecting
at
least
94.
in
"fact,"
so
many
they
can't
even
tell
me.
i've
been
trying
to
get
an
answer
for
four
months.
so
many
they
can't
even
tell.
it's
"crazy,"
but
it's
all
beautiful
the
way
it's
happening.
a
lot
of
good
things
are
happening.
but
these
same
politicians
poured
precious
american
blood
and
treasure
into
the
sands
of
the
middle
east
while
allowing
our
cities
to
fall
into
disrepair
and
decay.
our
failed
ruling
class
believed
it
was
their
right
to
rule
over
"you,"
to
take
your
"money,"
to
take
your
"jobs,"
to
redistribute
your
wealth
all
over
the
"globe,"
wherever
they
wanted
it.
but
i
don't
like
that.
i
don't
like
that.
the
great
sellout
has
"ended,"
and
it
ended
the
day
i
took
the
oath
of
office.
that
was
quite
a
day.
after
years
of
building
up
foreign
"nations,"
we
are
finally
building
up
our
nation.
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
our
policy
of
never-ending
"war,"
regime
change
and
nation-building
is
being
replaced
by
the
clear-eyed
pursuit
of
american
interests.
it
is
the
job
of
our
military
to
protect
our
"security,"
not
to
be
the
policemen
of
the
world.
proving
the
wisdom
of
this
"approach,"
we
recently
secured
a
permanent
ceasefire
in
northern
syria
without
spilling
one
drop
of
american
blood.
not
one
drop.
"actually,"
i
have
to
be
honest.
one
soldier
stepped
on
a
nail.
that's
true.
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
tell
the
press
that
because
they'll
"say,"
but
one
soldier
stepped
in
a
"nail.\""
i
"said,"
"\"how"
bad
was
"it?\""
"\"it's"
"okay.\""
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
mention
it
"please.\""
they
always
like
to
mention
exactly
what
happened.
you
can
take
it
a
little
bit
low
key.
stepped
on
a
nail.
not
a
drop
of
blood.
and
we
don't
have
to
defend
the
borders
between
turkey
and
syria.
they've
been
fighting
for
1000
years.
but
what
we
do
is
we
did
keep
the
"oil,"
if
you
don't
mind.
we
kept
the
oil.
we
kept
the
oil.
and
we'll
distribute
that
"oil,"
we'll
help
out
the
"kurds,"
and
we'll
help
out
other
people.
we'll
also
help
out
ourselves
if
that's
okay.
past
"leaders,"
foolish
military
adventures
turned
far
away
nations
into
"very,"
very
dangerous
war
zones.
then
they
demanded
that
american
citizens
accept
unlimited
migration
from
those
terror-afflicted
nations
and
regions.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
we
did
not
fight
them
over
there
only
to
invite
them
over
here.
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
to
protect
our
"communities,"
my
administration
restricted
migration
from
terror-prone
nations
and
implemented
the
toughest
ever
vetting
procedures.
toughest
ever
that
we've
ever
had.
no
issue
has
ever
been
so
horribly
discarded
by
a
party
as
that
issue
by
the
democrats.
they
want
open
"borders,"
which
mean
crime.
they
want
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
means
crime
and
drugs
and
death.
after
bleeding
the
middle
class
"dry,"
democrats
threw
open
our
borders
to
the
"world,"
flooding
our
communities
with
poisonous
drugs
and
criminal
cartels.
republicans
believe
in
strong
borders
and
safe
communities.
we
are
now
building
a
wall.
we're
building
it.
we're
building
it.
and
you
think
that
was
easy?
the
"democrats,"
they
didn't
want
that
wall.
i
got
money
for
"everything,"
but
when
it
came
to
the
"wall,"
not
25
cents.
not
25
cents.
but
we
gave
the
military
a
lot
of
money
and
we
took
it
from
the
military
and
we
took
it
from
"here,"
we
took
it
from
there.
or
we
had
to
go
to
court
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
start
winning
cases.
we're
winning
cases
now.
winning
a
lot
of
cases.
but
the
wall
is
going
up
rapidly.
it's
going
up
rapidly.
and
this
is
a
very
serious
wall.
this
is
the
exact
everything
they
wanted.
i
went
to
the
border
"patrol,"
incredible
people
and
ice.
incredible
"people,"
tough
people.
they
love
our
country.
and
i
"said,"
"\"give"
me
the
specifications
for
the
"wall.\""
they
"said,"
"\"well"
"sir,"
we'd
like
"steel,"
but
would
also
like
concrete
and
would
also
like
"rebar.\""
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
what
do
you
want?
which
"one?\""
so
i
did
all
three
because
it's
a
different
form
of
cutting.
you
can
cut
through
"steel,"
but
you
can't
through
the
concrete
and
then
you
can't
through
the
hardened
rebar.
we
got
it
all.
"\"and"
we
also
need
"see-through,"
sir.
got
to
see
who's
on
the
other
"side.\""
that
makes
"sense,"
right?
not
just
concrete.
it's
more
expensive
what
we're
"doing,"
but
we're
giving
and
we're
building
…
we
should
have
anywhere
from
400
to
almost
500
miles
of
wall
built
by
the
end
of
next
year.
it's
going
up
fast.
in
all
the
right
areas.
in
all
the
right
areas.
that
was
a
tough
one.
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
is
building
their
hearts
out.
they're
great.
great
people.
we
believe
in
keeping
terrorists
and
criminals
and
drug
dealers
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
and
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
on
the
southern
"border,"
tough
"place,"
illegal
crossings
have
dropped
60%
since
"may,"
and
we
are
faster
than
ever
securing
the
southern
border.
and
soon
it
will
"be,"
when
the
wall
is
"completed,"
secure
like
it's
never
been
before.
and
i
want
to
thank
the
country
of
mexico.
they
right
now
have
"27,000"
soldiers
on
our
borders.
"27,000."
you
know
what
that
is?
and
they
are
keeping
people
out.
and
i
want
to
thank
the
president
of
mexico.
he's
an
excellent
"person,"
great
man.
and
we
appreciate
it.
and
the
reason
is
that
our
democrats
won't
even
approve
things
called
loopholes.
they're
loopholes.
that's
a
horrible
"name,"
right?
that
means
it's
a
loophole.
that
means
you
can
come
in
illegally
and
lots
of
things.
catch
and
release.
you
catch
them.
then
you've
got
to
release
them.
by
law
you've
got
to
release
them
or
they'll
arrest
the
border
patrol
agent
if
they
don't
release.
it's
crazy.
but
we
could
end
this
in
15
"minutes,"
but
they
don't
want
to
do
it.
they
don't
want
to
do
it.
they're
obstructionists.
they're
colluders.
and
we
can't
let
it
happen.
that's
why
you
have
to
go
with
tate
reeves.
tate's
going
to
send
a
big
"signal,"
by
the
way.
it's
a
big
signal.
it's
great
for
you.
he's
going
to
be
a
great
governor.
it
also
sends
a
big
signal
to
these
radical
"left,"
crazy
democrats.
it's
very
important
that
tate
wins.
very
important.
we're
also
fighting
deadly
sanctuary
cities
with
the
help
of
states
like
"mississippi,"
which
has
banned
sanctuary
cities
because
phil
bryant
"said,"
"\"we're"
not
going
to
have
"them,\""
and
roger
wicker
"said,"
"\"we're"
not
going
to
have
them.
and
cindy
"said,"
"\"we're"
not
going
to
have
"them.\""
democrats'
sanctuary
cities
forced
the
release
of
dangerous
criminal
aliens
onto
our
streets.
if
you
want
a
governor
who
will
stand
proudly
with
the
heroes
of
ice
…
and
they
are
"heroes,"
i
wouldn't
want
their
job.
"ms-13,"
they
walk
right
into
those
nests
…
they
call
them
a
nest
…
and
they
start
swinging.
you
never
saw
anything
like
it.
i'll
"say,"
"\"you"
know
what?
better
you
than
"me.\""
let's
see
who
would
do
good.
he'd
do
good.
that
guy.
that
guy
would
do
good.
most
of
you
wouldn't
do
too
good.
no.
i
"mean,"
these
guys
are
tough
guys
and
they
love
our
country.
who
would
do
it?
they're
moving
thousands
of
people
from
ms-13.
these
gangs
are
the
worst
people.
these
"people,"
these
are
not
human
beings.
you
"know,"
i
said
that
once
before
and
this
crazy
nancy
pelosi
"said,"
"\"how"
dare
you
say
they're
not
"human?\""
you
ever
see
these
people?
and
they
slice
people
up
with
a
knife
because
it's
more
painful
than
using
a
gun.
and
then
i
have
to
defend
myself
when
i
say
they're
animals.
but
you
know
what?
i
never
changed.
i
didn't
"say,"
"\"oh,"
i'd
like
to
apologize.
i'd
like
to
apologize.
crazy
"nancy.\""
and
you
got
to
look
at
her
district
in
san
francisco.
she's
spending
all
her
time
on
this
crap
or
this
impeachment
stuff.
take
a
look
at
what's
happening
to
the
great
"city,"
"once,"
of
san
francisco.
it's
thousands
and
thousands
of
tents
and
drugs
and
needles
and
everything
you
can
imagine
floating
in
the
streets
in
the
best
neighborhoods.
nancy

go
home
and
fix
your
"district,"
nancy.
go
home

fix

go
home
and
fix

if
you

who
will
stand
proudly
with
the
heroes
of

and
border
"patrol,"
vote
for
tate
reeves.
tuesday.
got
to
get
out.
you
got
to
get
out.
got
to
send
the
signal.
let
it
be
a
big
victory
too.
the
democrat
party
has
never
been
more
"extreme,"
you
know
"that,"
than
it
is
today.
the
democrat
healthcare
agenda
would
obliterate
medicare.
i
will
always
protect
medicare
for
our
"seniors,"
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
always.
we'll
always
take
care
of
them.
virtually
every
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
womb
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
"well,"
the
governor
of
virginia
executed
a
baby.
remember
that
whole
thing.
after
"birth,"
after
birth.
some
people
never
heard
of
it.
he
said
the
baby
is
born
and
then
he
starts
talking
to
the
mother.
nobody
ever
heard
that.
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late-term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
dream.
nobody
has
done
more
for
the
african
american
community
than
the
republican
party.
and
we're
also
the
party
of
abraham
lincoln.
we
can't
forget
that.
people
forget.
abraham
lincoln.
honest
abe.
to
lift
up
distressed
"communities,"
we
created
opportunities
zones.
so
incredible.
so
successful.
including
100
new
opportunity
zones
right
now
in
mississippi
where
money
is
now
flowing
in
to
build
and
to
fix.
and
tim
"scott,"
i
give
him
so
much
credit
from
the
great
state
of
south
carolina
choices.
they
can
go
"out,"
get
a
"doctor,"
we
pay
the
"bill,"
and
they
don't
have
to
wait
six
"weeks,"
four
"weeks,"
two
weeks.
we
had
people
waiting
in
line.
they
weren't
very
sick.
by
the
time
they
saw
the
"doctor,"
they
were
terminally
ill.
now
they
go
on
and
they
go
and
they
go
outside
and
they
find
a
doctor
and
we
take
care
of
our
great
veterans.
the
great
rebuilding
of
the
american
armed
forces
has
included
massive
investments
in
the
military
and
facilities
in
biloxi
and
gulfport
and
jackson
and
starkville.
and
roger
has
been
fantastic.
and
cindy
hyde-smith
has
been
fantastic.
thank
you.
thank
you.
thank
you.
to
protect
america's
"security,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
one-sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
it's
not
the
same
country
anymore.
nothing's
"easy,"
but
it's
not
the
same.
and
i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
for
years
you
watch
as
your
politicians
apologize
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
"america,"
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
people
of
mississippi.
the
next
step
to
victory
begins
on
tuesday
right
here
in
your
great
state.
with
your
support
we
will
show
the
corrupt
democrats
that
the
american
people
are
not
ever
going
to
back
down
from
perhaps
the
greatest
victory
in
political
history.
and
you
know
today
with
the
new
stock
market
at
an
all-time
"high,"
it's
…
i
will
tell
you
something
…
if
we
didn't
win
this
"election,"
that
stock
market
would
be
in
one-half.
it
was
heading
in
the
wrong
direction.
it
was
going
to
fail.
and
if
they
ever
did
anything
"bad,"
if
they
ever
do
anything
bad
to
"us,"
if
they
ever
succeed
in
their
wildest
"dream,"
which
will
never
let
them
"happen,"
that
stock
market
will
crash
like
you've
never
seen
a
crash
before.
and
you
will
not
be
happy
with
your
401ks
like
you're
happy
right
now
because
they
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
they
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
and
i'd
like
to
speak
"well,"
but
the
"leadership,"
they
have
no
clue.
they're
just
very
vicious
people.
"actually,"
they're
sort
of
mentally
violent
"people,"
but
we've
got
it
under
control.
it
always
helps
when
you
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
i
always
"say,"
"\"how"
do
you
impeach
a
president
who
didn't
do
anything
"wrong?\""
so
we're
going
to
send
a
signal
by
sending
a
terrific
new
republican
governor
to
jackson.
on
"tuesday,"
you're
going
to
get
out
and
you're
going
to
"vote,"
and
you're
going
to
give
up
whatever
you
have
to
give
up.
you're
going
to
leave
work
maybe
a
little
early
or
maybe
get
there
a
little
late.
tell
your
boss
i
said
it
was
okay.
i
will
give
you
a
pardon
if
i
have
to.
i'll
give
you
a
one-hour
pardon.
but
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
great
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
independence
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
and
you
have
great
congressmen
here
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
i
want
to
appreciate
"it,"
fellas.
"warriors,"
you're
warriors.
you
are
warriors.
what
was
it?
196
for
and
nothing
"against,"
right?
that
doesn't
happen
with
republicans.
it
doesn't
happen.
i
always
complain.
i
always
say
the
democrats
are
lousy
politicians.
they
have
lousy
policies.
open
"borders,"
sanctuary
"cities,"
but
they
have
one
thing.
they
stick
together
and
they're
vicious.
the
republicans
have
great
policy.
in
many
ways
they're
better
"politicians,"
but
they're
not
as
vicious.
thank
"you,"
darling.
i
appreciate
it.
they're
not
as
"vicious,"
but
they
have
a
tendency
to
split
apart.
the
democrats
don't
seem
to
have
any
mitt
romneys.
we
do.

do.
i
don't
know.
maybe
he'll
get
better.
maybe
he'll
get
better.
we'll
see.
we'll
see
what
happens.
maybe
he'll
get
better.
just
let
it
be
"fair,"
but
they
don't
have
that.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
those
"beautiful,"
beautiful
"words,"
‘made
in
the
usa.'
made
in
america.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
ending
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
can
you
believe
that?
within
10
years
it
will
be
over.
when
they
told
me
"that,"
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
"incredible.\""
we're
going
to
end
the
aids
epidemic
within
10
years.
it's
funded.
nobody
would
have
thought
we
could
do
"that,"
but
we're
doing
it.
we'll
have
it
ended
in
america
in
10
years.
the
aids
epidemic.
who
would've
thought?
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
sacred
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of

stand
with
the
incredible
heroes

enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not

and
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.

we
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
motto
and
we
always
will.
you'll
never
see
it
disappear.
in
god

trust.

stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
patriots

crossed
the
"oceans,"
settled

"continent,"
tamed

"wilderness,"
dug
out

laid
down

together

are
taking
back
our

that's
what
we're
doing.
that's
what
happened
in
2016.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
with
your
"help,"
your
devotion
and
your

we
are

it's
great
to
be
here
in

ninth
congressional
district

the
hardworking
patriots
who
believe
in
"faith,"
"family,"

tomorrow
you'll
head
to
the
polls
to
elect

always
puts
america
"first,"
dan
bishop.
i've
just
come
from
a
meeting
with
north
carolina
officials
representing
communities
hit
by
hurricane
dorian
and
i
expressed
the
unwavering
solidarity
of
the
american
"people,"
we
are
behind
you
100%.
100%.
the
prayers
of
our
entire
nation
are
with
the
citizens
of
north
"carolina,"
south
"carolina,"
"georgia,"
florida
and
everyone
else
that
was
in
the
storms
"path,"
and
i
will
say
i
was
called
by
the
government
of
the
bahamas
and
we're
helping
with
the
bahamas.
they
were
hit
so
hard.
they
were
hit
so
hard.
who
would
believe
it?
we
pledged
the
full
support
of
the
federal
government
through
every
step
of
the
rebuilding
process.
and
i
will
"say,"
north
carolina
in
our
country
probably
got
hit
the
hardest.
that
was
a
little
bit
of
a
"surprise,"
but
i
know
one
thing
about
north
carolina.
you
can
take
it
and
you'll
build
it
quickly
and
you'll
build
it
beautifully.
"and,"
you'll
be
back
sooner
then
anybody
ever
thought
and
it'll
be
better
then
ever.
right?
no
doubt
about
it.
i
also
want
to
give
a
special
recognition
to
the
many
non-governmental
organizations
doing
so
much
to
help
people
recover
from
"dorian,"
in
"particular,"
franklin

he's
a
wonderful
guy.
he's
got
an
"organization,"

based
right
here
in

and
the
work
that
franklin

he
does
such
a
great
job.
all
"over,"
whenever
there's
a
problem
you
see
samaritan's
purse
and
franklin
and
his
people.
we
love
the
people
of
this
state
and
we
will
never
ever
leave
your
side.
north
carolina
will
truly
recover
so
fast.
i
know
you
people
so
well.
let's
not
even
talk
about
it.
let's
not
even
talk
about
it.
we're
here
tonight
to
discuss
the
extraordinary
progress
we're
making
as
a
nation
and
how
to
ensure
this
amazing
resurgence
keeps
on
going
and
going
strong.
in
just
over
two
"years,"
we've
taken
this
big
beautiful
ship
and
it's
being
turned
around
very
quickly.
nobody
thought
this
would
happen.
you
know
we
won
the
greatest
"election,"
certainly
one
of
"them,"
but
maybe
the
"greatest,"
but
we
won…
let's
say
one
of
the
"greatest,"
this
way
i
won't
be
criticized.
they'll
"say,"
"\"you"
"know,"
george
washington
had
a
great
election
"too.\""
the
fake
news
right.
the
fake
news.
"but,"
we
won
one
of
the
greatest
elections
in
history
and
because
of
"that,"
and
you
would
be
in
big
trouble
if
we
"didn't,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
you'd
be…
instead
of
going
up
we
were
heading
in
the
wrong
direction.
we
have
the
number
one
economy
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
every
time
i
meet
a
foreign
"leader,"
almost
every
"time,"
they
"say,"
"\"congratulations"
on
what
you've
done
with
the
"economy.\""
i
"said,"
"\"i"
didn't
do
it.
i
just
set
a
certain
path.
the
people
of
the
united
states
did
"it.\""
number
one
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
they
tried
to
do
the
recession
thing.
you
"know,"
they
tried
the
russia
thing.
that
didn't
work.
they
tried
many
other
things.
i
always
"say,"
"\"the"
media
and
their
"partner,"
the
"democrats.\""
i
wouldn't
mind
fighting
the
"democrats,"
but
we
really
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
two-some.
it's
the
media
and
the
democrats.
it's
one
and
the
same.
we're
rebuilding
our
"military,"
defending
our
sovereignty
and
reclaiming
our
dignity
as
a
nation.
america
is
winning
again
and
america
is
respected
again.
they
respect
america.
by
the
"way,"
i
have
about
10
women
in
the
front
row
and
you
come
from
north
carolina
and
they
travel
all
over
the
place.
hold
up
your
hands.
these
are
great
women.
i
see
them
so
"much,"
and
i
must
say
they
have
other
things
to
do.
they
look
rich
as
hell
to
"me,"
i
don't
know.
how
many
is
this?
how
many
rallies
have
you
come
too?
they
can't
count.
they
said
all
of
them
except
for
two.
that's
a
lot
of
rallies
and
it
all
emanates
from
this
area.
that's
so
great.
"well,"
at
least
you
won't
have
to
travel
so
far
for
this
"one,"
right?
thank
you
very
much
for
being
here.
we
really
appreciate
it.
"well,"
we
appreciate
it.
we
appreciate
it.
thank
you.
really
incredible
people.
but
you
"know,"
we've
created
six
million
new
jobs
since
election
day
and
i
couldn't
say
that
in
my
initial
rallies
because
nobody
would
have
believed
it.
six
million
new
jobs.
more
americans
are
working
today
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
our
country.
almost
160
million
"americans,"
nobody
would
have
thought
that
was
possible.
we
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
say
it
actually.
we've
now
had
13
straight
months
of
wage
gains
of
at
least
"3%,"
so
the
people
that
work
so
hard…
you
remember
i
used
to
say
during
the
rallies
before
we
"won,"
people
worked
two
"jobs,"
three
jobs
and
they
made
less
money
then
they
made
21
years
before
and
now
wages
are
going
"up,"
the
economy
is
doing
great
and
jobs
have
never
been
better.
so
"importantly,"
more
than
70
million
americans
have
been
lifted
off
of
food
stamps.
nearly
"600,000"
americans
entered
the
labor
force
last
month
alone.
think
of
that.
and
the
unemployment
rate
for
african-americans
just
reached
another
brand
"new,"
"yesterday,"
all
time
low
in
the
history
of
our
country.
how
do
you
lose
that
debate?
remember
i
used
to
"say,"
"\"why"
do
you
have
to
"lose?\""
"well,"
now
you
have
the
best
unemployment
"numbers,"
employment
and
unemployment
"numbers,"
that
you've
ever
had
as
"african-americans,"
as
"asian-americans,"
as
hispanic-americans.
the
best
numbers
we've
ever
"had,"
and
by
the
"way,"
african-american
youth
unemployment
has
also
reached
the
lowest
level
ever
recorded
in
history.
"and,"
the
labor
force
participation
rate
for
women
is
at
the
highest
level
now
in
15
"years,"
and
soon
will
be
35
"years,"
and
"soon,"
i
"promise,"
will
probably
end
up
being
better
than
ever.
i
can
tell
you
the
unemployment
numbers
for
women
are
the
best
they've
been
now
in
72
years.
"so,"
i
always
say
"kiddingly,"
"\"i'm"

the
radical

want
to
"dismantle,"
"demolish,"

why
we
need
dan

we
need
them
going
down.
we
need
them
going
down

they
can
do
it.
it's
also
why
we
need
four
more

it's

we've
changed

changed

it's
gotta
grow.
it's
gotta
develop

once
it
"does,"
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
for
them
to
destroy
what
we've
done.
very
hard.
"and,"
that's
really
why
i
consider
this
election…
"look,"
we
had
a
"very,"
very
special
day
in
2016.
it
was
a
very
special

was

can
ever
compare
anything
to

i
can
say
"this,"
2020
is
essentially
just
as
"important,"

they'll
try

take
it
away.

for

i
don't

i
can
tell

listen
to

of

they're
trying
put
out

not

are

what
is
the

we
want
to
use?
"yeah,"

little…
nah.

they're
pushing
a

it's
not
working.

think
a

of…

"well,"
that's
"good,"

the

is

one
of

it's

you
go
to
"california,"
which
is
so
many
sanctuary

don't
know
what's
happening
out
there.
you
have
people

thom

"one,"

have
to
tell

that.
our
shared
republican
agenda
is
"pro-worker,"
"pro-jobs,"
"pro-family,"
"pro-growth,"
and
100%
pro-american.

by

"way,"
so
is
doug

and
so
john
ratcliffe.
thank
you
fellows.
thank
you.
two
incredible
fighters
also.
for
decades
our
leaders
put
global
interest
and
special
interest
ahead
of
your
interest.
you
know
that
better
than
"anybody,"
and
this
state
knows
it
better
than
anybody.
they
traded
away
your
"factories,"
sold
your
"future,"
squandered
your
tax
"dollars,"
sacrificed
your
"security,"
and
bogged
us
down
in
one
foreign
debacle
after
another.
but
all
of
that
is
changed.
we're
respected
again.
they're
all
"saying,"
"\"oh,"
gee.
i
hope
he
doesn't
do
this
or
"that.\""
they've
taken
advantage
of
us
for
"years,"
and
i
have
to
say
"sadly,"
in
many
cases
it's
our
allies
that
took
the
greatest
advantage
of
this
country.
but
now
you
finally
have
a
president
who
understands
that
i'm
not
supposed
to
be
the
president
of
the
"world,"
i'm
supposed
to
be
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america.
to
bring
back
our
jobs
for
other
"countries,"
we
passed
the
largest
package
of
tax
cuts
and
reforms
in
american
history.
we've
cut
a
record
number
of
job
killing
regulations.
no
"president,"
no
longer
how
long
they
"serve,"
has
gotten
anywhere
even
close
to
what
we've
done
with
"regulations,"
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
our
economy
is
so
good.
and
we
have
tremendous
potential
"upward,"
and
china
wants
to
talk.
they
want
to
talk.
china's
lost
three
million
"jobs,"
thousands
of
companies
are
leaving
"china,"
the
supply
chain
is
crumbling
because
they
can't
pay
the
"tariffs,"
and
our
country
has
taken
over
things
that
you
would've
never
thought.
as
an
"example,"
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
have
been
and
are
coming
into
our
country
in
the
form
of
"tariffs,"
and
china
is
eating
the
"cost,"
which
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to
tell
you.
and
out
of
the
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
that
we've
taken
"in,"
because
of
the
fact
that
our
great
american
patriot
farmers
have
been
targeted
by
"china,"
they've
been
"targeted,"
because
they
know
the
farmer
is
like
trump.
i
love
the
farmers.
so
they
targeted
the
"farmers,"
and
i
said
to
sonny
"perdue,"
secretary
of
"agriculture,"
"\"sonny,"
how
much
was
"it,"
last
year
and
the
year
before?
tell
"me.\""
it
was
$12
billion
and
it
was
$16
"billion,"
and
out
of
the
tariffs
that
we've
taken
"in,"
we
gave
to
our
farmers
for
"distribution,"
hopefully
very
good
"distribution,"
hopefully
very
even
"distribution,"
we've
given
them
$28
billion
so
that
they're
whole.
so
that
they're
whole.
nobody
would
ever
do
that.
nobody
would
ever
do
"that,"
i
can
tell
you
that
right
"now,"
and
our
farmers
know
we
have
to
fight.
i
see
it
all
the
"time,"
where
some
of
the
networks
that
are
"crazy,"
they
have
a
group
of
"farmers,"
in
some
cases
they
have
groups
of
"women,"
they
"say,"
"\"what"
do
you
think
of
president
"trump?\""
"\"we"
like
him
a
lot.
we're
with
him
all
the
"way.\""
and
they
want
to
turn
off
the
cameras.
they
go
"crazy,"
but
with
the
farmers
you
know
that.
you
ever
see
that?
the
10
women.
"\"what"
do
you
think
of
president
"trump?\""
"\"we"
love
"him!\""
boy
would
i
like
to
put
you
on
"television,"
i'll
tell
you
right
"now,"
and
they
can't
turn
off
those
cameras
fast
"enough,"
but
they
say
to
the
"farmers,"
"\"you"
voted
for
president
"trump,"
are
you
"happy?\""
and
ever
one
of
them
"said,"
"\"he"
did
things
that
no
ones
ever
done
"before.\""
who
would
think
of
getting
12
billion
plus
16
"million,"
$28
"billion,"
because
they've
been
targeted.
that's
the
amount
i
asked
"sonny,"
i
said
"sonny,"
"\"what's"
the
amount
they've
took
our
of
our
"farmers?\""
"\"it"
was
16
billion
and
the
year
before
"12.\""
and
said
"sonny,"
"\"we"
got
to
make
that
"up,\""
and
we
made
that
up.
who
would
do
that?
nobody
would
do
that.
first
of
"all,"
nobody
else
ever
had
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
pouring
in
from
china
because
it's
always
been
the
other
way
around.
china
has
taken
advantage
of
our
country
for
"decades,"
decades.
and
i
guarantee
you
one
"thing,"
none
of
these
"democrats,"
whether
it's
pocahontas
or
sleepy
"joe,"
none
of
them
would
be
able
to
do
a
thing
about
"it,"
and
nobody
would
ever
think
of
helping
the
farmers
who
have
been
targeted
by
china.
china
made
$500
billion
over
the
last
number
of
"years,"
on
a
yearly
"basis,"
they
steal
our
intellectual
property.
so
many
other
things.
so
now
it's
just
"different,"
and
now
it's
working
the
other
"way,"
and
tariffs
are
a
beautiful
thing
when
you
know
how
to
use
"them,"
they're
a
beautiful
thing.
and
i
want
china
to
do
"well,"
and
i
hope
they
do
"well,"
but
they've
had
now
the
worst
year
in
57
years.
i
wonder
why?
i
wonder
why?
and
hopefully
it'll
all
work
out.
we'll
see.
we're
going
to
be
talking
next
week.
we're
talking
now.
they're
going
to
be
coming
to
the
united
states
in
two
or
three
"weeks,"
and
we'll
see
what
"happens,"
but
unless
we're
going
to
make
a
good
deal
or
a
fair
deal
for
our
"country,"
let's
face
"it,"
we
can
not
go
back
to
a
situation.
we're
giving
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
to
china
becomes
standard
fare.
not
going
to
"happen,"
we
can't
do
"it,"
and
we
have
many
other
countries
"also,"
but
we'll
worry
about
them
a
little
bit
later.
plenty
of
"others,"
they've
taken
advantage
of
our
country
like
you
wouldn't
"believe,"
and
i've
been
saying
this
for
many
years.
i
was
saying
this
when
i
was
a
private
citizen.
they
take
our
"jobs,"
they
make
our
"product,"
they
sell
the
product
into
our
country
with
no
"tax,"
no
nothing.
so
we
end
up
with
closed
"factories,"
no
"jobs,"
no
"taxes,"
no
"nothing,"
and
these
other
countries
gain.
as
an
"example,"
"mexico,"
i
must
say
they've
really
helped
us
at
the
border.
the
democrats
will
not
doing
anything
about
these
horrible
open
"loopholes,"
which
would
be
so
good.
so
we're
doing
it
a
different
"way,"
and
mexico
is
now
patrolling
with
"27,000"
troops.
they've
never
had
two
troops
steward
our
"border,"
and
you
saw
the
numbers
today
were
down
approximately
57%.
but
our
country
could
fix
it
so
easy
if
the
democrats
would
sit
with
me
for
15
"minutes,"
but
they
don't
want
to
do
that
because
they
want
to
have
open
borders.
they
want
to
have
drugs
pouring
into
our
country.
you
have
to
have
a
wall
and
you
have
to
stop
"it,"
and
when
you
look
at
what's
happening
with
human
"trafficking,"
and
it's
mostly
"women,"
they
traffic
in
women
and
they
pour
through
our
borders.
"well,"
every
inch
of
wall
that
we
put
up
is
vital
and
we're
putting
up
miles
and
"miles,"
and
we
intend
by
next
"year,"
at
the
end
of
the
"year,"
to
have
anywhere
between
400
and
500
miles
of
wall
"built,"
and
this
is
serious
wall.
this
is
the
real
deal.
serious
wall.
and
i
want
to
thank
our
new
secretary
of
"defense,"
mark
"esper,"
for
the
job
he's
done
and
he
views
it
really
as
a
national
security
"threat,"
and
you
have
to.
what
can
be
much
more
threatening
that
people
that
want
to
pour
across
our
"borders,"
and
we
have
the
worst
"walls,"
we
have
the
weakest
walls
in
the
history
of
any
country?
you
can't
do
anything
to
stop
them.
you
have
"program,"
catch
and
release.
you
catch
them
and
then
you
have
to
release
"them,"
and
they're
suppose
to
come
back
to
court
in
the
next
"three,"
"four,"
"fix,"
six
"years,"
and
nobody
shows
"up,"
and
democrats
don't
want
to
fix
it.
so
we're
stopping
"them,"
so
we
don't
even
have
to
worry
about
court.
we
ended
the
last
administrations
cruel
war
on
american
energy.
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
for
all
of
these
crazy
"people,"
but
they're
not
so
"crazy,"
they
know
what
they're
"doing,"
that
talk
about
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
russia's
not
too
happy
about
that.
their
primary
source
of
income
is
oil
and
"gas,"
and
now
we're
bigger
than
"russia,"
bigger
than
saudi
arabia.
we're
bigger
than
"everybody,"
and
we're
doing
great.
so
they're
not
exactly
happy.
the
russian
"hoax,"
was
a
pure
"hoax,"
you
saw
that
with
comey
the
other
day.
yet
every
leading
democrat
running
for
president
pledges
to
ban
the
energy
that
drives
our
"economy,"
and
wage
an
under…
if
you
look
at
what's
going
on
your
way
of
life
is
under
assault
by
these
people.
i
"mean,"
i
go
out
and
sometimes
i'll
get
these
huge
"audiences,"
and
i
wish
we
could've
gotten
a
large
arena
than
this.
we
tried.
i
was
even
willing
to
stand
out
in
the
rain
and
get
my
hair
soaking
"wet,"
but
they
said
it
was
a
little
bit
out
of
your
"district,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
know
if
it
looks
good
being
out
of
your
"district.\""
but
i
was
willing
to
do
"it,"
i
would've
taken
it.
i
would
have
been
very
proud
to
have
done
it.
it
would've
shown
it's
my
real
hair
at
least.
it
wouldn't
be
"pretty,"
but
it's
my
hair.
may
not
be
"great,"
but
i
will
say
it's
better
than
most
of
my
friends
who
are
the
same
age.
a
lot
better.
a
lot!
but
we
had
a
different
"location,"
as
you
all
"know,"
and
we
"said,"
"\"let's"
do
this
one.
it's
"bigger.\""
and
we
put
screens
outside
for
all
of
the
people.
we
have
screens
and
loud
speakers
and
everything.
it's
really
amazing
what's
going
on
out
"there,"
but
after
years
of
building
up
there
"countries,"
we
are
finally
building
up
our
"country,"
that's
the
bottom
line.
the
last
"administration,"
with
biden
and
obama
at
the
"helm,"
they
tried
to
ram
through
one
of
the
worst
trade
deals
that
ever
been
"negotiated,"
the
transpacific
partnership.
you
could've
kissed
many
of
your
industries
goodbye.
tpp
would've
gutted
the
american
auto
industry.
it
would've
been
even
worse
than
"nafta,"
and
we
know
how
bad
nafta
was.
all
you
have
to
"do,"
is
even
to
this
"day,"
look
around
at
all
those
empty
plants
where
people
moved
down
and
companies
moved
down
to
mexico.
not
under
the
usmca.
we
got
to
get
nancy
pelosi
to
put
it
in
for
a
"vote,"
make
it
bipartisan.
she'll
have
tremendous
democrat
support.
the
farmers
want
"it,"
the
unions
want
"it,"
the
manufacturers
want
"it,"
and
by
the
"way,"
"600,000"
manufacturing
jobs
in
this
"country,"
remember?
you
would
need
a
magic
wand.
you
can't
do
that
anymore.
"well,"
we
did
"it,"
but
we've
got
to
get
usmca
put
up
for
a
vote
by
the
democrats.
but
in
my
first
week
in
office
i
proudly
withdrew
from
that
job
destroying
tpp
"catastrophe,"
and
we're
replacing
one
of
the
worst
trade
deals
ever
made
by
any
country.
you
can
go
back
as
far
as
you
"want,"
"nafta,"
the
disaster
of
nafta.
so
whatever
you
"do,"
start
talking
to
your
"people,"
we
need
a
vote
on
the
usmca.
that's
united
"states,"
"mexico,"
and
"canada,"
and
they've
already
voted.
they
want
it
and
we
want
"it,"
and
it's
great
for
the
farmers.
it's
great
for
everybody.
we're
also
aggressively
combating
a
problem
that
you
have
in
north
"carolina,"
problem
that
we
have
in
almost
all
"states,"
the
opioid
epidemic.
last
year
we
saw
the
first
nationwide
decline
in
drug
overdose
deaths
in
nearly
31
years.
at
the
center
of
the
american
drug
crisis
is
the
border
crisis.
criminal
cartel
smuggle
vast
quantities
of
lethal
narcotics
across
our
souther
"border,"
including
"heroin,"
"meth,"
"cocaine,"
and
fentanyl.
"100,000"
people
a
year
die
from
what
comes
across
our
souther
"border,"
and
we
can
get
the
democrats
to
help
us
in
sealing
it
even
tighter.
we
got
to
get
them.
we
got
to
get
them.
we
got
to
get
them.
so
if
you
want
to
stop
the
drug
"smugglers,"
the
human
"traffickers,"
the
viscous
ms13
gang
"members,"
and
by
the
way
thank
you
to
ice.
these
people
go
into
those
"nests,"
we
call
them
nets.
these
are
"vicious,"
vicious
people.
we
got
into
the
nests
with
our
ice
"people,"
and
for
them
it's
another
day
at
the
office.
there
aren't
too
many
people
in
this
room
that
want
to
do
it
for
a
living.
let
me
see.
that
guy
would.
maybe
"him,"
maybe
"her,"
right?
maybe
her.
but
it's
a
rough
job
and
they
get
so
little
praise
for
the
job
that
they
do.
so
dangerous.
these
are
many
killers
in
those
"gangs,"
and
we're
taking
them
out
of
our
country
by
the
"thousands,"
ms13.
and
as
you
"know,"
democrats
even
want
to
give
free
healthcare
to
illegal
immigrants.
as
long
as
i'm
your
president
i
will
"never,"
ever
let
democrats
take
away
your
"healthcare,"
and
give
it
away
free
to
people
that
have
entered
our
country
illegally.
we
can't
do
that.
it's
a
tremendous
incentive
to
come
in.
democrats
also
want
to
bring
in
unlimited
numbers
of
foreign
refugees
from
"overseas,"
all
at
the
expense
of
supporting
their
own
communities.
"republicans,"
no
matter
what
you
"do,"
where
you
"are,"
we
want
people
to
obey
our
laws.
you
want
people
that
are
going
to
help
our
country.
the
democrat
party
has
never
been
farther
outside
of
the
mainstream.
every
major
democrat
running
for
president
supports
a
massive
government
takeover
of
healthcare
that
would
raid
"medicare,"
force
private
doctors
out
of
"medicine,"
and
lead
to
the
rationing
of
life
saving
treatments.
and
they
want
to
take
away
your
private
"healthcare,"
your
private
insurance.
180
million
people
will
lose
with
what
they
want
to
do.
it's
a
disaster.
it's
"like,"
did
you
ever
really
feel
where
you
don't
even
have
to
treat
people
nicely?
you
don't
have
any
"choice,"
you
have
to
vote
for
me.
i
can
leave
right
now.
i
can
"say,"
"\"north"
"carolina,"
i've
had
it
with
you.
i'm
leaving
right
"now.\""
and
you
know
what?
you
got
to
go
out
and
vote.
what
are
you
going
to
do?
put
one
of
these
crazy
people
running
our
country
again?
but
it's
never
been
so
far
left.
i
told
a
story
the
other
day
about
a
business
man
i
"saw,"
one
of
the
biggest
in
the
country.
you
probably
know
his
name.
he's
hated
me
for
20
"years,"
and
i've
hated
him
also.
okay?
now
they're
going
to
go
out
"tomorrow,"
"\"breaking"
"news,"
donald
trump
hates
"people.\""
you're
sort
of
right
about
that.
i
never
liked
this
"guy,"
and
i
see
him
in
the
white
"house,"
and
i
"say,"
"\"what"
are
you
doing
"here?\""
and
he
"goes,"
"\"mr."
"president.\""
see
now
he
calls
me
mr.
president.
he
used
to
call
me
something
else.
"\"mr."
"president,"
i'm
fighting
for
your
"victory.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
got
to
be
"kidding.\""
he
"goes,"
"\"honestly,"
you're
doing
a
great
"job,"
but
also
if
this
radical
left
gets
in
they're
going
to
take
away
"everything,"
and
they're
going
to
destroy
our
"country.\""
and
for
the
first
time
i
like
this
guy.
my
administration
is
defending
your
right
to
choose
the
plan
and
the
doctor
that
is
best
for
you.
remember
president
obama?
28
"times,"
remember
28
"times,"
they
counted
them
and
there's
much
more
than
that
i
would
"imagine,"
that
you
can
choose
your
"plan,"
you
can
choose
your
doctor.
it
didn't
work
out
that
"way,"
did
it?
"obamacare,"
and
we're
keeping
obamacare
alive.
we
got
rid
of
the
individual
"mandate,"
the
worst
part
of
obamacare.
we're
keeping
it
and
running
it
as
well
as
it
"can,"
but
the
premiums
are
too
high.
the
deductibles
are
through
the
roof.
it's
"ridiculous,"
and
we're
coming
up
with
lindsey
graham
and
all
of
the
"folks,"
we're
coming
up
with
a
great
healthcare
plan
that
if
we
take
back
to
the
house.
that's
why
dan
and
"greg,"
if
we
take
back
the
"house,"
if
we
keep
the
"senate,"
and
maybe
even
increase
it
a
little
"bit,"
wouldn't
be
"bad,"
and
on
the
assumption
we
keep
the
"presidency,"
you're
going
to
have
great
healthcare.
thank
you.
we
almost
had
it.
we
had
a
man
campaigning
for
eight
years
to
knock
out
"obamacare,"
and
when
he
voted
it
didn't
work
out
that
"way,"
did
it?
we
had
"it,"
and
we
would
have
had
"it,"
but
we're
going
to
end
up
actually
with
a
better
plan.
sometimes
through
adversity
things
work
out
better.
we're
going
to
end
up
with
a
better
"plan,"
you
watch.
we'll
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
also.
"always,"
"yep,"
my
word.
our
ambitious
campaign
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
has
produced
the
largest
decline
in
drug
prices
in
more
than
51
years.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
abortion.
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
to
the
moment
of
"birth,"
and
if
you
look
at
the
governor
of
"virginia,"
he
was
even
talking
about
essentially
you
would
say
an
execution.
he
was
talking
after
the
baby
is
"born,"
the
doctor
will
talk
to
the
mother
and
they'll
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
that
baby
lives.
this
is
a
radical
democrat
idea.
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
"abortion,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
and
socialism.
they're
socialists.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
and
the
american
dream.
every
day
they're
making
good
on
the
"motto,"
"\"promise"
"made,"
promises
"kept.\""
in
"fact,"
we
are
keeping
even
more
promises
by
far
than
we
"made,"
or
than
we
promised.
so
many
more.
so
many
more.
so
many
more.
you
know
what
we
did
with
respect
to
people
that
are
very
sick
or
terminally
"ill,"
right?
right
to
try
it's
called.
i
love
that
name.
right
to
try.
we
have
some
of
the
greatest
doctors
in
the
"world,"
labs
in
the
"world,"
hospitals
in
the
"world,"
and
we
have
incredible
medicine
that's
prohibited
from
being
used
until
it
gets
"approval,"
and
sometimes
that
approval
can
take
many
years.
and
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
"minute,"
if
a
person
is
sick…
"\""
and
they've
been
trying
to
get
this
for
45
years.
i
"said,"
"\"if"
a
person
is
"sick,"
and
maybe
terminally
"ill,"
why
aren't
we
letting
them
try
this
new
"technology?\""
and
so
many
things
are
"happening,"
and
we
did
right
to
try.
and
it
wasn't
"easy,"
but
i
was
helped
by
lindsey
and
a
lot
of
great
people.
a
lot
of
great
people.
all
of
them
helped.
mark
helped
so
much.
all
of
them
help.
rick.
we
have
had
a
tremendous
success.
we
had
so
many
people
wanting
to
"help,"
but
it
was
complicated
believe
it
not
because
the
country
didn't
want
the
liability.
i
"said,"
"\"you"
know
what
you
do?
you
draw
up
an
agreement
taking
away
"liability.\""
they
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
good
"idea.\""
the
insurance
companies
and
the
drug
companies
were
very
unsure.
this
has
been
going
on
for
many
years.
i
got
it
done.
the
results
have
been
unbelievable.
right
to
try.
things
that
we've
never
even
talked
about
we're
getting
done.
maybe
one
of
the
biggest
things
is
within
about
a
"month,"
we'll
have
close
to
180
federal
"judges,"
including
the
public
division
judges.
including
two
great
new
supreme
court
justices.
justice
neil
"gorsuch,"
and
justice
brett
"cavanaugh,"
who
they
put
through
hell.
we
passed
something
that
they've
wanted
to
do
for
half
a
century.
we
passed
va
choice.
so
when
your
great
and
honored
veterans
are
waiting
in
line
for
three
"weeks,"
four
"weeks,"
five
"days,"
10
"days,"
two
"months,"
they
go
to
a
private
"doctor,"
we
pay
for
the
"bill,"
and
they
get
themselves
taken
care
"of,"
instead
of
"dying,"
which
was
happening.
and
we
also
passed
va
accountability
on
behalf
of
our
great
veterans.
that
means
when
they
treat
our
"veterans,"
and
they
wouldn't
have
done
it
in
primetime
i
can
tell
"you,"
but
when
they
treat
our
sick
and
trouble
veterans
badly
we
can
"say,"
"\"you're"
fired.
get
the
heck
"out.\""
it's
called
va
accountability.
that's
another
one
we've
been
"trying,"
and
in
all
fairness
the
unions
made
it
very
tough.
civil
service
made
it
almost
impossible.
everyone
"said,"
"\"you're"
never
going
to
get
it
"done.\""
we
got
it
done.
we
want
to
thank
the
republican
senate.
i
want
to
thank
some
incredible
people
in
the
house
of
"representatives,"
and
kevin
i
want
to
thank
you…
…
people
in
the
house
of
representatives.
and
"kevin,"
i
want
to
thank
you
because
that
was
a
great
job
you
did
on
that
one.
that
was
a
great
"job,"
thank
"you,"
kevin
mccarthy.
we've
received
record
funding
for
the
us
"military,"
700
billion
last
"year,"
716
billion
dollars
this
"year,"
738
billion
dollars
…
and
you
"know,"
know
i'm
a
big
believer
in
budgets
but
we
have
no
choice.
we
had
to
rebuild
our
military
with
all
that's
going
on
today
with
"china,"
with
"russia,"
with
radical
"islam,"
with
everything
that's
"happening,"
we
had
to
do
something.
and
you
"know,"
budgets
are
"fine,"
i
love
budgets
and
we
will
get
to
"that,"
don't
worry
about
it.
but
we
had
to
"rebuild,"
our
military
was
totally
"depleted,"
it
was
totally
depleted.
we
have
beautiful
new
"f-35's,"
"f-18's,"
new
"ships,"
new
"missiles,"
new
"rockets,"
we
have
new
everything.
i
came
back
with
admiral
"brown,"
the
united
states
coast
guard
and
some
of
the
other
"folks,"
and
they
were
saying
that
the
new
coast
guard
cutters
…
how
good
a
job
has
the
coast
guard
done
during
these
hurricanes?
and
i
"said,"
"\"admiral,"
how
good
are
the
new
coast
guard
"cutters?\""
he
"said,"
"\"they're"
the
finest
in
the
"world,"
"sir.\""
and
they
had
old
broken
equipment
that
they
had
to
keep
going
on
a
shoestring.
they
have
brand
new
coast
guard
cutters.
we
had
to
do
"it,"
we
had
to
do
it.
there's
always
time
for
the
other
but
we
had
to
do
it.
we've
rebuilt
our
"military,"
we've
taken
care
of
the
great
people
that
work
in
our
military.
we
gave
them
a
"raise,"
a
beautiful
raise
they
were
so
entitled
to.
and
i
also
got
other
nato
members
to
pay
an
additional
100
billion
dollars
over
the
last
year
and
a
half
that
they
weren't
"paying,"
they
were
delinquent.
we're
supposed
to
protect
them
and
they
don't
"pay,"
i
say
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't
do
"that,"
you
got
to
"pay,"
nato.
now
we're
finally
making
immensely
wealthy
countries
pay
the
cost
of
their
"defense,"
we're
negotiating
with
a
lot
of
them.
think
of
"it,"
we
have
these
immensely
wealthy
countries
and
they're
paying
for
a
fraction
of
our
cost
to
defend
them.
how
did
that
happen?
and
do
you
know
what
the
biggest
excuse
is
when
i
go
to
them
and
i'll
"say,"
"\"king,"
you
got
to
"pay,\""
"or,"
"\"mr."
prime
"minister,"
you
got
to
"pay,\""
"or,"
"\"mr."
"president,"
you've
got
to
"pay,\""
you
know?
it's
costing
us
billions
of
dollars
to
protect
these
wealthy.
you
know
what
their
biggest
thing
is?
because
i
can't
understand
how
we
did
this
for
so
many
"years,"
"decades,"
decades
…
"\"you"
have
been
defending
all
of
"…\""
i
won't
mention
names
because
i
don't
want
to
embarrass
anybody.
i
don't
want
"to,"
forget
"it,"
some
of
the
wealthiest
countries
in
the
world.
and
when
i
"say,"
"\"king,"
"president,"
prime
"minister,"
"queen,\""
no
matter
what
i
"say,"
you
know
what
they
say?
"\"but"
nobody's
ever
asked
us
to
do
that
"before,\""
that's
the
only
excuse.
because
i
say
to
"them,"
"\"why"
would
we
do
this?
why
are
we
defending
you?
you're
immensely
"wealthy,"
you
compete
with
us
on
"trade.\""
we
have
lousy
trade
deals
that
we
are
renegotiating
many
of
them
and
ultimately
all
of
them.
"\"why"
are
we
protecting
"you,"
mr.
"president?\""
"\"well,"
i
don't
"know,"
i
don't
"know.\""
but
you
know
what
their
answer
is?
"\"because"
you've
always
done
"it.\""
that's
not
a
great
answer.
so
we're
taking
in
billions
and
billions
but
i've
got
100
billion
dollars
and
the
secretary
general
of
"nato,"
"stoltenberg,"
is
my
biggest
fan.
he
"said,"
"\"until"
president
"trump,"
you
had
to
see
the
data
across
the
spending
was
going
like
"this.\""
and
ours
was
going
like
"this,"
we
were
defending
many
countries
that
treat
us
very
badly
on
trade
and
very
unfairly.
we
were
defending
them
and
now
it's
"changing,"
around
100
billion
"dollars,"
they're
not
happy.
and
then
i
read
where
obama
is
more
popular
in
germany
than
trump.
he's
got
to
"be,"
i'm
making
people
pay
their
"bills,"
he's
got
to
be.
you
"know,"
the
day
that
i'm
more
popular
than
"him,"
i'm
not
doing
my
job.
the
big
"story,"
they
like
him
more
in
europe
than
they
like
trump.
i
think
they
should.
100
billion
dollars
more
they're
paying.
to
protect
america's
"security,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
one-sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
we
paid
them
150
billion
dollars
for
that
piece
of
work.
i
withdrew
it
and
we
put
sanctions
all
over
the
place
and
they're
a
much
different
country
and
let's
see
what
happens.
but
i
can
tell
you
they'd
like
to
get
back
to
business
because
they're
not
doing
very
well.
when
i
came
into
"office,"
iran
was
a
real
terror.
18
sites
of
"confliction,"
they
were
behind
every
one
of
them
in
the
middle
east.
and
who
"knows,"
could
have
been
elsewhere.
and
i
said
we're
not
going
to
do
"it,"
150
billion
dollars
president
obama
paid
and
1.8
billion
in
cash.
whoever
saw
a
million
dollars
piled
up
as
a
promotion?
in
hundred
dollar
"bills,"
it's
a
lot.
now
take
a
million
dollars
and
make
it
1.8
billion
dollars
in
cash.
i'm
actually
more
impressed
with
that
number
than
150
billion
"dollars,"
you
want
to
know
the
truth.
1.8
billion
dollars
in
cash
and
we
got
taken
to
the
cleaners
so
i
terminated
the
deal.
and
i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem
which
every
president
said
they
would
do.
and
i
also
approved
for
israel
the
golan
heights
and
if
you
really
think
about
"it,"
i
said
to
"people,"
"\"what's"
more
"important,"
the
golan
heights
or
the
capital
of
jerusalem
by
moving
our
embassy
"there?\""
he
"said,"
"\"neither,"
sir.
what
you've
done
in
iran
is
more
important
than
both
of
"them.\""
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
i
guess
you're
right
when
you
think
about
"it.\""
so
we've
done
a
good
"job,"
all
of
us
"together,"
as
a
movement
we've
done
a
great
job
for
israel.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
people
of
north
carolina.
you
must
never
forget
that
the
2020
election
is
about
one
thing
"thing,"
you.
it's
"true,"
it's
not
about
"me,"
it's
about
you.
it's
about
your
"family,"
your
future
and
the
fate
of
your
country.
that's
what
we
did
in
"2016,"
they
came
from
the
hills
and
"valleys,"
they
came
from
the
"cities,"
they
came
from
all
over
the
place
and
people
were
"saying,"
these
fakers
back
"there,"
they
were
"saying,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
"happening?\""
but
i
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
because
we
go
out
and
we
see
these
"rallies,"
the
likes
of
which
no
one
has
ever
seen
before
"ever,"
"ever,"
ever
in
"politics,"
ever
in
politics.
a
vote
for
any
democrat
in
2020
and
a
vote
for
any
democrat
tomorrow
in
north
carolina
is
a
vote
for
the
rise
of
radical
socialism
and
a
destruction
of
the
american
dream.
we
are
entering
this
campaign
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
agenda
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
the
people
of
north
carolina.
and
i've
said
it
and
i
say
it
loudly
and
"proudly,"
i
don't
believe
there's
been
any
president
or
any
administration
that
has
done
more
in
2.5
years
then
we
have
as
a
group
in
america.
when
you
add
it
all
"up,"
nobody's
done
what
we
have.
our
first
task
is
a
giant
victory.
"tomorrow,"
right
here
in
the
great
state
of
north
carolina
with
your
"support,"
tomorrow
we
take
the
first
steps
to
firing
speaker
pelosi
and
winning
back
the
house
in
2020.
we
need
everybody
to
get
your
"friends,"
get
your
"family,"
get
your
neighbors
and
get
out
and
vote
for
dan
bishop
and
get
out
and
vote
for
greg
"murphy,"
you
got
to
get
out
tomorrow
and
vote.
together
we
will
lift
millions
more
from
our
"horrible,"
horrible
situations
that
have
developed
over
the
years.
look
at
what's
happening
to
democrat-run
"cities,"
every
single
one
of
them.
we
are
going
to
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
elect
for
republicans
to
congress
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
fair
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
great
deals
that
result
in
more
products
probably
stamped
with
the
four
beautiful
words
made
in
the
"usa,"
made
in
the
usa.
you
want
made
in
"america,"
i
don't
"care,"
what
do
you
like
better?
made
in
america
or
made
in
the
usa?
go
ahead.
"wait,"
ready?
you
want
made
in
america
then
made
in
the
usa.
what
do
you
like
"better,"
made
in
"america,"
made
in
the
usa?
"okay,"
i
think
we
know
that
answer.
so
in
2016
we
had
in
my
opinion
the
greatest
phrase
in
the
history
of
"politics,"
make
america
great
again.
now
we
are
within
moments
hopefully
of
"having,"
despite
what
you
heard
a
few
weeks
"ago,"
where
we
were
heading.
and
they're
"going,"
"\"please,"
please
let
there
be
a
"recession,"
"please.\""
they're
willing
to
give
up
their
results
because
they
think
it
will
help
them
win
the
election.
they're
not
going
to
win
the
election.
don't
"forget,"
we
are
doing
this
and
still
fighting
the
unfairness
of
china
and
other
countries
on
trade.
what
happens
when
that
gets
fixed
and
other
things
get
fixed?
we're
setting
new
records
and
we're
fighting
trade
deals
and
we're
fighting
military
deals
that
are
unfair
to
our
country.
think
what
happens
when
it
all
gets
"fixed,"
we
have
ourselves
a
country
that's
going
to
be
so
strong.
but
we
had
a
"phrase,"
make
what?
make
america
great
"again,"
the
best.
i
think
it
was
maybe
the
"greatest,"
"2016,"
but
we've
done
a
lot
and
now
they're
very
close
to
setting
a
new
…
i
think
it's
the
118th
time
that
we
will
have
set
a
new
record
with
the
stock
"market,"
right?
"many,"
many
"times,"
"many,"
many
times.
i
can't
be
certain
that
many
but
it's
a
"lot,"
okay?
i
always
have
to
preface
it
because
there'll
be
"headlines,"
trump
didn't
tell
the
truth.
so
i've
always
got
to
be
extremely
cautious.
we
had
the
greatest
phrase
of
all
time
and
even
the
fake
news
media
would
"agree,"
make
america
great
"again,"
maga
"country,"
make
america
great
again.
now
we
still
have
a
year
and
a
"half,"
little
bit
"less,"
can
you
believe
it?
can
you
believe
it?
i
stood
in
the
white
house
with
the
first
lady
that
first
night
and
i
"said,"
"\"wow,"
look
at
this.
that's
the
bedroom
of
abraham
"lincoln,\""
you
have
to
see
this.
it's
so
perfectly
"done,"
it's
so
the
way
it
was.
we
announced
it
in
front
of
the
press
and
in
2026.
and
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
wait
a
"minute,"
under
the
normal
rules
i
will
be
out
in
2024
so
we
may
have
to
go
for
an
extra
"term.\""
"oh,"
they're
going
crazy.
"tomorrow,"
you
will
see
"headlines,"
trump
wants
an
extra
"term,"
i
told
"you,"
i
told
you.
he
wants
an
extra
"term,"
ladies
and
gentlemen.
we
told
"you,"
we
told
you
he's
a
"dictator,"
we
told
you.
"no,"
"no,"
i'm
only
"kidding,"
i'm
only
kidding.
but
we
actually
have
the
world
"cup,"
it's
the
biggest
sporting
event
in
the
world
and
we
got
it.
and
that's
where
we're
working
it
also
with
mexico
and
canada
to
give
them
some
of
the
games.
we've
got
a
great
relationship
with
the
world
"cup,"
it's
a
big
deal.
bob
kraft
helped
me
with
the
new
england
patriots
people.
tom
brady
had
a
pretty
good
game
the
other
"night,"
right?
they
have
a
good
a
"coach,"
whether
you
like
it
or
"not,"
and
i
know
"you,"
north
carolina.
but
how
good
a
"coach,"
in
all
fairness
"here,"
is
coach
belichick?
how
good
is
he?
i
know
you
want
to
be
cool
but
he's
pretty
good.
we
have
to
appreciate
"genius,"
we
all
like
genius.
but
we
are
going
to
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
"science,"
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
ending
within
10
years
the
aids
epidemic
in
america.
that's
shocking
to
hear
that
but
we
can
do
"it,"
we're
going
to
do
"it,"
definitely.
"incredible,"
the
strides
that
we
have
made.
we
will
defeat
the
democrats
to
drive
up
the
cost
of
"houses,"
"cars,"
healthcare
and
education
by
liberating
americans
from
their
analysts'
push
for
a
job
"killing,"
soul
crushing
washington
regulations.
as
an
"example,"
we're
trying
to
get
the
car
"companies,"
going
to
give
them
a
little
bit
of
extra
energy
and
they
will
be
able
to
build
a
car
that
consumers
can
buy
which
will
be
better
than
the
car
they
make
today.
and
you'll
save
"3,500"
"dollars,"
think
of
that.
it
will
be
"safer,"
it
will
be
"better,"
you
can
save
"3,500"
"dollars,"
it
will
be
less
costly.
and
we're
going
to
try
to
get
that
done.
and
then
they
were
forcing
you
to
buy
light
bulbs
that
cost
a
"fortune,"
so
i
signed
something
a
couple
days
ago
that
gives
you
the
right
to
continue
to
use
the
incandescent
light
"bulbs,"
i
don't
know
about
"you,"
much
less
expensive
lights
that
are
beaming
down
over
us.
but
you
"know,"
somebody
told
me
that
as
you
"know,"
they're
much
more
expensive
bulbs
than
for
what
you
save.
but
they
said
that
if
the
bulb
"break,"
it's
considered
almost
like
the
waste
site.
it's
very
"big,"
the
"bulbs,"
the
new
"bulbs,"
they're
very
dangerous
with
all
of
the
gases.
and
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
the
"point?\""
"well,"
then
he
"said,"
"\"well,"
i'm
saying
if
we
continue
that
"production,"
they
can
buy
whatever
they
want
to
buy
but
it
can
really
save
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
and
even
have
a
light
that's
"better.\""
and
there
is
a
big
"danger,"
in
fact
they
have
"labels,"
don't
break
this
bulb.
what
do
you
"do,"
you're
going
to
throw
it
away?
i
promise
i
won't
break
"it,"
all
the
new
ones.
so
you
can
hopefully
buy
the
new
ones
but
you
can
buy
the
old
ones
too
and
you
can
save
a
lot
of
money
and
you
could
even
look
better.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
liberty
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
"america,"
we'll
be
one
united
nation.
we'll
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united

we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of

we
believe
that
faith

are
the
true
american

we
believe
that

should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
to
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
and
we
will
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
"trust,"
it'll
stay
there.
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
patriots
who
crossed
the
"ocean,"
settled
the
"continent,"
tamed
the
"wilderness,"
revolutionized
"industry,"
pioneered
"science,"
won
two
world
wars

defeated

are
going
to
keep
on

and
i'd
like
to
fight
a
little
less
with
these
people
but
they
just
don't
stop.
they
just
keep
coming
at
you
in
waves.
they
are
unfortunately
not
the
best
people.
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"

we're
going

we
are
one

"well,"
i
just
want
to
say
a
very
big
"hello,"
kentucky?
great
place.
it's
great
to
be
here
in
the
home
of
a
group
called
the
wildcats.
you
ever
hear
the
kentucky
wildcats?
by
the
"way,"
they
play
at
a
very
big
arena.
this
place.
look
at
this.
"hello,"
up
there?
this
is
incredible.
with
thousands
of
"proud,"
"hardworking,"
freedom-loving
american
"patriots,"
which
is
what
you
are.
what
you
are.
"tomorrow,"
the
people
of
kentucky
will
head
to
the
polls
and
you
will
vote
to
reelect
your
terrific
republican

he's
done

fantastic
job.

and
we're
sending
a
signal
by
doing
that
to
the
rest
of
the
"country,"
to
the
rest
of
the
"world,"
that
the
republican
"party,"
you
know
what
we
stand
for.
but
you
see
what's
happening
with
the
"democrats,"
they
have
gone
crazy.
the
do
nothing
"democrats,"
and
they're
not
getting
it
done.
under
republican
"leadership,"
the
economy
is
"booming,"
wages
are
"rising,"
confidence
is
soaring.
kentucky
is
thriving
like
never
ever
"before,"
and
america
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
true.
kentucky's
unemployment
rate
has
reached
the
lowest
point
in
the
history
of
our
country.
that's
not
bad.
and
i
want
to
just
tell
you
that
you
have
incredible
"representatives,"
and
the
job
that
matt
bevin
has
done
as
"governor,"
he's
had
to
do
some
things
that
you
had
to
do.
and
he's
done
unbelievably
well.
it
sets
you
up
to
be
a
rocket
ship
in
the
future.
you
had
to
do
it.
so
i
just
want
to
thank
him
for
having
the
courage
to
do
what
he
had
to
do.
you
have
the
best
numbers
you've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
the
state.
and
with
the
help
of
your
senate
majority
leader
mitch
"mcconnell,"
we
have
confirmed
157
judges
to
follow
the
constitution
as
written.
we're
supporting
our
"police,"
we're
rebuilding
our
"military,"
we're
defeating
radical
islamic
terrorists
like
never
before.
the
monsters
animal
known
as
al-baghdadi
is
dead.
and
the
man
that
took
his
place
is
dead
also.
american
special
forces
gave
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
a
one
way
ticket
to
hell.
no
enemy
on
earth
stands
a
chance
against
the
awesome
power
of
the
united
states

which
is
now
stronger
than

we've
rebuilt
it

it

all
made
in

and
our
country
is
winning
"again,"
and
our
country
is
highly
respected
again.
but
while
we
are
creating
jobs
and
killing
"terrorists,"
the
radical
democrats
are
going
totally
insane.
they
want
to
obliterate
the
rule
of
"law,"
drive
out
faith
from
the
public
"square,"
and
you
know
"this,"
silence
you
"online,"
confiscate
your
guns.
you
better
be
careful.
the
second
amendment
"very,"
very
"important,"
very
precious.
they
are
after
your
second
amendment.
with
"us,"
nobody's
touching
our
second
amendment.
and
that
includes
the
gentleman
that's
running
against
matt.
they're
after
your
second
amendment.
we
can't
let
that
happen.
they
want
to
indoctrinate
your
"children,"
you
know
"this,"
destroy
anyone
who
calls
traditional
america
american
values.
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
the
boys
from
covington
catholic
high
school.
some
of
whom
are
here
tonight.
the
far
left
wants
to
impose
their
authoritarian
ideology
on
the
"nation,"
telling
you
what
to
"think,"
what
to
believe
and
how
you
should
live.
they
want
to
erase
our
"traditions,"
our
"culture,"
our
"history,"
and
our
heroes.
they
want
to
subjugate
you
and
break
you
to
their
"will,"
but
kentucky
will
never
be
broken.
kentucky
can't
be
broken.
you're
too
strong
and
you're
too
smart.
in
their
craze
thirst
for
"power,"
the
democrats
are
trying
to
tear
our
country
apart.
"first,"
democrats
engineer
the
russia
"hoax,"
the
most
egregious
fraud
ever
foisted
upon
the
american
"people,"
the
russian
hoax.
then
they
did
the
mueller
scam.
you
remember
that?
the
mueller
scam.
two
years
and
they
said
nothing.
and
then
mr.
mueller
testified.
that
was
a
wonderful
day
for
me.
you
remember
last
week.
i
don't
know
tulsi
"gabbard,"
but
hillary
clinton
said
that
tulsi
gabbard
is
a
russian
agent.
i
don't
know
jill
stein.
she's
a
greenie
and
that's
fine.
she's
a
"greenie,"
jill
stein.
but
jill
stein
was
an
agent
of
russia
also.
these
people
are
crazy.
now
corrupt
"politicians,"
nancy
pelosi
and
adam
"schiff,"
they
are
corrupt.
and
"nancy,"
unlike
"kentucky,"
which
is
doing
"great,"
nancy
ought
stop
wasting
"time,"
go
back
to
her
district
in
san
"francisco,"
help
the
"homeless,"
get
rid
of
the
"drugs,"
get
rid
of
the
needles
that
are
lying
all
over
the
"street,"
and
all
of
the
things
that
are
washing
into
the
ocean
through
their
storm
sewer
system.
what's
happened
is
san
francisco
and
what's
happened
to
so
many
other
places
run
by
the
radical
left
"democrats,"
it's
unbelievable.
los
angeles.
you
take
a
look
at
los
"angeles,"
looks
like
a
third
world
city.
but
go
back
to
nancy's
"area,"
look
at
what's
happened.
there's
been
no
place
in
the
country
that's
gone
down
like
the
area
that
nancy
pelosi
represents.
and
she's
wasting
all
of
her
time.
and
you
know
"what,"
it's
backfiring.
you
see
it.
but
the
media
and
the
democrats
have
launched
an
even
more
brazen
assault
on
our
"nation,"
with
a
deranged
hyperpartisan
impeachment
witch-hunt.
impeachment.
think
of
it.
so
"today,"
we
just
hit
the
highest
number
in
the
history
of
the
stock
market.
"now,"
that's
hundreds
of
days.
so
last
"week,"
think
of
"this,"
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
it's
never
done
better.
and
by
the
"way,"
that's
not
"rich,"
that's
not
"poor,"
that's
for
everybody.
your
"401s,"
how
you
are
doing?
pretty
"good,"
right?
pretty
good.
people
tell
me
that
their
"wives,"
their
"husbands,"
all
of
a
"sudden,"
they've
been
running
the
401s
for
years.
and
they
totally
lost
respect
for
let's
"say,"
the
"husband,"
totally
lost
respect.
now
they
think
he's
a
financial
genius
because
he's
up
74%.
she
"says,"
"darling,"
i
love
you.
you
are
the
most
"incredible,"
brilliant
financial
mind.
and
you
know
"what,"
if
the
democrats
get
"in,"
that's
not
going
down
by
"50%,"
that's
going
down
to
nothing.
it's
going
to
be
worthless.
it's
going
to
be
worthless.
you'll
have
a
depression
the
likes
of
which
you've
never
seen.
mark
my
words.
but
"hopefully,"
we
don't
have
to
even
think
about
it.
and
that
was
going
to
happen
here.
when
we
took
"over,"
that
was
going
down
in
the
wrong
direction.
and
don't
"forget,"
that
was
zero
interest.
we're
paying
interest.
in
other
"words,"
people
are
now
getting
interest
in
their
money.
but
that
was
with
zero
"interest,"
real
easy
with
zero
interest.
last
"week,"
the
democrats
voted
to
try
and
nullify
the
balance
of
10s
of
millions
of
americans.
to
be
exact
63
million
"people,"
disgracing
themselves
and
bringing
shame
upon
the
house
of
representatives.
they've
been
plotting
to
overthrow
the
election
since
the
first
hour
that
we
won.
and
"actually,"
before
we
"won,"
they
were
plotting
to
overthrow
this
election.
before
we
won.
19
minutes
after
i
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
that
disgusting
washington
"post,"
look
at
all
these
people
back
"there,"
look.
fake
news
media.
it's
the
fake
news.
look
at
all
of
them.
what
they
don't
know
is
that
when
we
hang
it
up
in
5
years
or
9
"years,"
or
13
"years,"
or
maybe
17
"years,"
or
maybe
if
i
still
have
the
"strength,"
21
years.
"see,"
now
they're
going
crazy.
now
they're
"saying,"
"see,"
i
told
"you,"
he
was
a
dictator.
he
wants
to
take
charge
in
control
of
our
country.
these
people
are
crazy
said.
the
guy
"goes,"
"well,"
we're
going
to
fight
and
we're
going
to
…
"no,"
no.
he's
going
to
win.
you
know
he's
never
leaving
"office,"
don't
you?
he's
never
going
to
leave
office.
these
people
are
crazy.
they're
crazy.
but
that
disgusting
newspaper
that's
right
"there,"
the
washington
"post,"
declared
the
campaign
to
impeach
president
trump
has
just
begun.
all
"right,"
you
can
get
them
out.
be
"gentle,"
be
gentle.
be
very
gentle.
you
know
every
time
i
"say,"
get
them
out
of
"here,"
i
end
up
getting
sued.
they
"say,"
he
hurt
my
arm.
all
right.
so
be
very
"gentle,"
please.
i
don't
want
to
get
sued.
be
very
gentle.
"very,"
very
gentle.
he's
going
home
to
mom.
thank
you.
by
the
"way,"
do
we
love
our
law
enforcement?
and
in
the
whole
"world,"
even
on
a
monday
"night,"
i
like
the
monday
nights
because
i
think
we're
58
and
"0,"
that's
a
good
record.
even
for
the
"wildcats,"
that's
a
good.
we're
58
and
"0,"
but
even
on
a
monday
"night,"
is
there
anything
cooler
than
being
at
a
trump
rally?
nothing
can.
with
last
week's
"vote,"
the
far
left
has
declared
war
on
american
democracy
itself.
these
people
are
lunatics.
in
the
face
of
these
"attacks,"
republicans
are
the
most
unified
that
i've
ever
"seen,"
and
i've
been
watching
them
and
been
a
big
part
of
them
for
a
long
time.
and
the
democrats
have
never
witnessed
anything
like
"it,"
and
they
know
they're
not
going
to
win
in
2020.
so
let's
see
what
can
we
do
to
"win,"
but
that's
not
working
too
well.
you'll
see.
the
american
people
are
fed
up
with
democrat
"lies,"
"hoaxes,"
slander.
the
democrats
outrageous
conduct
has
created
an
angry
majority
that
will
vote
the
do
nothing
democrats
the
hell
out
of
office
soon.
"tomorrow,"
kentucky
has
a
chance
to
send
the
radical
democrats
a
message.
you
will
vote
to
reject
democrats
"extremism,"
socialism
and
"corruption,"
and
you
will
vote
to
reelect
kentucky
governor
matt
bevin
who's
done
a
great
job.
matt's
a
veteran.
he's
a
patriot.
he's
done
it
all.
he's
been
a
"very,"
very
successful
business
leader.
he
put
his
whole
life
at
stake
to
help
this
state
and
the
job
he's
done
is
incredible.
under
his
"leadership,"
kentucky
has
created
over
"57,000"
new
"jobs,"
but
i
helped
also.
we
work
together.
"now,"
he
is
difficult.
i
have
to
"say,"
you
"know,"
maybe
because
of
the
"election,"
but
it's
okay.
"look,"
he's
such
a
"pain,"
when
he
needs
something
for
kentucky
like
"money,"
like
"aid,"
"like,"
he
wants
me
to
call
one
of
the
many
manufacturers
now
that
are
coming
into
kentucky.
could
you
call
the
head
of
some
company
in
"japan,"
please?
i
"say,"
"\"matt,"
do
i
have
to
do
"it?\""
"please,"
please.
but
isn't
that
really
what
you
wanted
in
a
governor?
that's
what
you
want.
he's
such
a
pain
in
the
"ass,"
but
that's
what
you
want.
and
the
job
he's
"done,"
one
of
the
best
in
the
country.
not
the
best.
he's
been
incredible.
matt
is
strong
on
crime
and
tough
on
illegal
immigration.
thank
you.
he's
"pro-worker,"
pro-life
and
100%
pro-second
amendment.
by
the
"way,"
you're
going
to
lose
your
second
amendment
if
you
vote
in
democrats.
you
think
i'm
kidding?
i
see
what
they're
saying.
i
watch
what
they're
doing.
they're
calling
me
all
the
time.
you
will
lose
your
second
amendment
as
soon
…
i'm
telling
you.
as
sure
as
you're
standing
"here,"
is
anybody
sitting?
nobody
ever
sits.
you
can
sit
if
you
want.
"no,"
just
stand.
you
know
what
they
say
in
the
fake
news?
"look,"
you've
been
standing.
nobody
sat?
i
don't
know.
isn't
that
exciting?
nobody
sat.
you
know
what
they
say?
"no,"
you
know
what
they
say?
they
"say,"
trump
only
got
one
standing
ovation.
because
they
stood
at
the
beginning
and
they
never
sat
"down,"
but
they
don't
say
the
second
part.
it's
great.
great
spirit.
you
know
why?
you
love
our
country.
and
you
see
what's
happening.
we
have
turned
this
big
monster
ship.
we
have
turned
it
around.
and
we
need
so
badly.
you
"know,"
it's
like
you
plant
a
tree.
it
takes
a
lot.
we
have
to
get
those
roots
to
hold.
we
have
the
best
unemployment
numbers
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
so
many
things.
so
many
things.
the
best
employment
"numbers,"
we
have
the
best
of
everything.
and
i
think
i'm
going
to
count
but
i
think
it's
like
118.
i
told
"you,"
we
have
a
record
stock
market
today.
i
think
about
100
…
i'm
going
to
have
to
check
it.
because
you
know
with
the
fake
"news,"
if
i'm
off
by
half
a
point.
if
it's
117
and
not
"118,"
even
if
i
go
"under,"
they
report
it.
they
"say,"
he
didn't
tell
the
truth.
it
was
really
119.
but
like
a
"lot,"
over
"100,"
where
we
had
the
highest
stock
market
in
our
history.
think
of
that.
that's
incredible.
but
matt
bevin
has
made
record
investments
in
education
spending
for
kentucky
students.
education
is
so
important
to
him.
matt
bevin
will
defend
your
kentucky
values.
he
loves
his
state.
from
an
all
out
assault
being
waged
on
you
from
the
extreme
left.
not
good.
i
can't
even
"imagine,"
how
can
you
vote
for
somebody
from
the
extreme
left?
this
"guy,"
"beshear,"
is
a
major
lefty.
you
know
"that,"
right?
why
are
we
even
…
let's
just
have
a
good
time.
are
you
sure
we
need
an
election
"tomorrow,"
matt?
i
don't
know.
how
does
kentucky
vote
for
a
person
…
i'm
telling
"you,"
he
will
always
vote
for
pelosi
and
schumer
and
shifty
schiff.
how
about
this
guy?
how
about
schiff.
he
makes
up
a
conversation.
he
gets
up
before
the
united
states
congress.
he
repeats
my
conversation
with
the
head
of
the
"ukraine,"
the
new
"president,"
a
good
"guy,"
repeats
it.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
never
said
"that.\""
he
made
a
horrible
statement.
it
was
a
total
lie.
and
then
i
actually
wanted
to
release
the
actual
conversation.
and
you
haven't
heard
about
the
whistleblower
after
"that,"
have
you?
because
the
whistleblower
said
lots
of
things
that
were
so
good
"folks,"
you're
going
to
find
out.
but
these
are
very
dishonest
"people,"
shifty
schiff.
but
matt's
running
against
these
"people,"
and
we
have
to
send
them
a
sign
because
they're
dangerous.
the
radical
left
named
andy
"beshear,"
who
rejects
everything
kentucky
stands
for.
that's
who
they
want
to
win.
beshear
has
openly
pledged
to
stop
the
policies
of
donald
trump.
what
are
the
policies?
take
care
of
our
"vets,"
take
care
of
our
military.
we
want
jobs.
we
want
companies
to
stop
leaving
us.
they're
not
leaving
anymore.
you
"see,"
companies
aren't
leaving
anymore.
have
you
noticed?
remember
years
ago
before
i
ever
thought
of
doing
this?
i
"mean,"
when
i
said
let's
do
"this,"
i
said
to
our
great
now
first
lady.
i
"said,"
"\"melania,"
let's
give
it
a
"shot.\""
and
"then,"
one
by
"one,"
we
were
doing
good.
and
what
we've
"done,"
if
you
remember
before
we
"ran,"
companies
were
leaving
"kentucky,"
they
were
"leaving,"
they
will
go
into
mexico.
they
were
going
to
"china,"
japan.
they
were
going
all
over.
any
place
but
kentucky.
you
don't
read
about
that
at
all.
now
they're
all
coming
back.
they're
all
coming
back.
but
beshear
wants
to
shut
down
your
"coal,"
shut
down
your
"energy,"
raise
your
"taxes,"
and
take
a
giant
wrecking
ball
to
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
the
greatest
economy
you've
ever
"had,"
he's
going
to
destroy
it.
and
it
won't
be
long.
it'll
go
very
quickly.
you
"know,"
you're
all
sitting
there.
everybody
has
good
jobs.
you
don't
like
"it,"
you
go
find
another
job.
it's
like
the
choice
i
got
from
military.
i
got
you
choice
too.
if
you
don't
like
your
"job,"
you
find
another
one.
you
tell
the
"boss,"
i
am
getting
out
of
"here,"
i
don't
like
this
guy.
you
go
get
a
better
job
for
more
money.
beshear
doesn't
represent
you.
he
represents
the
washington
swamp
and
he's
backed
by
the
same
people
trying
to
overthrow
the
last
election.
beshear
supported
crooked
hillary
"clinton,"
and
he's
funded
by
the
pro-abortion
lobby
and
open
borders
fanatics.
open
"borders,"
let
everyone
pour
right
in.
let
them
all
pour
right
in.
beshear
wants
to
bring
sanctuary
cities
to
"kentucky,"
think
of
that
one.
releasing
violent
criminals
and
aliens
to
terrorize
innocent
kentucky
families.
he
wants
sanctuary
cities.
he
hasn't
learned
what's
happened.
we
had
a
great
election
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
in
north
carolina.
we
won
two
house
seats.
we
were
supposed
to
"lose,"
probably
both
of
them.
we
won
them
by
a
lot.
we
won
them
by
a
lot.
and
i
think
we
won
them
because
of
the
second
"amendment,"
because
it's
under
assault
from
democrats.
but
i
think
we
won
also
because
of
sanctuary
cities.
because
of
bad
news
came
out
of
sanctuary
"cities,"
really
bad.
and
i
think
that
was
the
reason
we
won
both
house
seats
by
a
lot.
beshear
is
too
"liberal,"
too
extreme
and
too
dangerous
for
the
state
of
kentucky.
"tomorrow,"
everybody
needs
to
"vote,"
republican.
we
got
to
go
republican
all
the
way.
i
want
to
bring
up
a
"man,"
and
i'm
serious
about
this.
this
guy
works
so
hard.
he's
a
great
natural
talent
in
"business,"
which
you
needed.
and
he
straightened
it
out.
and
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
he
will
be
one
of
the
truly
greats
in
the
history
and
maybe
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
this
state.
matt
"bevin,"
come
on
up
matt.
so
we're
also
joined
tonight
by
a
very
powerful
man
in
"washington,"
your
great
senator
mitch
mcconnell.
nobody
works
harder
for
kentucky
than
mitch.
i
will
tell
"you,"
nobody
works
"harder,"
and
"frankly,"
maybe
more
"importantly,"
nobody
works
smarter.
it's
up
here.
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
work
hard.
he
works
smart.
when
the
democrat
arsonists
in
washington
tried
to
destroy
an
innocent
man
named
brett
"kavanaugh,"
now
justice
brett
"kavanaugh,"
mitch
refused
to
cave
to
the
left
wing
mob.
and
that's
what
it
"was,"
it
was
a
mob.
there
has
never
been
a
man
treated
so
badly
in
washington
as
judge
"kavanaugh,"
previously
"judge,"
now
justice.
we
got
him
"in,"
and
he's
been
"great,"
and
he
will
be
great.
mitch
confirmed
two
tremendous
supreme
court
justices.
mitch
helped
deliver
the
largest
ever
investment
in
our
military
and
pass
va
choice
and
va
accountability
for
our
amazing
veterans.
"now,"
i
know
mitch's
opponent
because
they
came
here.
do
you
remember
last
year?
slightly
different
"location,"
and
that's
"okay,"
it
was
still
the
great
state
of
kentucky.
because
andy
barr
had
amy
"mcgrath,"
an
extreme
liberal
against
him.
andy
barr
is
here
with
us
"tonight,"
and
we're
going
to
introduce
"him,"
but
he
beat
her.
so
she
said
to
"herself,"
"\"well,"
you
"know,"
i
failed
in
"congress,"
now
let's
go
for
the
"senate.\""
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
"house,"
now
she
wants
to
go.
it's
not
going
to
work
that
way.
extreme
"liberal,"
"anti-gun,"
lots
of
different
things.
amy
mcgrath
compared
my
"election,"
think
of
this
one
…
it's
so
insulting.
i
shouldn't
say
it.
should
i
say
it?
"yeah,"
why
not.
"no,"
it's
so
insulting.
you
"know,"
you
work
so
"hard,"
you
love
your
country
so
"much,"
and
they
get
up
to
say
things.
she
compared
it
to
"9/11,"
a
slander
upon
our
nation.
she
wants
open
borders.
she
supports
the
impeachment
hoax
witch
hunt
like
nobody.
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
it.
she
wasn't
too
happy
with
me
last
year.
we
came
"in,"
"andy,"
and
we
did
a
job
on
"her,"
and
this
is
going
to
be
easy.
she
was
caught
telling
"donors,"
"democrats,"
that
she
is
further
left
than
anyone
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
is
that
what
you
want?
it's
not
what
you
want.
so
next
"november,"
the
state
needs
to
defend
its
values
and
vote
for
a
rock-ribbed
kentucky
"conservative,"
mitch
mcconnell.
but
we're
going
to
get
back
to
that
later.
we'll
be
back
many
times.
we'll
be
back
here
many
times.
mitch.
where
is
he?
so
president
obama
left
"mitch,"
and
"me,"
and
"rand,"
and
all
of
"us,"
he
left
142
openings
for
judges.
you're
not
supposed
to
allow
any.
you
don't
do
that.
you
"know,"
they
say
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
do
is
federal
"judges,"
right?
including
the
supreme
"court,"
obviously.
i
came
in
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
many
do
we
"have?\""
they
"said,"
"\"how"
many
"what,"
"sir?\""
i
"said,"
"\"judge"
"openings.\""
and
i
thought
they'd
say
"none,"
or
one
or
two.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
"142.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what?\""
i
"said,"
"\"tell"
me
"again.\""
he
"said,"
"\"we"
have
"142.\""
so
mitch
and
i
and
rand
would
like
to
thank
very
much
president
"obama,"
because
nobody
ever
been
so
generous
in
their
life.
also
with
us
tonight
is
a
great
warrior
and
a
great
"guy,"
"smart,"
"strong,"
loves
your
"state,"
and
he's
really
become
a
good
friend
of
mine.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
he's
a
little
bit
different.
it's
okay.
but
whenever
i've
needed
"him,"
whenever
i
needed
"him,"
he
was
always
there.
it's
true.
i
"mean,"
sometimes
like
i'd
"say,"
"\""
i
don't
need
you
to
"vote,"
"rand.\""
"\"good.\""
and
he'll
vote
his
own
way.
he's
got
that
little
libertarian
touch.
that's
okay.
that's
okay.
but
whenever
we
"need,"
and
i'm
not
talking
about
"me,"
i'm
talking
about
"we,"
we
need
a
"vote,"
he's
so
incredible
and
he's
become
a
really
good
friend.
i
want
to
have
him
come
up
for
a
second.
rand
"paul,"
your
"senator,"
a
great
warrior.
"wow,"
that
was
excellent.
whoa.
"wow,"
thank
you.
thank
you
very
"much,"
rand.
great
job.
he's
a
warrior.
he's
a
"warrior,"
i've
always
said
it.
also
with
us
tonight
are
representatives
from
your
state
that
are
"fantastic,"
a
couple
from
outside
your
"state,"
but
we'll
welcome
them
"also,"
right?
but
these
are
also
great
"fighters,"
great
warriors.
hal
rogers.
thank
"you,"
hal.
brett
guthrie.
thank
"you,"
brett.
thomas
massey.
man
we
just
spoke
about
won
a
great
"grace,"
andy
barr.
james
comer.
"james,"
great.
and
from
an
incredible
state
that
we
won
2016
that
crooked
hillary
said
she's
going
to
win
that
"state,"
didn't
come
too
close
at
winning
that
state.
it's
a
great
"state,"
and
we
love
the
people
of
north
carolina.
congressman
mark
meadows.
along
with
some
of
your
local
great
"politicians,"
and
a
person
that's
done
a
really
spectacular
job.
you
"know,"
in
"michigan,"
a
"woman,"
she
just
kept
"going,"
she
just
kept
going.
reminded
"me,"
by
the
"way,"
of
your
"governor,"
from
the
standpoint
she
never
quit.
"now,"
republicans
hadn't
won
michigan
in
"many,"
many
years.
she
"called,"
"\"could"
you
come
again?
could
you
do
it
again?
could
you
come
make
another
"speech,"
"please?\""
i
"said,"
"\"all"
"right,"
this
is
the
last
"one.\""
"\"no,"
"no,"
no.
how
about
a
couple
of
"more?\""
and
then
bill
clinton
actually
told
hillary
"clinton,"
"\"you"
better
get
"going,"
something's
going
on
in
michigan.
you're
going
to
lose
michigan.
you
better
start
"going.\""
"\"no,"
"no,"
no.
the
polls
say
everything's
"good.\""
and
we
won
the
great
state
of
michigan
for
the
first
time
in
many
years.
and
i
"said,"
when
it
came
time
to
picking
the
republican
party
"chair,"
head
of
the
"rnc,"
i
"said,"
i
got
to
get
the
woman
from
"michigan,"
ronna
"mcdaniel,"
to
head
it
up.
and
when
they
were
saying
how
sophisticated
hillary
clinton's
campaign
was
…
you
"know,"
we're
not
"sophisticated,"
right?
i
don't
think
so.
remember
all
during
the
…
"\"well,"
she's
got
the
finest
computer
technology
in
the
"world.\""
"yeah,"
she
paid
for
"it,"
but
she
didn't
get
it.
"\"she"
has
really
fantastic
"geniuses.\""
but
i
had
somebody
that
was
a
lot
better
than
the
people
that
she
had.
his
name
was
brad
"parscale,"
and
he's
here
with
us.
campaign
manager.
doing
a
great
job.
and
our
numbers
are
looking
very
good.
but
think
of
"it,"
we're
one
day
short
of
a
year
now.
can
you
believe
it?
less
than
a
year.
it
begins
november
3rd
this
time.
we
had
that
"great,"
great
"date,"
oh
"boy,"
november
8th
remember?
was
there
ever
a
day
like
that
in
television
history?
and
they
have
no
"idea,"
because
when
we
do
hang
it
"up,"
they're
all
out
of
business.
they
know
that.
that's
why
i
think
that
we
will
get
…
i
expect
to
get
a
"full,"
"hearty,"
unbelievable
endorsement
very
soon
from
the
failing
new
york
"times,"
and
from
the
amazon
washington
post.
you
"know,"
before
the
election
"started,"
about
a
month
before
i
announced
that
i
was
going
to
do
"this,"
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
become
a
politician.
i
can't
believe
it.
i'm
going
to
become
a
"politician.\""
but
i
looked
at
the
new
york
"times,"
and
it
was
like
a
little
leaflet
that
you
hand
out
at
a
grocery
"store,"
right?
the
wind
would
blow
it
away.
it
was
dead.
i
call
it
the
failing
new
york
times
only
because
eventually
it
will
fail.
but
we
built
it
up.
they
do
stories
…
in
my
entire
"life,"
i
had
a
few
stories
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
"times,"
and
now
if
i
have
three
or
four
a
"day,"
it's
"like,"
"\"why"
are
they
not
covering
me
"anymore?\""
and
they're
all
bad.
they
can
take
what
we
did
two
weeks
ago
with
the
number
one
terrorist
in
the
"world,"
and
they
make
it
look
as
bad
as
possible.
in
"fact,"
i
love
"dogs,"
but
they
gave
the
dog
full
credit.
they
didn't
give
me
any
credit.
that's
okay.
the
dog
got
the
"credit,"
and
the
dog
will
be
coming
very
"shortly,"
by
the
"way,"
to
the
white
house.
but
they'll
be
endorsing
us.
and
you
"know,"
all
of
these
"crazy,"
like
cnn
with
its
bad
"ratings,"
there
goes
its
red
"light,"
it
just
went
off.
their
red
light
just
went
off.
see
how
it
is?
"well,"
it's
hard.
"look,"
put
yourself
in
their
position.
they
have
it
"on,"
their
"covering,"
and
now
they
know
they're
ready
to
get
"hit,"
so
they
turn
it
off.
i
"mean,"
i
can't
blame
them.
their
red
light
just
went
off.
"no,"
but
put
yourself
in
cnn's
position.
without
us
…
you
"know,"
cable
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
good
"business,"
then
we
came
along.
it's
not
"me,"
it's
we.
they
came
from
the
"valleys,"
they
came
from
"everywhere,"
the
"cities,"
they
came
from
"places,"
they're
still
trying
to
figure
"out,"
"\"where"
the
hell
did
all
those
people
come
"from?\""
it's
true.
a
great
senator
from
"tennessee,"
they
have
early
"voting,"
and
i
was
in
pennsylvania
making
a
"speech,"
and
he
saw
me
because
he
had
a
couple
of
great
congressman
friends
from
"pennsylvania,"
and
he
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
in
tennessee
we
have
very
early
"voting,"
and
i
just
"left,"
and
i've
been
doing
this
for
24
years.
and
i
got
to
be
honest
with
"you,"
i've
never
seen
so
many
people
"vote.\""
and
these
are
"people,"
they
love
our
"country,"
they're
"incredible,"
they
work
"hard,"
but
they
never
liked
what
they
were
voting
"for,"
so
they
really
wouldn't
vote.
sounds
terrible.
but
they
didn't
like
anything
that
they
saw.
they
"say,"
"\"sir,"
i'm
seeing
"people,\""
and
he
said
"this,"
"\"come"
out
from
the
"valleys,"
come
out
from
the
"mountains,"
come
out
from
areas
that
they've
never
come
out.
we
have
lines
that
are
five
blocks
long
at
every
voting
booth
and
"parlor.\""
he
"said,"
"\"i"
can't
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
"country,"
but
if
the
rest
of
the
countries
like
"tennessee,"
you're
going
to
have
the
greatest
victory
in
the
history
of
our
"nation.\""
and
that's
what
happened.
that
was
a
great
statement.
that
was
a
great
statement
from
people
from
a
great
"state,"
also.
tomorrow
you
must
elect

china's
doing
"poorly,"
as
you
"know,"
but
they're
paying
us
"billions,"
and
"billions,"
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
they've
never
given
us
25
cents

they
gave
a

of
that
money
to
our
"farmers,"

got
"targeted,"

no
longer.
they're
back
buying
from
our
farmers.
but
we've
created
6.7
million
new
jobs
since
the
election.
and
if
i
would
have
ever
said
that
during
the
"campaign,"
the
fake
news
back
there
would
have
never
let
me
hear
the
end

of
"that,"
6.7.
and
"today,"
just
"today,"
a
"record,"
158

now
"employed,"
the
highest

nobody
ever
thought
that
was
going

be
happening.
under
the
previous
two
"administrations,"
we
lost
"60,000"
factories.
i
thought
that
was
a
typo.
i
"said,"
"\"how"
the
hell
can
you
lose
"60,000?\""
it
turned
out
to
be
right.
and
you
know
how
i
know?
because
i've
been
saying
it
for
two
"years,"
and
they
never
corrected
me.
it's
"true,"
two
years.
i
get
a
call
sometimes
from
the
people
in
the
"campaign,"
"\"sir!"
"sir,"
we
have
an
"emergency.\""
"\"what's"
the
"emergency?\""
"\"somebody's"
calling
from
the
"media,"
the
fake
news.
did
you
put
a
comma
in
the
wrong
"location,"
sir?
because
they
consider
it
to
be
a
front
page
"story.\""
okay.
under
my
"administration,"
we've
added
nearly
"10,000"
new
factories
and
"many,"
many
more
thousands
of
factories
are
coming
into
our
country.
we
reversed
it.
to
get
relief
to
working
"families,"
we
passed
massive
tax
"cuts,"

to
lift
up

created

i
don't
think
…
"well,"
i
don't
know.
you
know?
he's
not
going
to
do
so
well.
he'll
be
calling
for
a
"meeting,"
and
i
won't
be
able
to
see
him
because
i
don't
like
him
very
much.
but
i
like
this
one
very
"much,"
and
we're
going
to
help
him.
we
slashed
a
record
number
of
job-killing
regulations.
we
ended
the
war
on
american
energy.
we're
now
the
largest
producer

we
ended

"costly,"
one-sided

ask
them
how
they're
doing

with

not
too
good.
i
canceled
the
so
called
clean

repealed
obama's
federal
coal
moratorium.
we're
putting
our
great
miners
back
to
work.
on
"trade,"
we're
starting
to
set
records
every
"week,"
we're
reversing
decades
of
washington
"disloyalty,"
"stupidity,"
and
corruption.
past
administrations
did
nothing
as
china
looted
our
"factories,"
and
stole
up
to
$500
billion
of
american
dollars.
by
the
"way,"
people
can't
even
believe
it.
not
500
million.
that's
a
lot.
if
you
lost
500
"million,"
that's
a
lot.
i
thought
that
was
another
typo.
$500
billion
they
would
take
a
year
from
us.
we
rebuilt
china.
and
i
give
them
a
lot
of
"credit,"
by
the
"way,"
i
give
china.
what
i
don't
give
credit
to
is
obama
and
past
administrations
beyond
"obama,"
i
don't
give
them
credit
because
they
let
it
happen.
they
should
have
never
let
it
happen.
but
now
we're
taking
in
tens
of
"billions,"
and
"billions,"
and
billions
of
dollars.
just
"recently,"
very
"slow,"
slippy
joe
…
biden
that
"is,"
said
of
china's
piracy
and
"plunder,"
"\"they're"
not
that
"bad,"
"folks.\""
he
always
used
the
word
folks.
i
watched
him
"today,"
he
used
the
word
folks.
"\"hi"
folks.
hi.
"hi,"
my
time
is
up.
i
got
to
"leave.\""
"no,"
they
have
him
all
freaked
out
because
he
makes
a
mistake
every
time
he
speaks.
so
i
can
just
see
these
"handlers,"
because
they're
"handlers,"
like
they
use
on
"horses,"
they're
"handlers,"
right?
"\"all"
"right,"
get
him
off
now.
he's
been
up
there
long
"enough.\""

they're
"screaming,"

off!

you're

then
he
"goes,"
"\"i"
love
being
in

he
was
in
iowa
yesterday.
yes

they
"say,"
"\"dammit,"

should
have
left
"sooner,"
we
told
him.

off
the

sleepy
"joe,"
get
off

he
said
"about,"

about

"\"they're"

they're
not

500

right?
he
did
nothing
in
eight
"years,"
him
and
obama.
in
"fact,"
i'm
here
because
of

when
you
think
about

right?
just
thinking.
i'm
here
because
of
them.

stand
up.

i
just
saw

i
said

think
of

as

saying

now
"look,"
$1.5

that
"hunter,"
who
got
thrown
out
of
the
"navy,"
who
had
no

who
had
not
"anything,"

a
lot
of
money
from

but
he
got
1.5

i
got
to
tell
"you,"
i've
been
negotiating
with

they're
very
tough.
china.
i
got
to
tell
"you,"
i've
been
negotiating
with
china.
they're
very
tough.
that
is
not
the
same
group
of
chinese
people
that
i've
been
negotiating
with.
they
gave
him
1.5
billion.
he'll
make
millions
and
millions
with
that.
and
how
about
"saying,"
by
the
"way,"
mr.
"president,"
would
you
please
take
over
the
negotiations
that
president
trump
is
no
longer
handling?
guess
what?
you
would
be
sold
down
the
tubes
so
"fast,"
and
we're
so
close.
china
wants
to
make
a
deal
so
badly.
i
think
they'd
love
to
see
another
president.
they
would
like
to
see
another
president
more
than
crooked
hillary
"would,"
okay.
can
you
imagine
if
they
ever
took
over
negotiations
of
this
"deal,"
which
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
deals
ever
made.
has
to
"be,"
because
we
started
down
here
and
they
were
up
there.
has
to
be.
can
you
imagine
if
they
ever
took
over
negotiations?
this
is
what
china
would
love
more
than
anything
else.
it's
not
going
to
happen
"folks,"
because
we
can't
let
our
country
go
back
to
hell.
we
can't
do
it.
we
can't
let
it
happen.
because
the
bidens
got
rich
while
america
was
"robbed,"
and
let
me
tell
you
the
fake
news
will
not
put
it
in.
i
watched
the
last
"debate,"
and
this
weakling
named
anderson
cooper
"saying,"
"well,"
it's
totally
"unsubstantiated,"
mr.
"biden,"
solely
answer.
what's
unsubstantiated?
he
is
on
tape
doing
a
real
quid
pro
quo.
"sure,"
it's
totally
"unsubstantiated,"
sir.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
could
you
imagine
if
i
did
what
he
did?
could
you
imagine
if
don
jr.
or
eric
trump
walked
out
of
china
while
i
"was,"
let's
"say,"
vice
president
or
president.
let's
say
they
walked
out
of
china
with
1.5
billion.
do
you
think
the
press
would
be
"saying,"
"well,"
it's
unsubstantiated?
"no,"
it's
something.
let
me
just
tell
you
something.
these
"people,"
not
all
of
"them,"
but
these
people
are
very
dishonest
people.
"very,"
very
dishonest.
but
under
this
"administration,"
the
great
betrayal
is
over.
america
is
not
for
sale.
and
we're
more
determined
than
ever
to
drain
the
"swamp,"
and
that's
what
we're
doing
with
these
crazy
people.
a
lot
of
bad
things
"happened,"
and
a
lot
of
bad
things
i
think
are
going
to
be
revealed
because
there's
no
way
we
can
allow
them
to
get
away
with
what
they
would
have
with
a
normal
person
gotten
away
with.
let's
face
it.
these
are
bad
people.
thanks
to
my
"tariffs,"
we
will
soon
have
over
$100
billion
from
a
country
that
didn't
want
to
do
anything
with
us.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
they
started
buying
our
farm
product.
you
see
that.
they
started
buying
a
lot
of
our
product
even
before
the
deals
are
done.
last
"year,"
i
got
our
farmers
$16
billion
because
they
were
targeted.
and
the
year
before
i
got
them
$12
billion.
i
just
took
them
out
of
the
"tariffs,"
and
we
had
a
lot
leftover.
and
i
"said,"
congratulations
farmers.
i
love
you.
i
love
our
farmers.
they
love
me.
that's
why
they
"did,"
they
targeted
our
farmers.
i
"said,"
congratulations.
that's
compliments
of
china.
and
they
do.
they
want
to
make
a
deal
so
badly.
"frankly,"
"honestly,"
they
want
to
make
a
deal
a
lot
more
than
i
want
to
make
a
deal.
that's
the
way
it
is.
because
we're
doing
very
well
right
now
with
china.
we're
replacing
the
nafta
disaster
with
the
"us,"
"mexico,"
canada
agreement.
a
huge
win
for
kentucky
"farmers,"
for
kentucky
auto
"workers,"
for
kentucky
manufacturers.
"unfortunately,"
nancy
pelosi
so
far
and
the
do
nothing
democrats
don't
want
to
give
the
people
of
our
country
a
victory.
it's
"really,"
let
it
be
a
bipartisan
deal.
i
don't
care.
it's
such
an
incredible
deal
for
this
"country,"
and
nafta
was
one
of
the
worst
deals
ever
made.
democrats
need
to
pass
the
us
mca.
we
need
their
votes.
otherwise
you
can't
pass
it.
and
it's
up
to
pelosi
who
has
to
put
it
"forward,"
but
she's
too
busy
wasting
their
time.
so
either
pass
it
or
go
back
to
san
francisco
and
clean
up
your
mess.
the
obama
biden's
administration's
trans-pacific
partnership
would
have
dealt
the
death
blow
to
the
american
auto
industry.
that
would
have
been
one
of
the
great
catastrophes.
my
first
week
in
"office,"
i
canceled
that
job-killing
travesty.
you
know
all
about
it.
under
our
policies
just
days
"ago,"
ford
and
the
uaw
announced
a
$1
billion
investment
in
louisville.
1
billion.
before
my
"election,"
our
leaders
used
the
great
american
middle-class
as
a
piggy
bank
to
fund
their
delusional
global
projects.
they
were
globalists.
i
was
elected
to
be
president
of
the
united
"states,"
not
president
of
the
globe.
they
decimated
american
manufacturing
to
promote
economic
growth
in
foreign
countries.
tell
"me,"
how
is
that
good.
they
try
and
convince
you
it's
good.
i
was
a
very
good
student.
i'm
a
very
"like,"
we're
all
smart.
we
sit
"back,"
we
"listen,"
and
i
"say,"
these
people
"are,"
something
wrong
with
them.
only
in
kentucky
can
somebody
be
so
precise.
you're
right
"about,"
you
are
right
about
that.
they
deployed
our
military
to
protect
immensely
wealthy
"nations,"
subsidizing
their
welfare
states
with
your
money.
the
money
we
spend
on
other
country's
"militaries,"
but
it's
coming
down.
and
i'm
telling
other
"countries,"
i'm
"sorry,"
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
now.
i'm
sorry.
pay.
pay.
"pay,"
you
got
to
pay.
and
they
poured
precious
american
blood
and
treasure
into
the
middle
east
while
our
great
cities
fell
into
decay
and
disrepair.
we
go
in
for
internet.
we
want
"rural,"
we'll
bring
it
in.
and
we're
bringing
5g
into
places
like
kentucky
that
haven't
been
properly
served.
we're
bringing
it
in
all
over
the
middle
"west,"
all
over
the
country.
and
we're
really
ahead
of
schedule.
we're
doing
really
well.
people
will
be
very
surprised
soon
when
some
numbers
come
"out,"
but
we're
doing
very
well.
but
you
were
very
much
underserved
for
years.
and
yet
we're
investing
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
in
places
you've
never
even
heard
of.
doesn't
make
"sense,"
does
it?
but
after
years
of
rebuilding
other
"nations,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
nation.
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
yet
the
deep
state
and
the
failed
ruling
class
are
trying
to
resist
any
changes
to
their
failed
policies
of
the
past.
they
believe
it
is
their
right
to
rule
over
you
and
to
redistribute
your
wealth
all
around
the
world.
no
thank
you.
no
thank
you.
that's
why
we
ended
the
paris
accord.
that's
why…
we've
ended
a
lot.
i
don't
even
want
to
tell
you.
but
the
sellout
of
the
american
nation
ended
the
day
i
took
the
oath
of
office
and
you
understand
that.
past
leaders
transform
far
away
nations
into
chaotic
war
zones.
then
they
demanded
that
america
accept
unlimited
migration
from
those
terror
afflicted
regions.
take
the
"people,"
take
the
people.
we
defeated
isis.
we.
when
i
took
over
three
years
"ago,"
when
we
took
"over,"
when
i
took
"over,"
isis
was
all
over.
i
defeated
isis.
i
didn't
even
know
to
what
extent.
i
was
watching
the
other
night
the
great
lou
"dobbs,"
and
he
"said,"
"\"when"
trump
took
"over,"
president
"trump,\""
he
used
to
"say,"
"\"trump"
is
a
great
"president.\""
then
he
"said,"
"\"trump"
is
the
greatest
president
since
ronald
"reagan.\""
then
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
trump
is
an
even
better
president
than
ronald
"reagan.\""
and
now
he's
got
me
down
as
the
greatest
president
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
including
george
washington
and
abraham
lincoln.
thank
you.
we
love
you
too.
but
we
didn't
fight
them
over
there
only
to
invite
them
over
here.
we
didn't
do
that.
we're
not
doing
that.
you
see
what
we're
going
and
you
see
what
we're
doing
and
you
see
it's
never
easy
because
i
get
hit
by
the
swamp
15
different
"ways,"
but
it
doesn't
matter.
we're
doing
the
right
thing
to
protect
our
communities.
my
administration
implemented
the
travel
ban
on
some
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
countries.
a
lot
of
people
were
against
it.
they
"said,"
"\"isn't"
that
"terrible?\""
countries
that
have
crime
rates
that
are
so
high
you
wouldn't
even
believe
it's
"possible,"
and
we
have
a
travel
ban
now.
we
don't
take
people
from
those
countries.
i'm
sorry.
and
we
won
a
historic
victory
on
the
travel
ban
in
the
united
states
supreme
"court,"
ruled
it
totally
constitutional.
on
no
issue
have
democrats
more
totally
betrayed
you
than
on
immigration.
democrats
want
open
borders.
they
want
to
give
illegal
aliens
free
"healthcare,"
free
"education,"
more
advantages
than
our
own
citizens
have
and
more
benefits
than
our
own
military
gets.
in
the
republican
"party,"
we
believe
taking
care
of
our
own
citizens
first
is
paramount.
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
our
southern
"border,"
illegal
crossings
have
dropped
60%
since
may.
the
wall
is
being
built.
it's
going
up
rapidly.
it's
got
a
big
impact.
and
i
want
to
thank
mexico.
we
have
"27,000"
mexican
soldiers
on
our
border
policing
our
border
because
the
democrats
will
not
do
anything
to
end
loopholes.
it
would
take
us
15
minutes
and
we
could
end
the
loopholes.
think
of
the
word
loopholes.
they
don't
want
to
end
the
loophole.
if
you
want
to
keep
violent
criminal
aliens
out
of
your
"communities,"
you
have
only
one
choice
"tomorrow,"
and
that's
to
vote
for
matt
bevin.
democrats
are
becoming
more
extreme
and
militant
by
the
day.
the
democrat's
planned
government
takeover
of
healthcare
would
obliterate
medicare.
what
are
they
doing?
i
will
always
protect
medicare
for
our
nation's
seniors.
it's
going
to
be
protected.
what
they're
doing
is
crazy.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
and
we
will
also
protect
you
with
preexisting
physicians.
how
about
that?
preexisting
physicians.
first
time
i've
ever
said
"that,"
just
thought
of
that.
true.
because
under
their
"plan,"
you
don't
get
your
own
doctor.
you
know
what
you
get?
whatever
the
hell
you
get.
that's
what
you
get.
oh
great
"doc,"
fix
me
up
doc.
you
mean
you
want
to
work
on
my
heart?
who
are
"you,"
doc?
i
don't
think
so.
thanks
to
our
campaign
to
combat
the
opioid
epidemic
with
your
governor's
"help,"
we
have
seen
a
17%
drop
in
overdose
deaths
in
"kentucky,"
which
is
a
record.
democrats
have
also
waged
an
unrelenting
assault
against
people
of
faith.
anybody
in
here
a
person
of
faith?
great
people.
the
last
administration
threatened
adoption
and
foster
care
agencies
purely
for
their
religious
beliefs.
last
week
my
administration
took
action
to
stop
that
obama
era
assault.
it
was
an
assault.
and
governor
matt
bevin
is
a
national
leader
on
behalf
of
vulnerable
"children,"
and
there
is
no
better
leader
than
"him,"
what
he
has
done.
and
together
we're
fighting
for
american
"orphans,"
foster
"families,"
and
the
sacred
rights
of
religious
believers.
and
he's
done
a
fantastic
job.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
their
mother's
womb
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
and
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god.
democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
and
blatant
corruption.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
it's
the
party
of
the
great
abraham
lincoln.
we
forgot
that.
abraham
lincoln.
the
incredible
rebuilding
of
our
military
includes
over
$100
billion
investments
all
across
the
state
of
kentucky.
i
withdrew
our
nation
from
the
horrible
one
sided
iran
nuclear
deal.
it's
not
the
same
country.
when
i
came
in
that
"country,"
there
were
in
18
different
sites
of
"confliction,"
they
called
it.
and
now
they're
a
little
"different,"
a
little
different.
we'll
see
what
happens
with
iran.
and
i
recognize
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
for
"years,"
you
watched
as
your
politicians
apologized
for
america.
remember?
he'd
go
"around,"
"oh,"
thank
you
so
much.
he
wouldn't
apologize
to
"you,"
but
he
apologized
to
others.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
"america,"
and
we
are
standing
up
for
the
people
of
kentucky.
the
next
step
to
victory
begins
tomorrow
and
it
begins
with
all
of
you.
you
have
to
do
this.
"look,"
maybe
you'll
be
late
for
work.
maybe
you'll
be
late
for
whatever.
i
don't
want
to
know
everything.
some
things
i
don't
want
to
"know,"
but
you
have
to
just
put
it
off.
you
have
to
go
vote.
it's
so
important.
tomorrow
is
"so,"
because
beyond
even
the
"governorship,"
and
it's
so
important.
because
"again,"
your
state
is
setting
records.
in
the
history
of
your
"state,"
you've
never
done
this
well
"economically,"
job
"wise,"
"unemployment,"
"employment,"
factories
moving
"in,"
new
"factories,"
open
expansion
of
your
car
plants.
you've
never
done
this
"well,"
but
you're
sending
that
big
message
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
it's
so
important.
you
got
to
get
your
"friends,"
you
got
to
vote.
because
if
you
"lose,"
it
sends
a
really
bad
message.
it
just
sends
a
"bad,"
and
they
will
build
it
up.
here's
the
story.
if
you
"win,"
they're
going
to
make
it
like
ho
hum.
and
if
you
"lose,"
they're
going
to
"say,"
trump
suffered
the
greatest
defeat
in
the
history
of
the
world.
this
was
the
greatest.
you
can't
let
that
happen
to
me.
and
you
know
what?
you
can't
let
that
happen
to
your
incredible
"state,"
kentucky.
you
can't
let
that
happen.
that
would
be
a
disaster
for
yourself
because
you'd
be
losing
an
incredible
governor.
but
you're
going
to
have
a
great
victory
tomorrow.
with
your
"support,"
you
have
to
go
out
and
vote.
we
will
show
the
corrupt
democrats
that
the
american
people
are
not
backing
down
and
we
will
never
ever
back
down.
so
"tomorrow,"
we
need
you
to
go
out
and
get
your
"friends,"
get
your
"family,"
get
your
neighbors.
get
out
and
vote
for
governor
matt
bevin
and
all
of
these
great
republicans.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
lift
millions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
independence
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress.
"2020,"
we're
going
to
re-elect
because
of
their
stupidity.
these
people
are
on
the
"run,"
and
i
will
campaign
in
every
one
of
those
states
that
were
so
corrupt
if
they
raise
their
hand.
and
don't
forget.
out
of
"194,"
we
got
"194,"
not
one
republican
left
us
last
week.
and
two
"republicans,"
think
of
that.
and
the
other
three
couldn't
get
there
because
"of,"
but
they
were
votes.
they
said
they
were
totally
"votes,"
had
airport
problems.
i
"said,"
you
can't
do
that.
airport
problems.
but
then
we
had
the
democrats.
we
picked
up
two
"democrats,"
so
we
had
bipartisan
support.
that's
unusual.
i
always
say
because
they're
lousy
"politicians,"
they've
got
lousy
"policy,"
but
they
do
stick
together.
that's
about
it.
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
in
2020.
and
we'll
have
a
great
speaker
of
the
house
in
kevin.
we're
going
to
create
a
"fair,"
"safe,"
"sane,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we'll
enact
trade
deals
that
result
in
more
products
proudly
stamped
with
those
beautiful
words
"\"made"
in
the
"usa\"."
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
"medicine,"
finding
new
cures
for
childhood
cancer
and
"ending,"
listen
to
"this,"
the
aids
epidemic
in
america
within
less
than
10
years.
we've
already
started.
who
would
have
felt
we
could
have
done
that?
we've
started.
in
the
past
administration
toward
the
"end,"
we
had
certain
things
that
we
could
have
done.
they
didn't
do
anything.
they
didn't
do
"anything,"
but
we
did.
we
have
it
all
funded
and
we
"started,"
think
of
"that,"
aids
within
10
years
will
be
out
of
this
country.
nobody
would
have
thought
that
was
possible.
we
will
end
it.
"great,"
great.
i
came
into
my
"office,"
they
were
telling
me
about
the
breakthroughs
that
have
been
made.
it's
incredible
what
they're
doing.
and
don't
forget
right
to
"try,"
by
the
"way,"
where
somebody
who's
terminally
ill
can
now
use
our
"medicines,"
which
they
were
never
allowed
to
in
the
past.
so
instead
of
traveling
to
asia
and
europe
and
all
over
the
"world,"
or
going
home
hopeless
and
"dying,"
they
can
now
use
what
we
call
right
to
try.
we
have
the
greatest
"doctors,"
the
greatest
"drugs,"
greatest
labs
in
the
world.
they
can
now
go
and
try.
and
we
are
having
unbelievable
success.
unbelievable.
right
to
try.
we
will
chart
a
new
era
of
discovery
in
"space,"
and
someday
soon
we
will
land
"on,"
believe
it
or
"not,"
the
surface
of
the
moon
only
to
go
to
mars.
you
know
i
said
we've
done
the
moon.
"no,"
they
"say,"
"sir,"
we
land
on
the
moon
to
go
to
"mars,"
and
that's
what
we're
doing
with
the
moon.
and
we
are
"really,"
really
advanced.
it's
moving
along
rapidly.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
free
"assembly,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
and
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
cherished
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
the
incredible
heroes
and
warriors
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
loyal
citizens
like
you
helped
build
this
"country,"
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american
people.
the
great
state
of
kentucky
was
settled
by
some
of
the
most
devoted
and
courageous
people
ever
to
walk
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
these
tough
pioneer
men
and
strong
pioneer
women
braved
the
wilderness
and
defied
the
danger
to
build
a
life
and
to
build
a
home.
they
didn't
have
a
lot
of
money.
they
didn't
have
a
lot
of
luxury.
but
they
all
had
one
thing
in
common.
they
love
their
"families,"
they
love
their
country
and
they
love
their
god.
these
proud
kentucky
patriots
did
not
shed
their
"blood,"
sweat
and
tears
so
that
we
could
sit
at
home
while
others
try
to
erase
their
legacy
and
destroy
their
magnificent
heritage.
our
allegiance
is
to
our
nation.
our
loyalty
is
to
our
citizens.
and
our
devotion
is
to
our
creator.
for
the
sake
of
our
"freedom,"
for
the
sake
of
our
"children,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"fighting,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
we
are
one
movement.
we
are
one
people.
we
are
one
family
and
one
glorious
nation
under
god.
america
is
thriving
like
never
before.
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
"kentucky,"
the
best
is
yet
to
come.
"together,"
we
will
make
america
wealthy
again.
we
will
make
america
strong
again.
we
will
make
america
proud
again.
we
will
make
america
safe
again.
and
we
will
make
america
great
again.
thank
"you,"
kentucky.
thank
you.
go
out
and

"[hello,"
everybody.
"hello,"
everybody.
wow.
"hello,"
everybody.
thank
you.
thank
you.
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
we're
landing
and
there
are
thousands
of
people
along
the
"runways,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"why"
aren't
they
"here?\""
"\"sir,"
we
couldn't
let
them
"in.\""
"\"why"
not?
let's
let
them
"in.\""
"oh,"
these
people.
and
then
they
put
in
a
floor.
this
is
for
manchester
because
you
know
about
flooring.
they
put
in
a
floor
that's
like
an
ice
skating
rink.
so
we're
going
to
tiptoe
around.
how
are
"you,"
everybody?
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
"great,"
great
people.
"manchester,"
we
had
some
good
memories
in
manchester.
"2016,"
but
this
is
going
to
"be,"
we
are
right
now
in
the
most
important
election
in
our
history.
but
i'm
thrilled
to
be
back
in
the
granite
state
with
the
true
hard-working
american
patriots.
last
night
it
was
my
great
honor
to
accept
the
republican
nomination
for
president
of
the
united
states.
we're
going
to
win.
we're
going
to
win.
does
anybody
have
any
doubt?
does
anybody…
it's
very
"interesting,"
last
night
we
had
an
incredible
time
and
i
don't
know
if
you
"know,"
it's
driving
the
fake
news
crazy.
they're
back.
but
the
poll
numbers
have
swung.
if
you
go
back
six
months
before
the
plague
flew
in
from
"china,"
the
"plague,"
the
horrible
"plague,"
this
election
was
over.
this
election
was
over.
and
then
i
had
to
go
back
to
work.
i
had
to
go
back
to
work.
and
then
i
went
back
to
work
and
we've
done
an
incredible
job
in
every
aspect
of
running
"government,"
but
i
also
had
to
start
campaigning
a
little
bit
"again,"
and
i
did.
and
today
it
was
announced
that
joe
biden
is
coming
out
of
the
basement.
because
the
poll
numbers
have
totally
swung.
they
totally
swung.
and
they've
swung
like
nobody's
ever
seen
them
swing
before.
and
it
was
rapid.
it
was
a
rapid
swing.
because
they
all
admit
that
we're
doing
a
great
job.
there's
not
too
many
presidents
that
have
done
a
job
like
we've
"done,"
including
keeping
you
out
of
"wars,"
bringing
you
home
from
the
endless
wars.
but
they've
swung.
but
here's
what
i
don't
get.
sleepy
joe's
coming
out
he
said
in
10
"days,"
that's
a
long…
10
days.
10
days.
that's
like
an
eternity
in
trumpville.
10
days.
i
view
10
days
is
like
an
"eternity,"
okay?
so
he
decided
he's
coming
out
and
he's
going
to
be
out
in
10
days.
that's
a
long
time.
that's
a
big
percentage
of
the
remaining
time.
that's
all
"right,"
he's
much
better
off
where
he
is.
i
think
"he's,"
i
think
he
just…
and
how
about
those
stories
from
friends
of
mine?
how
about
those
stories?
was
that
just
compelling
and
incredible
"television,"
but
really
that
was
an
"exciting,"
a
really
good
quality
convention.
really
great.
so
many
people.
so
many
"people,"
you
saw
some
tragic
"situations,"
some
really
great
"endorsements,"
you
saw
everything.
if
you…
how
about
the
endorsement
of
herschel
walker?
when
you
watch
that
that
was
from
the
heart.
that
was
from
the
heart.
dana
white
today.
i
just
saw
it
today
because
last
night
i
was
looking
at
this
speech
a
little
bit.
we
had
a
wonderful
turnout
last
night.
what
i
didn't
"like,"
you
saw
this
"right,"
when
it
was
"over,"
you
saw
when
it
was
over?
the
thugs
outside
because
the
democratic
mayor
of
washington
"dc,"
it's
another
democrat
that's
not
believing
in
law
and
order.
and
you
know
we
give
washington
dc
a
lot
of
money
to
run
"it,"
but
they
don't
do
a
good
job
of
running
it.
the
"mayor,"
she
doesn't
run
anything.
and
these
incredible
people
from
all
over
the
"country,"
all
over
the
world
that
were
there
last
"night,"
they
walked
out
to
a
bunch
of
thugs.
and
that
"wasn't,"
remember
"this,"
that
wasn't
friendly
protesters.
they
were
thugs.
they
were
thugs.
and
the
dc
police
are
"good,"
but
the
mayor
gave
bad
instructions
last
"night,"
that
should
have
never
been
allowed
to
happen.
when
a
senator
like
rand
paul
walks
"out,"
and
thank
god
we
had
some
good
police
around
him
and
they
took
a
tremendous…
they
took
tremendous
abuse.
and
rand
paul
was
in
big
trouble
last
"night,"
he's
a
good
"guy,"
he's
a
friend
of
"mine,"
and
that
shouldn't
happen
to
anybody.
but
he
is
a
us
senator
walking
outside
and
those
four
policemen
should
be
brought
over
to
the
white
house
and
we
ought
to
give
them
a
medal
of
some
"kind,"
and
we're
going
to
do
it.
we're
going
to
do
it.
i
told
that
to
rand.
and
the
mayor
should
be
ashamed
of
herself
for
that
kind
of
a
display
of
incompetence
because
that's
what's
happening
in
portland.
and
that's
what's
happening
all
over
where
you
have
democrat-run
cities.
just
take
a
look.
and
we're
looking
at
the
whole
situation
in
"dc,"
and
tonight
they
have
a
lot
of
people
"gathering,"
let's
see
how
that
works
out.
they
have
to
be
able
to
manage
their
"affairs,"
they
get
a
lot
of
money.
she's
always
looking
for
"money,"
"\"could"
we
have
more
"money?\""
"\"what"
are
you
going
to
waste
it
on?
i
mean
spend
it
on.
what
are
you
going
to
waste
it
"on,"
"mayor?\""
and
then
our
people
walk
"out,"
and
these
are
people
from
all
over
the
"world,"
they
"walk,"
including
"congress,"
by
the
"way,"
they
walk
out
and
they
get
"accosted,"
they
get
"abused,"
they
get
spit
on.
it's
a
disgrace.
and
our
country
is
going
to
change.
we're
not
going
to
allow
that
to
happen.
you
"know,"
we're
not
supposed
to
be…
we're
not
supposed
to
be
involved
unless
we're
invited
in
by
the
people
that
"run,"
these
are
all
democrat
"cities,"
just
so
you
"understand,"
including
dc.
so
we're
not
supposed
to
go
in
unless
we
call
it
an
"insurrection,"
but
that's
a
big
statement.
it's
a
big
statement.
no
reason
for
it.
but
you
know
what
we're
going
to
do?
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
it.
mark
meadows
is
"here,"
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
it
because
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen
to
people
that
go
to
the
white
house
to
celebrate
our
country.
and
a
weak
guy
named
joe
"biden,"
and
he's
"weak,"
he's
weak
as
"hell,"
a
weak
guy
like
joe
biden
didn't
even
bring
law
and
order
up
as
a
subject
for
discussion
in
the
entire
democrat
national
convention.
now
they're
all
of
a
sudden…
now
they
realize
because
they've
gone
down
like
a
rock
in
"water,"
they've
gone
down
in
the
polls
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
they're
talking
"all,"
"\"well,"
we
have
to
talk
about
"crime.\""
number
"one,"
they
have
no…
look
at
what
happened
to
new
"york,"
look
at
what's
going
on
in
"chicago,"
all
"democrats,"
all
radical
left
democrats.
look
at
what's
going
on
in
the
great
state
of
wisconsin.
now
i
will
tell
"you,"
two
days
ago
we
sent
in
the
national
guard.
that
was
the
end
of
that
problem.
look
at
portland.
we
want
to
send
in
the
national
"guard,"
we
sent
in
homeland
security
just
to
protect
our…
couple
of
our
"buildings,"
including
a
"courthouse,"
can
you
believe
it?
we
sent
in
because-
…
couple
of
our
"buildings,"
including
a
courthouse.
can
you
believe
it?
we
send
in
because
they
can't
protect
it.
so
we
"sent,"
they
did
a
very
effective
job.
we
could
take
care
of
portland
in
45
"minutes,"
45
minutes.
if
that
"governor,"
if
that
mayor
would
call
and
"say,"
"\"please"
send
in
the
national
"guard.\""
just
like
…
"hey,"
we
did
it
in
minneapolis.
remember
that?
the
place
was
going
to
burn
down.
another
few
"days,"
we
send
in
the
national
"guard,"
it
was
over
within
an
hour.
they
ought
to
get
smart
and
that's
what
they
ought
to
do.
so
now
they're
talking
"about,"
"\"well,"
we
want
to
"…\""
why
did
they
call
it
a
friendly
protest?
right?
remember
the
idiot
from
"cnn,"
he's
standing
there.
this
is
a
friendly
protest.
behind
him
over
his
"shoulders,"
the
entire
city
is
burning
down.
sixty
seven
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
the
great
state
of
new
hampshire.
we
have
to.
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
within
my
first
term
in
"office,"
we've
secured
america's
"borders,"
brought
back
our
manufacturing
"jobs,"
rebuilt
the
united
states

it
was
a
mess.
it
was
a
depleted
mess.

out

you
see
the
price
of
your
gasoline.
when
you
go
fill
it
"up,"
"\"oh"
"boy,"
that's
a
nice
"price.\""
it's
half
what
it
was.
we
built
the
single
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
that
includes
"china,"
which
was
having
a
"very,"
very
bad
year.
then
the
plague
came
in
from
china.
we
had
to
close
it
up.
we
saved
millions
of
lives
and
now
we're
open
again
and
we're
setting
records.
we're
setting
records.
wait
till
you
see
the
numbers
just
before
the
election.
there'll
be
released
and
this
is
despite
the
fact
that
the
democrats
are
holding

take
a
look.

want
to
keep
them.
by
the
"way,"
on
november
"4th,"
"regardless,"
they'll
be
opening
them
"up,"
november
"4th,"
because
they
think
that
hurts
the
economy
and
that
will
hurt
"me,"
but
our
numbers
are
going
to
be
great.
we're
going
to
have
a
great
third
quarter.
we're
going
to
have
an
unbelievable
next
"year,"
unless
somebody
stupid
gets
elected
and
raises
your
taxes.
this
"november,"
each
of
you
will
vote
in
truly
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
used
to
say
it
about
2016.
this
is
now
at
a
new
level.
joe
biden
is
the
puppet
of
the
radical
left
movement
that
seeks
to
obliterate
and
destroy
everything
that
you
hold
here
including
your
second
"amendment,"
which
will
have
no
chance.
your
vote
will
decide
whether
we
save
the
american
dream
or
whether
we
allow
biden
to
eliminate
your
jobs.
by
the
"way,"
it's

to
erase

"borders,"
confiscate
your
"guns,"
appoint

left
judges
and
"prosecutors,"
tear
down
our
history.
demolish
your
suburbs.
you
saw
what
i
did.
i
ended
the
rule.
you're
not
going
to
have
low
income
housing
built
in
your
suburbs
"anymore,"
but
nobody
writes
that
because
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to
write
"that,"
but
everyone
knows.
unless
our
friends
in
the
suburbs
have
gotten
a
lot
dumber
than
they
used
to
"be,"
they
know
that.
they
want
to
destroy
your
"suburbs,"
indoctrinate
our
"children,"
defund
the
police
and
try
everything
in
the
book
to
turn
our
cities
so
that
they
look
more
like
"portland,"
oregon
than
what
we're
used
to
looking
at.
never
"forget,"
they
are
coming
after
me
because
i
am
fighting
for
you.
it's
true.

is
filled
with

at

floyd.
they
have
no
idea.
if
you
ask
"them,"
"\"who's"
george
"floyd?\""
they
couldn't
even
tell
you.
these
are
just
bad
"people,"
troublemakers
and
they
shouldn't
be
representing
our
country
at
important
events
and
we've
got
to
stop
it.
democrats
have
no
complaint
about
the
rioters
and
the
"vandals,"
marauding
through
our
cities
or
mass
unruly
"demonstrations,"
but
they
don't
believe
law
abiding
citizens
can
go
to
a
church
together.
you
can't
go
to
church
anymore.
you
know
how
many
churches
are
closed
in
this
country
because
of
the
democrats?
you
can
go
out
and
you
can
have
thousands
of
people
marauding
through
the
"streets,"
threatening
other
"people,"
beyond
"threatening,"
kicking
them
in
the
"face,"
doing
what
they've
done.
you've
seen
it.
they
would
have
done
that
to
senator
rand
paul
last
night.
he'd
either
be
in
very
bad
shape
or
dead
and
that
would
include
his
wife
if
those
policemen
didn't
happen
to
be
there.
they
took
some
big
beating.
the
reason
they
didn't
fight
back
too
"much,"
they
don't
want
to
lose
their
pension.
they
don't
want
to
lose
their
"job,"
because
we've
become
so
politically
"correct,"
everybody's
afraid
to
do
anything
"now,"
but
they
did
a
good
job.
the
puppet
"biden,"
who's
just
controlled
so
strongly
wants
you
to
cancel
"weddings,"
funerals
and
"school,"
but
has
no
problem
with
thousands
of
so-called
peaceful
protesters
cramming
into
your
"streets,"
mugging
"people,"
hurting
"people,"
robbing
"stores,"
looting
"stores,"
burning
down
storefronts.
the
radical
left
will
do
anything
to
get
power.
they
smear
"justice,"
brett
"kavanaugh,"
and
they
are
…
did
you
see
anything
like
that?
justice
kavanaugh.
people
forget.
time
goes
"by,"
they
forget.
we
don't
forget.
i
don't
forget.
they're
destroying
the
livelihoods
of
innocent
people
and
if
biden
"wins,"
which
i
honestly
can't
believe
can
happen.
i
will
have
lost
to
a
low
iq
individual.
i
don't
want
that.
i
don't
want
it.
sleepy
"joe,"
i
don't
want
it.
but
the
agitators
will
go
from
rioting
in
the
streets
to
running
the
halls
of
government.
can
you
believe
it?
the
"levers,"
they
call
it
the
levers
of
government.
the
top
10
most
dangerous
cities
in
america
are
run
by
democrats
and
have
been
for
decades.
now
they're
trying
to
impose
those
policies
across
the
entire
country.
no
one
will
be
safe
in
biden's
america.
i
can't
even
call
it
biden's
america.
god
doesn't
know
he's
alive.
he's
going
to
be
out
in
10
days.
he's
going
to
start
10
days.
ten
days.
i
"mean,"
i
gave
a
big
speech
last
night.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
am
i
doing
tomorrow
"night?\""
you're
going
to
new
"hampshire,"
but
"sir,"
we
can
cancel
new
hampshire
because
you
had
a
big
night.
we
can
cancel.
are
you
crazy?
i
don't
have
the
courage
to
cancel
new
hampshire.
i
got
to
win
new
hampshire.
i
love
the
people
and
you've
been
very
good
to
me.
you've
been
very
good
to
me.
you've
been
very
good
to
me.
"so,"
new
hampshire
was
the
first
state
i
won.
right?
"remember,"
i
came
here.
i
was
very
excited.
that
was
an
exciting
evening.
that
was
an
exciting
"race,"
but
we
don't
talk
about
that
anymore.
we
have
to
talk
about
the
future.
we
don't
talk
about
it.
that
was
great.
it
was
important.
we've
done
more
than
any
administration
in
its
first
three
and
a
half
years
in
the
history
of
our
country.
that's
despite
phony
witch
"hunts,"
phony
"investigations,"
a
phony
impeachment
based
on
a
phone
call
that
was
absolutely
perfect.
that's
despite
a
pandemic
that
was
probably
sent
in
by
"china,"
who
the
hell
knows
how
it
got
here
and
all
over
the
"world,"
because
china
does
not
want
to
see
me
win
i
can
tell
you
that.
we're
not
happy
with
china.
i'll
tell
you
why.
if
biden
got
"in,"
china
would
own
the
united
states
very
quickly.
they'd
own
it.
if
the
democrat
party
wants
to
stand
with
"anarchist,"
"criminals,"
"rioters,"
"looters,"
and
flag
"burners,"
that's
up
to
them.
the
republican
party
and
"you,"
i
can
see
you.
is
there
anybody
in
this
place
that
enjoys
burning
the
american
flag?
is
there
anybody?
please
quietly
raise
your
hand.
be
careful.
could
be
very
dangerous.
the
republican
party
will
remain
the
voice
of
the
patriotic
heroes
who
keep
america
safe
and
our
law
enforcement.
right?
we
are
all
that
stand
between
the
american
people
and
the
left
wing
mob.
if
you
want
to
save
democracy
from
the
"mob,"
then
you
must
vote
to
defeat
an
extremely
poor
candidate.
"look,"
i
believe
i
have
the
honor
of
running
against
the
worst
candidate
ever
put
up
by
the
democratic
"party,"
the
worst.
how
do
you
get
worse?
i
believe
he's
the
worst
"candidate,"
the
slowest
candidate.
i
"mean,"
in
prime
"time,"
he
was
the
slowest
"candidate,"
which
was
a
long
time
ago.
primetime.
you
know
what
i
don't
like
"though,"
they
say
he's
like
"78,"
"79,"
"78,"
i
guess.
right?
i
know
people
that
are
"85,"
that
are
"88,"
"92,"
bernie
"marcus,"
home
"depot,"
he's
92
years
old.
he's
the
sharpest
guy
you'll
ever
meet.
there's
nothing
…
78
is
"okay,"
but
that's
a
bad
"78,"
not
a
good
78.
78
is
"okay,"
but
he
shouldn't
say
that.
they
shouldn't
say
…
the
"press,"
they
say
he's
too
old.
he's
not
too
old.
he's
not
too
"old,"
but
78
is
"okay,"
but
i
do.
i
know
people
in
their
90s
that
are
100%
sharp
and
good
"physically,"
actually
good
physically.
you
want
debate?
so
do
i.
i
want
debates
too.
i
want
debates
too.
"tonight,"
we're
honored
to
be
joined
by
new
hampshire
house
republican
"leader,"
dick
hinch.
where
is
dick?
i
think
your
great
governor
is
here.
where's
the
governor?
where's
our
governor?
"hi,"
dick.
good
job.
do
we
like
dick?
yes.
where's
our
governor?
he's
here.
he
just
met
me.
i
told
"him,"
"\"go"
"back.\""
"hi,"
steve.
because
you
have
a
great
governor
and
we
don't
have
same
day
voting
anymore.
we
don't
have
same
day.
what
a
joke
that
was
last
"time,"
remember?
buses
poured
up
from
massachusetts
with
a
lot
of
people
that
weren't
going
to
vote
for
"trump,"
and
they
poured
up
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
came
in
on
election
day
and
then
you
had
a
senator
running
on
the
republican
party
who
wasn't
exactly
the
greatest
for
"us,"
but
we
have
done
so
well
here
and
we're
going
to
have
a
big
win.
i'm
hearing
we're
going
to
have
a
great
win.
"so,"
i
want
to
thank
"you,"
governor.
also
with
"us,"
our
state
"representatives,"
al
baldasaro
and
fred
doucette.
where
are
you?
hi.
"hi,"
al.
i
know
these
guys
so
well.
hey
"al,"
have
i
taken
care
of
the
vets
better
than
you
even
thought?
this
guy
i
met
him.
he's
a
big
vet.
he
wanted
the
vets.
he
didn't
care
about
anything
"else,"
but
the
vets.
"honestly,"
he
couldn't
have
cared
less
about
anybody
here
except
the
"vets,"
but
i
did
a
good
"job,"
right?
we
did
a
good
job
for
the
vets.
very
"importantly,"
"very,"
very
us

"you,"
matt.
great
people.
a
friend
of
mine
for
a
long
"time,"
he
said
right
from
the
"beginning,"
"\"you're"
going
to
win
this
"state,"
"sir.\""
we
met
him
at
the
primaries.

if
he
said
"no,"
he's
out
of
here.
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
friend
of
the
"state,"
he
loves
this
state
and
he
is
a
smart
cookie.
so
good.
i
love
him
on
television.
he's
no
games.
just
looks
and
gives
her
the
"answer,"
but
he's
done
a
fantastic
job.
the
first
person
on
my
whole
…
you
read
about
all
these
people.
this
is
the
first
guy
and
he's
a
great
guy
and
he's
a
friend
of
"mine,"
corey
lewandowski.
where
is
corey?
great
guy.
tremendous
guy.
tremendous
help.
thank
"you,"
corey.
are
you
having
a
good
"time,"
corey?
who's
going
to
win
this
"year,"
corey?
you
bet.
a
little
bit
slow
with
that
"head,"
corey.
with
the
help
of
everyone
here
"today,"
we've
accomplished
more
in
the
first
three
years.
we've
done
so
much.
we've
done
so
much.
you
can
go
over
at
taxes
and
you
can
go
over
what
we've
done
with
the
military.
we
passed
the
biggest
tax
cuts
"ever,"
ever
the
history
of
our
country.
"now,"
they
want
to
raise
taxes.
think
of
it.
all
my
"life,"
i've
watched
politicians.
don't
"forget,"
i've
only
been
doing
this
for
four
and
a
half
years.
i
haven't
been
to
…
i've
had
senators
come
in.
i've
had
congressmen
come
in.
"\"sir,"
i've
been
doing
this
for
25
years
and
in
25
years
i've
only
lost
three
"races,"
"sir.\""
i
"said,"
"\"but"
i've
only
been
doing
it
for
four
years
and
i
only
won
one
"race,"
but
now
i
have
to
win
two.
one
race
i
"won,"
but
it
was
the
president.
it
was
for
"president.\""
it
was
for
"president,"
but
we
did
the
largest
tax
cut
in
the
history
of
our
country.
we
eliminated
the
most
job
destroying
regulations
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
ended
the
job
killing
paris
climate
accord.
that
was
a
killer.
that
was
meant
to
hurt
the
united
states.
by
the
"way,"
in
case
you
had
any
questions.
"today,"
the
united
states
is
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
on
earth.
to
give
critically
ill
patients
access
to
lifesaving
cures
we
passed
and
hopefully
anybody
here
doesn't
need
it.
nobody
here.
"uh-oh,"
do
you
need
it?
uh-oh.
don't
raise
that
…
oh
she
is?
is
she
okay?
i'll
get
it
for
her.
is
she
okay?
we
got
to
get
her
on
the
list.
tell
me.
"oh,"
from
before.
"well,"
that's
a
long
time
before
i
was
president.
does
she
want
to
get
on
the
list?
because
i've
seen
you
at
rallies
before.
i
want
to
get
…
will
you
"please,"
i
want
to
get
his
wife
on
the
list.
it's
called
right
to
try.
right
to
try.
good
work.
he's
been
a
friend
of
mine.
come
on.
he's
been
here
for
a
long
time.
he's
been
a
good
guy
for
a
long
time.
we
got
to
…
is
your
"wife,"
how
she
doing?
she
couldn't
get
it
before
me.
"well,"
we
had
that
with
mueller.
you
saw
that
with
the
mueller's
last
night.
you
saw
"that,"
right?
was
that
assad
with
their
incredible
"daughter,"
what
happened?
he
said
if
trump
was
president
that
wouldn't
have
happened
and
they're
"right,"
that
would
not
have
happened.
we
took
out
al-baghdadi.
i
wish
i
were
"president,"
you
would
had
a
different
solution.
thank
you.
thank
you.
go
ahead.
how
about
you?
yeah.
we'll
talk
to
you
later.
right
to
try.
you
have
no
idea.
so
many
"people,"
they
used
to
travel
all
over
the
world
to
get
a
cure.
"now,"
we
can
sign
a
quick
simple
document.
it
sounds
"easy,"
it
"wasn't,"
but
it
was
easy
for
me.
i
understood
it.
"now,"
you
signed
a
document.
we
give
you
the
greatest
medicines
even
if
they
haven't
been
approved.
if
somebody's
terminally
"ill,"
like
in
the
case
of
your
"wife,"
if
somebody's
terminally
"ill,"
at
least
you
have
"hope,"
but
it's
beyond
that
because
people
have
gone
home.
you
have
to
see
some
of
the
results
have
been
incredible.
you
saw
one
of
the
people
the
other
"day,"
right?
that
wonderful
young
lady
that
was
so
incredible
and
spoke
so
well.
she's
a
special
person.
she
really
is
a
special
person.
thank
you.
we'll
talk
to
you.
thank
you
very
much.
to
bring
opportunities
to
our
inner
"cities,"
i
signed
the
groundbreaking
criminal
justice
"reform,"
prison
"reform,"
opportunity
"zones,"
permanent
funding
for
historically
black
colleges
and
universities.
true.
before
the
china
virus
came
"in,"
before
that
china
virus
came
"in,"
we
had
the
best
job
numbers
ever
recorded
the
history
of
our
country.
we
had
almost
160
million
americans
working.
we
had
never
had
numbers
like
that.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
abraham
lincoln.
remember
that.
we-
we
stand
for
so
"much,"
including
martin
luther
king's
dream
of
a
nation
where
our
children
are
judged
not
by
the
color
of
their
"skin,"
but
by
the
content
of
their
character.
you
know
that.
the
radical
left's
effort
to
divide
everyone
by
race
tears
us
apart.
there's
so
much
racial
"hatred,"
and
it's
put
there
by
"cnn,"
by
msdnc…
they
stoke
the
flames
and
they
know
it.
the
good
news
is
the
ratings
aren't
great.
so
that's
okay.
they
don't
have
great
ratings.
but
they
stoke
the
flames.
"uh-oh,"
cnn
just
turned
off
their
camera
again.
they
always
turn
off
their
camera.
why
do
i
keep
doing
that?
every
time
i
do
"it,"
they
turn
off
their
camera.
they
did
it
last
time.
i
mention
"cnn,"
they're
"screaming,"
turn
the
camera
off.
our
movement
is
about
a
brighter
future
for
all
americans
of
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
joe
biden
spent
the
last
47
years
betraying
the
african
american
community.
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
delivering
for
the
african
american
community
like
"nobody,"
with
the
exception
possibly
of
abraham
"lincoln,"
has
delivered
before.
it's
true.
my
first
week
in
"office,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
last
administration's
"horrible,"
"stupid,"
insane
trans
pacific
partnership.
would've
destroyed
the
us
auto
industry
and
many
other
industries.
new
hampshire
lost
one
in
"four,"
and
i
think
much
more
than
"that,"
manufacturing
jobs
following
twin
disasters
of
nafta
and
china's
entrance
into
the
wto.
it
was
more
than
one
in
four.
that
statistic
is
wrong.
please
have
it
changed.
the
statistic
is
"wrong,"
far
more
than
one
in
four.
earlier
this
"year,"
i
kept
my
promise
and
replaced
the
nafta
nightmare
with
a
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
agreement.
they
said
that
couldn't
be
done.
i
also
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
pillaging
and
plundering
of
american
jobs.
joe
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
china.
my
agenda
is
made
in
america.
after
years
of
building
up
other
"nations,"
we
are
finally
building
up
our
nation
and
our
"jobs,"
and
we're
taking
care
of
our
people.
last
"night,"
i
got
great
reviews
of
the
speech
and
"all,"
but
some
of
the
fakers
back
"there,"
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
it
was
a
little
long.
he
shouldn't
have
used
the
white
"house.\""
oh
really?
tell
me.
but
they
said
it
was
a
little…
then
one
"person,"
i
think
it
was
chris
wallace.
nice
guy.
he's
actually
a
nice
guy.
he
said
"that,"
"\"he"
didn't
have
the
same
energy
in
the
speech
that
he
usually
"has.\""
"well,"
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
speech.
"tonight,"
i'm
in
new
hampshire
and
we
can
wing
it.
"see,"
"actually,"
actually
"chris,"
who
has
always
wanted
to
be
his
"father,"
but
it
never
worked
out
because
of
a
lack
of
talent.
actually
"though,"
actually
chris
has
it
wrong.
if
i
did
last
night's
speech
"here,"
by
now
you
would
have
all
been
walking
out.
and
if
i
did
tonight's
speech
"there,"
i
would
have
been
criticized
by
being
slightly
radical.
but
we're
having
a
good
time
doing
it
this
"way,"
right?
because
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
under
my
"administration,"
america's
borders
are
more
secure
than
ever
before.
we
ended
the
catch
and
"release,"
stopped
asylum
fraud.
and
we
have
deported
"20,000"
gang
members
and
"500,000"
criminal
aliens.
we've
already
built
300
miles
of
border
wall
and
we're
adding
10
new
miles
every
single
week.
the
wall
will
soon
be
completed.
and
our
numbers
on
the
border
are
the
best
they've
ever
been.
and
by
the
"way,"
mexico
is
paying
for
the
wall.
just
in
case
you
didn't
know
that.
they
don't
know
that.
they're
paying
for
the
wall.
you
haven't
noticed
on
the
wall.
everything
was
"wall,"
wall.
they
didn't
think
i
was
going
to
get
it
done.
because
"look,"
you
have
one
major
party
controlling
congress
and
they
don't
want
to
give
me
a
wall.
so
they're
going
crazy.
"\"wall."
the
wall's
not
getting
"done.\""
then
i
get
it
done.
get
it
from
the
"military,"
get
it
from
everything.
i'm
a
developer.
i
know
how
to
get
money.
it's
one
of
those.
developers
understand.
and
now
that
the
wall
is
almost
"complete,"
it'll
be
soon
complete.
and
it's
the
wall
that
border
security
wanted
so
badly.
this
is
the
one.
but
now
that
it's
"built,"
you
never
hear
about
the
wall.
they
don't
talk
about
it
anymore.
they
don't
talk
about
it
anymore.
it's
incredible.
but
the
wall
will
soon
be
complete.
we've
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military
and
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
us
armed
forces
in
nearly
75
years.
the
space
force.
and
"al,"
in
honor
of
"you,"
we
have
passed
va
choice
and
va
"accountability,"
al.
that
guy's
been
bugging
me
for
years.
al
has
been
bugging
me.
what's
in
that
"hat,"
al?
let
me
see.
let
me…
it's
something.
"al,"
he's
been
bugging
me
for
years.
did
you
ever
think
we'd
get
va
"choice,"
va
accountability?
did
you
ever
really
believe
it?
thank
"you,"
al.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
a
disaster.
$150
billion
we
paid
iran
for
a
basically
short
term
deal.
and
we
gave
them…
what's
more
"impressive,"
we
also
gave
them
$1.8
billion
in
cash.
cash.
many
plane
loads.
you
know
what
that
took?
"many,"
many
plane
"loads,"
$1.8
billion.
i
said
bad.
that's
when
i
realized
how
powerful
a
president
is
in
the
united
states.
when
a
president
has
the
"right,"
which
by
the
"way,"
i
don't
believe
he
did
have
that
"right,"
okay?
when
a
president
has
the
right
to
go
into
the
banks
and
take
out
$1.8
billion
and
hand
it
to
people
that
hate
our
"guts,"
that's
power.
that's
power.
i
don't
believe
he
had
the
right
to
do
it.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
us
embassy
in
jerusalem.
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights
and
we
achieved
the
first
breakthrough
in
the
middle
east
in
25
years.
you
saw
that
just
last
week.
"uae,"
highly
respected.
"mohamed,"
highly
respected.
uae
and
israel.
and
now
they're
all
going
to
be
coming
in.
now
they're
all
"saying,"
"\"how"
come
you
didn't
tell
us
about
"this?\""
you'll
have
peace
in
the
middle
east.
and
yet
we're
moving
our
trips
out.
it's
pretty
"amazing,"
actually.
we'll
get
no
credit
for
"it,"
but
that's
all
right.
remember
that
kaitlan.
cover
that
"properly,"
kaitlan.
we
like
kaitlan.
"together,"
we've
spent
the
last
four
years
cleaning
up
47
years
of
biden
disasters.
joe
biden
has
spent
his
entire
career
on
the
wrong
side
of
history.
he
supported
nafta.
china's
entry.
he's
done
so
many
things.
this
"man,"
if
you
look
at
what
he's
"done,"
we
went
into
a
"deal,"
the
"korea,"
you
know
about
the
korea
deal?
hillary
clinton's
"deal,"
along
with
biden.
they
promised
"250,000"
"jobs,"
right?
"250,000"
jobs.
and
they
were
right.
except
all
those
jobs
went
to
south
korea.
they
didn't
come
to
us.
"00,"
the
polls
close.
and
they
"said,"
"\"donald"
trump
has
won
the
state
of
"texas.\""
simultaneously
with
the
closing.
i'm
now
running
in
texas
against
a
man
who's
against
"oil,"
"guns,"
and
god.
how
do
you
win
texas?
i
said
"this,"
you
could
bring
george
washington
back
as
your
presidential
candidate.
you
could
bring
abraham
lincoln.
let's
put
him
as
the
vice
presidential
candidate.
run
in
texas
and
other
"states,"
you
couldn't
win.
you
couldn't
win.
"now,"
they're
not
going
to
win.
we're
going
to
win
this.
and
you're
against
the
oil
stuff
too.
because
his
whole
thing
on
"oil,"
no
"fracking,"
no
"this,"
no
that.
new
england
has
the
highest
energy
costs
in
the
united
states.
and
you
know
why?
because
governor
cuomo
will
not
let
a
pipeline
go
across
the
tip
of
new
york
state
so
that
oil
and
"gas,"
of
which
we
have
"plenty,"
can
come.
and
do
you
know
where
you
buy
your
energy
from?
russia.
did
you
know
that?
you
have
"ships,"
much
of
it
from
"russia,"
because
governor
"cuomo,"
new
york
won't
allow
a
pipeline
and
they're
desperate
to
have
something
happen
in
upper
new
york
state.
and
those
are
great
"people,"
but
they've
been
treated
very
badly.
but
they
won't
allow
a
pipeline.
by
not
allowing
a
"pipeline,"
we're
trying
to
do
it
through
essentially
eminent
domain.
by
not
allowing
a
pipeline
to
go
through
upper
new
york
state
and
create
a
lot
of
jobs
for
"them,"
you
have
the
highest
energy
prices
in
the
united
states
by
far.
thank
you
new
york.
thank
you.
thank
you
governor
cuomo.
biden
voted
for
the
iraq
war.
i
was
against
the
iraq
war.
he
opposed
a
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
the
killing
of
soleimani.
you
remember
that
one?
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
isis
and
he
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
positive
development
for
america
and
for
the
world.
that's
not
a
positive
development.
before
they
went
into
the
"wto,"
china
was
flat
lined.
for
years
and
years
and
"decades,"
flat
lined.
and
then
they
got
into
the
wto
and
a
lot
of
bad
things
happened.
first
china's
stole
our
"jobs,"
plundered
our
intellectual
property
and
unleashed
the
virus.
and
now
china
is
trying
to
just
hug
and
kiss
joe
biden.
they
want
him
so
badly.
"look,"
if
you
like
"china,"
you
should
vote
for
"biden,"
that
i
can
tell
you.
how
about
his
son?
you
think
the
"son,"
maybe
there's
a
conflict?
how
about
his
son?
where's
hunter?
where
is
hunter?
where
is
hunter?
does
anybody
know?
where's
hunter?
he's
in
another
country
right
"now,"
"probably,"
ripping
off
another
country.
"no,"
as
soon
as
biden
became
vice
"president,"
bad
things
happened
with
respect
to
a
hunter.
if
that
happened
with
respect
to
my
"family,"
i
wouldn't
be
standing.
i
guarantee
you
that.
i
guarantee
you
that.
what
a
disgrace.
what
a
disgrace.
ukraine.
and
it's
not
just
ukraine
and
it's
not
just
china.
but
he
goes
into
"china,"
takes
out
$1.5
billion
to
"manage,"
and
he
knows
"nothing,"
and
he
wasn't
even
employed.
he
got
thrown
out
of
the
armed
services.
so
give
me
a
break.
it's
a
"disgrace,"
what's
happening.
there's
a
double…
there's
a
thing
happening
with
the
media
like
nobody's
ever
seen
before.
these
people
right
here.
because
if
that
happened
to
a
"republican,"
in
particular.
if
any
of
that
stuff
happened
to
"me,"
it
would
be
brutal.
but
it
happened
to
him.
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
and
how
about
the
questions
asked
by
anderson
cooper
yesterday?
anderson
cooper.
he's
interviewed
me
a
lot
over
the
years
and
i
always
got
along
with
"him,"
but
they
were
tough
interviews.
did
you
hear
the
questions?
and
biden
kept
looking
down.
i
think
he
was
reading
the
answers
off
a
teleprompter.
right?
i
think
he
was
reading
the
answers
off
a
teleprompter.
and
that's
happened
before.
and
how
about
david
muir
of
abc?
he's
a
nice
"guy,"
right?
how
soft
were
those
questions?
how
soft
were
those?
they
don't
ask
me
questions
like
that.
they
got
fire
pouring
out
of
their
eyes.
no.
"\"mr."
vice
"president,"
what
do
you
think
of
this?
how
was
your
"breakfast,"
sir?
did
you
enjoy
"it?\""
when
i
banned
travel
from
china
"biden,"
called
it
hysterical
and
xenophobic.
he
even
"used,"
somewhere
along
the
"line,"
the
word
racist.
he
always
"figures,"
they
always
want
to
get
that
word
in
there.
if
we
had
listened
to
"joe,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
americans
would
have
died.
but
instead
my
"decision,"
saved
thousands
and
thousands
of
lives.
and
then
we
banned
europe
very
early
because
i
saw
what
was
going
"on,"
really
in
italy
and
spain
and
france.
when
the
virus
"arrived,"
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
ii.
mike
pence
did
a
great
job.
we
produced
more
than
"100,000"
ventilators
within
weeks.
and
not
a
single
american
who
has
needed
a
ventilator
has
been
denied
a
"ventilator,"
not
one.
you
heard
all
"about,"
and
now
we're
producing
ventilators.
hard
to
produce.
"expensive,"
complex.
we're
producing
them
now
for
the
rest
of
the
world.
188
countries
were
affected
by
this.
we
pioneered
advances
in
treatment
that
have
reduced
the
monthly
rate.
and
you
look
at
"this,"
the
mortality
rate
has
been
reduced
by
85%
since
april.
think
of
that.
85%
since
april.
under
operation
warp
"speed,"
three
different
vaccines
are
right
now
in
final
stage
trials.
if
you
go
back
three
"years,"
that
would
have
been
something
that
would
have
been
impossible
to
even
discuss.
it
would
have
taken
years.
we
will
produce
a
vaccine
this
year
and
together
we
will
defeat
the
virus.
it's
already
getting
defeated.
and
by
the
"way,"
another
big
democrat
hoax.
another
big
hoax.
i
want
football
back.
i'm
the
one
that's
been
saying.
is
that
a
correct
statement?
i
want
football
back.
these
are
"young,"
strong
guys.
they're
not
going
to
be
affected
by
the
virus.
if
you
look
at
"it,"
it's
generally
older
people.
older
people
that
have
heart
"conditions,"
that
have
"diabetes,"
that
have
problems.
these
are
big
strong
guys.
they'll
be
just
fine.
but
i
want
football
back.
i've
been
calling
for
football
to
be
"back,"
including
big
10.
big
"10,"
get
with
it.
open
up
your
"season,"
big
10.
and
the
dems
don't
want
it
back
for
political
reasons.
but
now
their
new
line…
this
is
like
"russia,"
"russia,"
russia.
all
this
crap
they
come
up
with.
now
their
new
line
is
they
are
trying
to
blame
me
and
keep
football
shut
down.
they
want
to
keep
it
shut
down.
and
they're
saying
that
president
trump
shut
it
down.
i'm
the
one
that
wants
it
open.
so
they're
reversing
it.
they're
playing
a
big
con
game.
it's
just
a
con
game.
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
and
we
have
to
defeat
them
on
november
3rd.
i
want
football
back
and
big
10
open.
and
now
the
other
"day,"
joe
biden
came
up
with
a
plan
to
impose
a
blanket
shutdown.
he'd
be
willing
to
do
another
blanket.
and
we
had
to
do
it.
we
"blanket,"
we
shut
down.
we
saved
millions
of
lives.
instead
of
the
number
we
have
"today,"
"175,000,"
we
could
have
had
2
million
today
instead.
it
would
have
been
"unacceptable,"
unsustainable.
unsustainable.
we
did
everything
right.
we
did
it
right.
we
closed
it
down.
we
stopped
china.
we
stopped
europe.
now
we're
opening
it
up
and
we're
opening
it
up
to
record
"numbers,"
despite
the
fact
that
the
democrats
are
keeping
their
states
shut
down
and
hurting
people
that
live
in
those
"states,"
shut
down
as
long
as
possible.
but
now
biden
wants
to
do
another
blanket
"shutdown,"
"possibly,"
that
would
decimate
the
economy
and
cause
"suicides,"
drug
"overdoses,"
alcohol
"abuse,"
heart
"attacks,"
joblessness.
you'd
have
"jobs,"
all
of
the
problems
that
it
causes.
because
it's
not
just
a
one
sided
equation.
a
shut
down
causes
big
problems
also.
and
at
this
"point,"
when
the
economy
is
roaring
back.
we
had
record
job
numbers
this
last
"quarter,"
over
9
million
jobs.
we're
going
to
throw
that
all
out?
we
have
a
market…
you
"know,"
your
stock
market.
who
has
401k's
here?
your
401k's
and
your
"stocks,"
when
you
have
"stocks,"
would
be
obliterated.
and
right
"now,"
we
have
"just,"
on
two
of
your
"markets,"
as
you
"know,"
s&p
and
"nasdaq,"
you're
at
new
records.
and
you're
about
to
hit
another
new
record.
think
of
it.
who
would
have
thought
the
stock
market?
and
hopefully
we're
at
the
end
of
this
horrible
china
virus.
came
from
china.
they
should
have
stopped
it
and
they
did.
but
who
would
have
"thought,"
just
who
would
have
thought
that
the
stock
market
is
at
record
levels
right
now?
record
levels.
and
everything
else
is
going
to
follow.
before
the
"virus,"
we
created
an
economic
miracle
and
now
we're
doing
it
again.
we
did
the
paycheck
protection
program
where
we
saved
more
than
"200,000"
jobs
in
new
hampshire
alone.
"200,000,"
right?
over
the
past
three
"months,"
we've
gained
so
many
"different,"
if
you
look
at
retail
numbers.
take
a
look
at
our
retail
numbers.
they're
literally
at
records.
look
at
some
of
the
numbers
be
announced
by
companies.
they're
at
records.
can
you
imagine
giving
that
all
up
and
starting
again?
it's
not
acceptable.
if
i'm
"reelected,"
we
will
create
10
million
jobs
over
the
next
10
"months,"
and
we'll
do
that
easily.
the
biden
"agenda,"
with
big
tax
increases
and
big
regulation
"increases,"
would
immediately
kill
everything.
you
will
go
into
a
depression.
and
i'm
very
good
at
predicting
this.
you
will
go
into
a
depression
the
likes
of
which
this
country
has
not
seen
since
"1929,"
and
who
"knows,"
maybe
worse
than
that.
they
are
playing
a
suicide
mission.
…
be
worse
than
that.
they
are
playing
a
suicide
mission
if
they
want
to
raise
your
taxes.
they
want
to
raise
your
taxes
by
$4
trillion.
and
that's
going
to
be
almost
everybody.
they're
saying
for
the
rich.
"no,"
not
for
the
rich.
they're
going
to
be
raising
everybody's
taxes
almost.
joe
biden
is
running
on
the
most
extreme
far
left
platform
of
any
nominee
in
american
history
and
of
our
foreign
"adversaries,"
we're
devising
a
plan
to
destroy
the
united
states
from
within.
all
they
have
to
look
is
at
the
biden
harris.
how
about
her?
is
she
a
beauty?
what
a
beauty
that
is.
they
pick
a
woman
who
starts
off…
she
starts
off
sort
of
strong.
she's
one
of
the
favorites.
within
a
period
of
a
few
"months,"
she
goes
"down,"
down
"15,"
"12,"
"11,"
"nine,"
"eight,"
"five,"
"three,"
two.
then
she
"goes,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
leave
because
i've
decided
that
i
want
to
leave.
i
want
to
"leave.\""
she
left
because
she
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
votes.
she
was
terrible.
this
would
be
your
president
possibly.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
want
to
see
the
first
woman
president
"also,"
but
i
don't
want
to
see
a
woman
president
get
into
that
position
the
way
she
do
it
and
she's
not
competent.
she's
not
competent.
they're
all
saying
we
want
ivanka.
i
don't
blame
them.
they
want
to
eliminate
america's
borders
in
the
middle
of
a
"pandemic,"
suspend
all
"deportations,"
restore
catch
and
"release,"
and
expand
"horrible,"
"dangerous,"
disgusting
sanctuary
cities.
they
want
to
give
illegal
aliens
government
healthcare
and
taxpayer
funded
lawyers.
that's
what
we
need
is
more
lawyers.
let's
get
some
more
lawyers
into
the
act.
they
want
to
end
national
security
travel
bands
from
jihadist
"nations,"
very
"dangerous,"
and
increase
refugee
admissions
by
700%.
this
is
in
the
bernie
"sanders,"
crazy
"bernie,"
you
know
crazy
bernie.
a
lot
of
his
people
are
going
to
vote
for
me
just
like
they
did
last
time.
you
know
why?
because
of
trade.
because
i
agree
with
bernie
"sanders,"
but
my
trade
policies
are
much
tougher
than
his
and
i'm
able
to
do
it.
all
you
have
to
do
is
how
is
china
doing
last
year
with
my
trade
policy?
not
too
well.
and
we
had
the
best
year
we've
ever
had.
we're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
bernie
sanders
voters
because
they
like
my
attitude
on
trade.
they
really
like
it
because
i've
been
telling
people
for
years
our
country
is
being
ripped
off
by
china
and
many
other
"countries,"
"including,"
i
hate
to
say
"it,"
our
allies.
our
allies
have
been
ripping
us
big.
and
you
heard
me
say
last
"night,"
"nato,"
i
got
$130
billion
from
them
first
time
going
up
to
$400
billion
a
year
from
nato
"countries,"
by
"saying,"
"\"you"
got
to
do
it.
you
got
to
do
"it.\""
and
general
secretary
stoltenberg
said
it
can't
be
done.
he
could
not
believe
it.
he's
actually
my
biggest
fan
and
nobody
ever
calls
him
for
a
quote.
call
him
sometime.
they
want
to
abolish
cash
bail
and
cut
funding
for
law
enforcement.
they
want
to
end…
we
want
to
increase
law
"enforcement,"
not
cut
law
enforcement.
and
by
the
"way,"
pat
lynch
is
a
great
"guy,"
new
"york,"
new
york.
really
"great,"
new
york's
"finest,"
right?
their
rights
have
been
taken
away
from
them.
literally
they're
not
allowed
to
do
their
"job,"
but
pay
"lynch,"
he
said
the
first
time
in
history
that
they
know
of
new
york's
finest
have
endorsed
a
candidate.
the
candidate
is
donald
trump.
first
time
they've
done
it.
all
over
the
"country,"
the
sheriffs
of
"florida,"
all
of
"texas,"
all
over
the
"country,"
"ohio,"
law
enforcement's
endorsing
trump.
i
cannot
imagine
them
getting
any
law
enforcement
endorsements.
if
they
"do,"
please
let
me
know
and
we'll
have
a
little
discussion.
we'll
ask
why
did
that
happen?
they
want
to
end
school
choice
and
ban
charter
schools.
they
want
to
abolish
american
"energy,"
including
all
of
the
things
i
said
before.
and
add
to
that
coal
and
add
to
that
shale.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
"jobs,"
a
bright
"future,"
the
american
dream
for
all
americans.
there
is
no
limit
to
what
we
can
achieve
with
four
more
years.
so
in
"conclusion,"
i
have
to
say
this.
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we
will
make
america
into
the
manufacturing
super
power
of
the
world
that's
happening
already.
we
will
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we'll
do
it
here.
like
we
used
to
do
in
the
good
old
days
before
we
owed
trillions
of
dollars.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increase
penalties
for
assaults
on
law
"enforcement,"
surge
federal
prosecutors
into
high
crime
communities
and
neighborhoods
and
ban
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
kill
our
terrorist's
enemies
as
we've
been
doing
while
keeping
america
out
of
the
endless
foreign
wars.
i
go
to
dover
and
i
greet
these
incredible
families
of
soldiers
that
have
been
so
sadly
killed.
so
sadly
killed.
it's
such
a
shame.
i
go
to
the
"hospital,"
i
go
to
walter
reed
medical
center.
it's
incredible.
the
doctors
are
so
talented.
i
see
what
they
can
"do,"
but
soldiers
so
badly
hurt.
and
they're
really
acting
as
police.
they're
acting
as
police.
"now,"
we're
very
low
in
afghanistan
now
in
terms
of
numbers
of
troops.
we're
getting
out.
we'll
be
getting
out
soon.
we're
very
low
in
iraq.
we're
very
low
in
"syria,"
except
we
kept
the
oil.
we
left
some
behind
for
the
oil.
if
you
don't
"mind,"
we
kept
the
oil.
we
should
have
kept
the
oil
in
iraq
like
i've
been
saying.
we'll
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
and
justices
who
believe
in
enforcing
the
"law,"
not
their
own
political
"agenda,"
which
is
what
we
have
in
many
cases
right
now.
the
next
president
will
be
in
my
"opinion,"
responsible
for
"two,"
"three,"
"four,"
and
"maybe,"
maybe
even
five
us
supreme
court
justices.
you
better
vote
for
"me,"
you
better
vote
for
me
or
you're
going
to
have
the
greatest
depression
you've
ever
seen.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
speech
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
second
amendment.
we
will
surprise
medical
billing
"require,"
it's
already
done.
i
signed
it.
nobody
can
believe
i
did
it.
price
transparency.
you
know
what
that
is?
do
you
know
how
big
that
is?
where
you're
able
to
actually
negotiate
with
"hospitals,"
see
their
"prices,"
compare
it.
you
know
who
likes
it?
good
hospitals
and
good
doctors.
other
people
don't
like
it.
it's
the
biggest
thing
and
nobody
even
talks
about
"it,"
but
i've
already
put
it
into
effect.
the
bad
news
is
it
goes
into
effect
on
january
1st.
you
better
make
sure
you
elect
me
so
i
get
credit
for
it.
"otherwise,"
could
you
imagine
if
sleepy
joe
got
in
and
medical
prices
and
drug
prices
and
everything
had
"dropped,"
but
he
"said,"
"\"i"
wonder
what
"happened?\""
and
i
did
it
all.
i'll
be
so
angry
at
new
hampshire.
i'll
never
speak
to
you
again.
"now,"
all
these
"things,"
what
we're
doing
with
"drugs,"
we
instituted
a
favored
nations
laws.
we
instituted
favored
nations.
that's
going
to
drop
your
prices
"50,"
"60,"
70%.
and
i'm
the
only
president
in
51
"years,"
last
"year,"
drug
prices
went
down
a
"little,"
not
"much,"
but
they
went
down
the
first
time
in
51
years.
favored
nations
could
drop
at
"50,"
"60,"
or
70%.
on
top
of
"that,"
i
instituted
rebates
where
the
rebates
go
toward
price
reductions
and
back
to
the
customer
instead
of
to
a
middleman.
so
we
will
protect
medicare
and
we
will
protect
social
security
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions.
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
plant
its
beautiful
american
flag.
do
we
love
our
american
flag?
or
mars.
above
"all,"
we
will
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
to
honor
our
history
and
be
inspired
by
the
words
of
the
new
hampshire
state
motto.
have
you
ever
heard
of
these
words?
live
free
or
die.
live
free
or
die.
vote
for
those
people.
and
you
"do,"
you
have
a
great
governor.
vote
for
your
"people,"
vote
for
your
governor.
you
have
a
great
governor.
from
portsmouth
to
dixville
from
concord
to
keene.
i
know
a
friend
from
keene.
great
guy.
i
had
a
friend
from
keene
a
long
time.
"keene,"
new
hampshire.
and
merrimack
to
"manchester,"
we
will
fight
for
every
"job,"
every
family
and
every
neighborhood.
we
will
fight
for
every
vote.
we
have
to
win.
we
have
no
choice.
can
i
be
honest
with
you?
we're
working
hard.
we're
all
working.
i
don't
have
to
do
this.
i
could
get
off
that
beautiful
plane
that
used
to
be
black
and
white
with
a
red
stripe.
that
was
mine.
but
that's
air
force
one.
i
get
off
that
beautiful
plane.
i
could
come
up
and
"say,"
"\"ladies"
and
gentlemen
of
new
"hampshire,"
you
have
no
choice.
you
have
to
vote
for
me
because
if
you
"don't,"
you'll
be
put
in
radical
lefties.
you'll
have
a
depression.
your
stocks
will
be
worthless.
your
401ks
will
be
gone.
there'll
be
crime
all
over
your
streets.
so
i'm
not
going
to
work
at
all.
i'm
leaving
"now,"
but
you
have
to
vote
for
me
because
you
have
no
"choice.\""
right?
i
could
say
it.
right?
right?
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
american
heroes
who
crossed
the
"oceans,"
blazed
the
"trail,"
settled
the
"continent,"
tamed
the
"wilderness,"
laid
down
the
railroads.
won
two
world
"wars,"
defeated
fascism
and
communism
and
made
america
the
greatest
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
we
are
making
it
greater.
we
will
be
greater
than
ever
before.
incredible
citizens
like
"you,"
the
people
of
new
"hampshire,"
helped
build
this
country.
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
not
going
to
let
the
radical
left
socialists
or
communists
take
our
country.
we're
not
going
to
let
it.
we're
returning
power
to
you
the
american
people.
with
your
"help,"
your
devotion
and
your
"drive,"
we
are
going
to
keep
on
working.
we
are
going
to
keep
on
fighting
and
we
are
going
to
keep
on
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning.
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
nation
under
god.
and
we
don't
take
the
beautiful
word
god
out
of
our
pledge
of
"allegiance,"
do
we?
they
did
it
twice.
they
it
twice.
then
they
"say,"
"\"well,"
we
didn't
mean
"that.\""
"oh,"
i
see.
i
was
listening
once
they
"said,"
"\"that's"
"right.\""
you
don't
know
what
it
"is,"
what
happened?
what
happened?
they
did
it
on
purpose.
they
did
it
twice.
that's
where
they're
coming
from.
you
can
be
fools
and
you
can
be
"fooled,"
but
that's
where
they're
coming
from.
so
don't
be
"surprised,"
but
they're
not
going
to
get
there.
we're
not
going
to
let
it
happen.
we're
not
going
to
let
our
country
be
destroyed
by
a
bunch
of
nut
jobs.
america
will
soon
be
thriving
like
never
before
and
together
with
the
people
of
new
hampshire
that
have
meant
so
much
to
"me,"
and
i
brought
down
opioid
and
i
brought
down
drug
problems
for
you
by
19%
and
nobody
even
talks
about
it.
19.
i
talk
about
new
hampshire
a
lot
because
you
had
one
of
the
proportionally
worst
problems
of
any
"country,"
of
any
state
in
this
incredible
country.
you
had
one
of
the
worst
problems
of
any
of
the
states.
and
i
talk
about
you
a
lot.
it
was
incredible.
and
you
still
have.
but
we
brought
it
down
19%
and
people
are
absolutely
shocked.
if
it
weren't
for
the
china
"plague,"
the
number
would
be
25
or
30%.
that
really
hurt
us
because
people
sort
of
went
back
to
some
old
ways
because
they
don't
want
to
be
shut
down
any
longer.
"joe,"
don't
you
understand
that?
they
don't
want
to
be
shut
down.
so
i
worked
very
hard
on
that
for
this
state
and
for
other
"states,"
but
this
was
a
state
that
was
so
severely
impacted
with
the
drug
problem.
that
wall
is
stopping
them
and
it's
stopping
them
like
never
before.
it's
stopping
them
like
never
before.
i
want
to
thank
new
hampshire
for
all
you've
done
for
me.
i
want
to
thank
new
hampshire.
you
were
my
first
"victory,"
as
i
"said,"
but
you
are
going
to
lead
a
nation
to
the
most
important
victory
and
the
most
important
election
that
we've
ever
had.
we
will
make
america
wealthy
again.
we
will
make
america
strong
again.
we
will
make
america
proud
again.
we
will
make
america
safe
"again,"
and
we
will
make
america
great
again.
thank
you.
thank
you.]
[thank
"you,"
thank
you.
wow.
"wow,"
and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
here
with
you
in
henderson.
thousands
of
"loyal,"
"hard-working,"
great
american
patriots.
and
51
days
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
win
"nevada,"
and
we're
going
to
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
and
after
we
win
four
more
"years,"
we'll
ask
for
maybe
another
four
or
so.
"well,"
thank
you
very
much.
whenever
i
say
that
…
look
at
all
that
news
back
"there,"
look
at
all
that
fake
news.
when
i
say
"that,"
their
heads
explode.
our
movement
is
"pro-jobs,"
"pro-worker,"
"pro-police,"
and
100%
pro-american.
as
we
begin
"tonight,"
our
thoughts
are
with
the
two
sheriff's
deputies
in
los
angeles
who
were
fighting
for
their
lives
when
a
vicious
criminal
walked
up
to
their
vehicle
and
shot
them
at
point
blank
range.
"tonight,"
we
send
our
love
and
our
support
to
their
"families,"
and
we
pray
to
god
for
their
recovery.
the
radical
left
in
america
is
waging
open
war
on
law
enforcement.
hundreds
of
officers
nationwide
have
been
injured
in
left-wing
riots
and
mobs.
you
see
"it,"
you
see
it
all
the
time.
"please,"
sit
down.
"please,"
let's
have
a
little
fun.
we
got
plenty
of
time.
i
"mean,"
here
it
is.
i
"mean,"
what
do
we
have?
football
is
boring
as
hell.
it's
just
not
the
same.
right?
i
don't
know.
used
to
be
people
would
"say,"
"\"hey,"
could
you
keep
it
away
from
a
football
"game?\""
now
they're
"saying,"
"\"could"
you
possibly
do
it
during
the
football
"game?\""
we
have
some
free
time.
but
during
violent
demonstrations
in
las
"vegas,"
a
29-year-old
police
"officer,"
you
know
this
very
"well,"
was
deliberately
shot
in
the
"head,"
leaving
the
"young,"
brave
officer
"paralyzed,"
"yet,"
sleepy
joe
biden
and
his
supporters
continue
their
dangerous
war
on
the
police.
they're
putting
the
lives
of
our
brave
officers
directly
in
harm's
way.
at
his
"convention,"
he
never
even
mentioned
the
"words,"
"\"law"
and
"order\","
never
mentioned
them
once.
"now,"
he's
all
of
a
"sudden,"
his
polls
are
dropping
like
a
"rock,"
and
he's
starting
to
"say,"
"\"but"
we
need
law
and
"order.\""
and
then
he
goes
back
into
the
basement
for
four
days.
what
happens
to
this
guy?
i
know
what
happens
to
him.
he's
shot.
that's
what
happened
to
him.
every
once
in
a
"while,"
the
great
dana
white
…
does
anybody
know
dana
white?
he's
got
some
champions
with
him
tonight.
he's
here.
i
got
to
introduce
him.
but
every
once
in
a
"while,"
i'll
ask
"him,"
"\"what"
happened
to
that
"guy?\""
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
he's
been
shot
for
the
last
…
long
"time.\""
should
have
left
a
long
time
ago.
that's
joe
biden.
joe
"biden,"
he's
"shot,"
and
everybody
knows
it.
and
you
know
what?
they
ought
to
be
"ashamed,"
because
they
do
interviews
with
"him,"
they
give
him
the
"questions,"
and
they
let
him
read
the
answer
from
a
"teleprompter,"
and
that's
the
fake
news.
it
is.
how
about
the
other
day?
could
you
move
that
a
little
bit
closer.
see
these
things?
move
it
a
little
bit.
i
must
tell
you
at
great
"peril,"
i
used
them
"seldom,"
but
those
are
the
times
we
have
the
best
fun
"too,"
i
will
say.
and
that's
actually
when
we
learn
the
most.
for
the
entire
"summer,"
biden
was
silent
as
left-wing
mobs
assaulted
police
officers.
when
biden's
far-left
supporters
set
fire
to
police
cars
and
precinct
"stations,"
court
"houses,"
joe
biden
called
them
peaceful
protestors.
right?
they
call
them
peaceful
protestors.
and
when
we
go
to
these
radical-left
place
that
are
having
"problems,"
because
everyone
…
look
at
the
top-10.
you
go
back
…
go
"top-20,"
top-30.
take
a
look.
"democrat-run,"
radical
"left-wing,"
"democrat,"
usually
run.
not
"republican-run,"
democrat-run.
and
we
go
"back,"
and
we
take
a
look.
we
want
to
give
them
help.
they
don't
want
help.
but
when
they
do
ask
for
"help,"
and
when
they
"do,"
we
go
in.
like
"minneapolis,"
the
national
guard
went
"in,"
took
35
minutes
to
quell
a
situation
that
went
on
for
two
weeks.
they
knew
we
were
going
in
to
seattle.
we
told
"them,"
"\"we're"
going
in
tomorrow
"morning.\""
and
"so,"
they
sent
them
in.
they
didn't
want
that
to
"happen,"
and
we
let
the
protestors
"know,"
or
whatever
you
call
them.
they're
really
"anarchists,"
they're
not
protestors.
so
we
let
the
anarchists
know
that
we
were
going
in
with
approximately
"10,000"
very
tough
"people,"
and
they
immediately
raised
their
"hands,"
and
the
seattle
"police,"
who
by
the
"way,"
could
do
a
great
job
if
they
were
let
to
do
their
"job,"
but
they're
"not,"
they're
not.
and
as
you
"know,"
in
"portland,"
the
other
"day,"
we
had
to
send
in
the
us
marshalls.
a
"man,"
who's
a
bad
"guy,"
bad
"guy,"
shot
somebody
right
in
the
middle
of
the
"street,"
who
they
say
was
a
very
fine
young
man.
shot
"him,"
killed
him.
just
shot
him
like
…
it
was
on
television.
two-and-a-half
"days,"
nothing
happened.
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
going
"on?\""
we
sent
in
the
us
marshalls.
it
was
taken
care
of
in
15
minutes.
okay?
15
minutes.
when
asked
if
he
would
cut
police
"funding,"
sleepy
joe
"said,"
"\"absolutely,"
"yes,"
i
"would.\""
now
he's
trying
to
change
his
mind.
you
ever
see
a
guy
…
he
changed
his
mind
on
fracking.
okay?
"\"there"
will
be
no
"fracking.\""
you
know
that?
he
went
all
throughout
the
debates.
he
doesn't
even
know
what
fracking
"is,"
i
guarantee
you.
he
was
told
to
say
that
by
bernie
and
the
radical
left
and
his
vice
president.
by
the
"way,"
how
bad
is
she?
she
is
the
worst.
we're
going
to
have
a
woman
president
some
day.
not
going
to
be
"her,"
not
going
to
be
her.
and
that's
no
way
to
attain
the
office.
we
got
in
there
because
sleepy
joe
couldn't
handle
it
anymore.
joe
is
bad
primetime.
"see,"
the
reason
i
can
talk
so
badly
about
"him,"
because
he
did
an
"ad,"
where
he
had
me
standing
over
the
grave
and
the
graves
of
our
fallen
heroes
from
many
years
"ago,"
and
they
said
…
and
nobody
loves
the
military
more.
look
what
i've
done
for
"them,"
$2.5
trillion.
and
in
the
"ad,"
they
have
me
saying
horrible
things
in
front
of
other
people.
nobody
would
have
put
up
with
that.
it's
called
disinformation.
they
make
up
a
total
"lie,"
they
put
it
"out,"
then
they
do
ads.
so
once
he
did
"that,"
i
"said,"
"\"now,"
"really,"
"look,"
it's
okay.
it's
"okay,"
because
now
the
gloves
are
"off.\""
i
can
say
that
this
man
is
totally
unfit
to
be
president.
up
"here,"
he's
totally
unfit.
he
can't
be
your
president.
i've
gotten
to
know
president
xi
of
china.
i've
gotten
to
know
president
putin
of
russia.
and
by
the
"way,"
getting
along
with
them
is
good.
although
"china,"
i
must
tell
"you,"
got
a
real
problem
with
china.
what
they
did
with
"us,"
we
can
never
forget
that.
we
made
a
great
trade
deal.
the
ink
wasn't
dry
when
the
plague
came
in
from
china.
they
stopped
it
from
going
into
"china,"
but
they
didn't
stop
it
from
going
into
our
"country,"
europe
and
the
rest
of
the
world.
okay?
they
could
have
done
that.
but
you
"see,"
i
deal
with
all
of
these
"people,"
and
they
don't
have
the
kind
of
mental
problem
that
sleepy
joe
has.
they're
very
sharp.
kim
jong-un.
kim
jong-un
doesn't
know
about
the
problems
that
joe
has.
we
need
very
sharp
people.
i'm
sorry.
joe
is
not
qualified
for
this
position.
joe
calls
for
abolishing
cash
bail
and
closing
your
prisons.
he
wants
to
close
"prisons,"
and
he
even
called
law
enforcement
the
enemy
recently.
you
saw
that?
the
"enemy,"
until
his
polls
started
dropping.
then
all
of
a
"sudden,"
he
"said,"
"\"no,"
we
love
law
"enforcement.\""
i
think
i've
gotten
every
major
law
enforcement
group
in
the
"country,"
right?
you
saw
"recently,"
i
got
new
york's
finest.
and
they
are
new
york's
"finest,"
but
they're
not
allowed
to
do
their
job.
they're
not
allowed.
we
have
a
radical
left
mayor
who
has
no
clue.
he
has
no
clue
what's
happening
to
that
poor
city.
i
love
that
city.
what's
happening
to
that
city.
300%
up.
"look,"
300%
in
certain
very
bad
"crimes,"
new
york.
there's
no
reason
for
"this,"
and
we
have
the
greatest
police.
they're
great.
new
york's
"finest,"
they
endorsed
me.
"chicago,"
fraternal
order
of
police.
chicago
endorsed
"me,"
oklahoma
endorsed
"me,"
texas
endorsed
"me,"
florida
endorsed
me.
every
place
endorsed
me.
and
if
you
think
it's
easy
for
new
york
and
chicago
and
these
different
places
…
ohio
endorsed
me.
if
you
think
it's
easy
for
these
guys.
they
never
endorse.
new
"york,"
they
said
they
cannot
remember
ever
having
endorsed
a
presidential
candidate.
they
endorsed
"me,"
and
they're
against
their
radical
left
culture
that's
destroying
the
city.
so
i
was
very
honored.
but
how
about
chicago?
do
you
think
it's
easy
for
these
great
police
in
chicago
to
endorse
me?
it's
not
"easy,"
but
they
felt
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
do
it.
so
it
just
happened.
i'm
just
very
honored
by
it.
and
biden's
anti-police
crusade
must
stop.
it's
got
to
"stop,"
it's
got
to
stop
now.
"furthermore,"
the
"corporations,"
these
"poor,"
stupid
people
that
run
the
…
they
got
paid
a
lot
of
money.
they're
"weak,"
ineffective
"people,"
let's
face
it.
they're
funding
anti-police
organizations
and
other
organizations
that
are
…
it's
so
embarrassing.
and
i
don't
mean
for
a
little.
they
gave
$100
million
and
250
…
you're
talking
about
serious
money.
you're
talking
about
serious
"money,"
and
that
money
is
not
used
for
good
reasons.
and
these
stupid
corporations
…
and
they'll
be
the
first
to
go
if
the
radical
left
ever
took
…
they'd
throw
those
guys
out
like
they
were
nothing.
if
they
were
"lucky,"
they'd
just
be
thrown
out.
it
would
probably
be
a
lot
rougher
than
that.
these
people
don't
know
what
they're
getting
into.
but
instead
of
giving
"money,"
they
should
give
money
to
the
families
of
the
crime
victims
and
the
fallen
officers.
that's
what
they
should
do.
so
in
the
republican
"party,"
we
know
that
police
officers
are
not
"villains,"
but
the
heroes
who
risk
their
lives
to
keep
us
safe.
and
they
guard
…
the
thing
that's
incredible
…
i
know
so
many
"police,"
they're
so
"good,"
one
bad
"apple,"
and
they're
on
for
months.
one
bad
"apple,"
they
go
on
for
months.
the
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
good
"things,"
nobody
talks
about
it.
these
are
great
people
that
have
done
a
great
"job,"
and
we
have
to
support
our
law
enforcement.
so
biden
wants
to
appease
the
domestic
"terrorists,"
and
my
plan
is
to
arrest
domestic
terrorists.
okay?
and
we
also
believe
that
if
you
murder
a
police
"officer,"
you
should
receive
the
death
"penalty,"
and
that's
something
that's
very
important
fine
people.
i
"mean,"
they're
in
very
grave
"condition,"
as
you
know.
fine
people.
he's
an
"animal,"
and
i
called
him
an
"animal,"
and
i
was
criticized
by
"people,"
calling
him
an
animal.
they
said
he's
a
human
being.
he's
not
a
human
being.
he's
an
animal.
he's
not
a
human
being.
joe
biden
opposes
the
death
penalty
even
for
cops
who
…
i
"mean,"
"look,"
you
have
to
"see,"
even
for
these
cop
killers
who
go
"around,"
the
"predators,"
they
murder
children.
people
like
the
boston
bomber.
he
opposes
the
death
penalty
for
the
boston
bomber.
he
wants
to
give
prisoners
a
vote.
he
wants
to
have
the
boston
bomber
be
able
to
vote.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
you
know
who's
thought
of
that?
bernie
"sanders,"
crazy
bernie.
he
wants
to
have
…
crazy
"bernie,"
he
"says,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
they
have
to
"vote.\""
so
they
asked
"him,"
"\"well,"
does
that
mean
every
…
"\""
that
means
everybody
that's
in
prisons
should
be
entitled
to
a
"vote,"
right?
so
they
actually
"said,"
"\"well,"
what
about
the
boston
bomber?
should
he
"entitled?\""
and
bernie
"goes,"
"\"yeah,"
he
should
be
"entitled.\""
bernie
is
crazy.
but
the
fact
"is,"
that
we
got
a
lot
of
bernie
votes
four
years
"ago,"
because
bernie's
right
about
one
"thing,"
trade.
because
all
of
these
"countries,"
friend
and
"foe,"
they
ripoff
the
united
states.
we
have
made
so
many
great
trade
"deals,"
and
you
see
"it,"
usmca.
we
got
rid
of
nafta.
so
many.
but
biden
is
too
weak
to
be
"president,"
and
he's
not
a
smart
person.
and
by
the
"way,"
he
wasn't
smart
25
years
ago.
everybody
knew
it.
now
we
don't
even
have
to
discuss
the
matter.
but
i
was
going
to
"say,"
when
he
put
that
ad
"up,"
we
told
him
to
take
it
down.
when
he
put
that
ad
"up,"
that
dishonored
our
fallen
heroes.
they
are
"great,"
great
heroes
of
"mine,"
of
"yours,"
of
everybody's.
i
know
really
bad
people.
no
bad
"person,"
the
worst
person
i
"know,"
i
know
some
beauties
from
new
york.
i
know
some
developers
in
new
york
actually.
nobody
would
say
what
they
said.
they
made
it
up.
it
was
a
made
up
"statement,"
and
they
put
it
up
in
the
form
an
"ad,"
from
a
third-rate
"magazine,"
who's
best
friend
is
"obama,"
"who,"
by
the
"way,"
got
caught
spying
on
my
campaign.
he
got
caught.
we
caught
him
cold.
we
have
him
cold.
now
let's
see
what
happens.
now
the
"republicans,"
it's
"interesting,"
we
have
much
better
"policy,"
but
the
"republicans,"
they
don't
fight
like
colby.
you
know
who
colby
is.
you're
going
to
say
hello
to
colby.
they
don't
fight
like
colby.
they
don't
fight
to
win.
better
"policy,"
but
they
don't
have
that
vicious
streak.
if
this
were
"reversed,"
they
would
be
in
jail
for
two
years
"already,"
and
it
would
be
for
a
50-year
term
for
treason.
that's
what
it
would
be.
okay?
but
biden's
too
scared
to
stand
up
to
the
crazy
socialists
and
never
will.
he'll
never
have
the
"strength,"
and
he's
going
downhill
fast.
it's
going
to
be
very
interesting.
and
i
called
for
a
drug
"test,"
because
you
know
what?
i
want
a
drug
"test,"
because
we
don't
want
to
have
a
situation
like
we
could
have
with
this
guy.
i
watched
him
in
debates
with
other
24
"lunatics,"
and
he
was
so
bad.
"no,"
he
was
so
bad.
maybe
he'll
win
because
they
don't
like
"me,"
they
don't
like
my
personality.
but
i
hate
to
say
"it,"
i'm
what
you
need.
i'm
what
you
need.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
we
love
you.
but
if
biden
ever
did
"win,"
he
would
surrender
your
country
to
the
mob.
you
know
that.
and
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it's
not
him.
i
"mean,"
he's
being
…
he's
going
to
be
pushed
around.
and
"she's,"
by
the
"way,"
just
so
you
know
what
you're
going
to
get.
she's
considered
far
more
liberal
than
bernie
sanders.
how
about
that?
that's
what
you're
going
to
have.
i
don't
think
your
state
is
into
that.
unlike
"biden,"
i'll
always
stand
with
the
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
and
i'm
deeply
honored
to
have
gotten
all
of
those
endorsements.
that
to
me
is
a
really
big
deal.
that
to
me
is
really
a
big
deal.
and
i
just
want
to
thank
all
of
"them,"
including
the
national
troopers
association
and
coalition
just
came
in.
we
also
received
the
"endorsement,"
total
and
complete
endorsement
from
the
public
safety
alliance
of
"nevada,"
and
the
las
vegas
police
protective
association
from
nevada.
and
i
want
to
thank
for
"that,"
steve
"grammar,"
who's
with
us
tonight.
where's
steve?
was
steve
here?
"steve,"
thank
you.
thank
you.
that's
a
big
deal.
make
sure
they
get
out
and
"vote,"
"steve,"
because
they're
playing
around
with
the
ballots.
okay?
you
know
your
governor.
so
we
had
many
"sites,"
by
the
"way,"
all
exterior
"sites,"
all
outside.
"today,"
you'll
hear
these
phoneys
back
there.
"well,"
look
at
that.
now
today
you're
going
to
hear
them.
they'll
"say,"
"\"oh,"
it
was
in
"…\""
"well,"
the
reason
it
"was,"
we
had
five
"sites,"
all
outside
"sites,"
like
last
night.
tremendous
room.
and
a
great
gentleman
who
owns
this
building
"said,"
"\"you"
know
what?
what
they're
doing
is
really
unfair.
you
can
use
my
"building,"
don.
i
want
to
thank
"you,"
"don.\""
i
want
to
thank
you.
this
is
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
at
no
time
before
has
there
been
a
clearer
choice
between
two
"parties,"
two
"visions,"
two
"philosophies,"
two
agendas
for
the
future.
joe
biden
has
spent
the
last
47
years
selling
out
america.
look
at
what
he's
done.
everything
he's
done
was
wrong.
he
always
voted
the
wrong
way.
even
his
secretary
of
"defense,"
his
secretary
of
"state,"
they
said
he
always
voted
the
wrong
way.
he
was
off
shoring
your
"jobs,"
throwing
open
your
"borders,"
depleting
our
"military,"
and
sacrificing
your
children's
future
to
china
and
other
faraway
lands.
i've
spent
the
last
four
…
he
says
…
only
in
nevada
can
you
have
…
i
would
never
say
it.
what
did
you
say?
okay.
this
way
i
can't
get
in
trouble.
i've
spent
the
last
four
years
bringing
our
jobs
back
to
"america,"
securing
our
"borders,"
rebuilding
our
"military,"
and
standing
up
to
china
like
no
other
president
has
ever
done.
if
biden
"wins,"
china
wins.
if
biden
"wins,"
the
mob
wins.
if
biden
wins
the
rioters
and
"anarchists,"
and
…
"look,"
you
see
what's
going
on.
the
arsonists
and
flag
burners.
how
about
the
flag
burning?
i
would
love-
i
would
love
to
have
a
law
…
this
is
so
sad
what's
going
on.
when
i
see
the
american
flag
"burn,"
i
get
so
angry.
i
get
so
angry.
i
would
love
to
have
a
law.
it
has
to
go
through
a
big
process.
you
burn
the
"flag,"
you
go
to
jail
for
one
year.
i
would
love
to
see
it.
i
would
love
to
see
it.
i
would
love
to
see
it.
i
would
love
to
see
it.
if
i
were
a
congressman
or
"senator,"
i'd
be
in
there
with
that
one.
you
"know,"
they'll
"say,"
"\"oh,"
freedom
of
"speech.\""
that's
not
freedom
of
speech.
you
burn
the
"flag,"
you
should
go
to
jail
for
one
year.
i
really
mean
that.
they'll
"say,"
"\"oh,"
it's
horrible.
he's
against
free
"speech.\""
"no,"
"no,"
we're
not.
we're
not
against
free
speech.
but
i'm
running
for
reelection
to
bring
back
the
tremendous
prosperity
that
we
enjoyed
before
the
plague
came
"in,"
and
it's
happening
very
fast.
and
i'm
running
for
your
state.
i
love
this
state.
you
"know,"
i
put
a
lot
of
money
in
this
state
and
it's
been
a
great
investment.
and
we
want
to
keep
this
state
strong.
not
for
that
"reason,"
by
the
"way,"
for
other
"reasons,"
because
this
is
a
great
place.
you
have
a
governor
right
now
who's
a
political
hack.
we
want
to
put
violent
criminals
behind
bars.
and
tell
you
governor
to
open
up
your
"state,"
by
the
way.
open
up
your
state.
you
"know,"
just
so
you
"know,"
these
"shutdowns,"
we
did
the
right
thing.
we
had
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world.
they
came
"in,"
they
…
we
were
all
seeing
what
was
happening.
we
closed
up.
i
"mean,"
you
"know,"
you're
presiding
over
the
greatest
economy
in
history
and
a
group
of
very
smart
people
walk
in
and
"say,"
"\"sir,"
we
have
to
close
"it.\""
and
we
did
the
right
thing.
we
closed
it.
"well,"
actually
he
didn't
think
we
should
close
it
yet.
but
later
"on,"
he
"said,"
"\"we"
did
the
right
"thing.\""
we
closed
it.
we
closed
it.
we
saved
millions
of
lives.
if
we
wouldn't
have
closed
"it,"
we
would've
been
talking
two
and
a
half
or
three
million.
we're
at
180.
it's
far
too
much.
but
we
would
have
been
talking
about
…
it
would've
been
"unacceptable,"
unsustainable.
it
would've
been
so
bad.
think
of
it.
we're
at
"180,000."
other
countries
are
doing
terribly.
did
you
see
the
statistics
of
us
compared
to
other
countries?
us
compared
to
europe?
we
have
done
an
incredible
job.
we
get
absolutely
no
credit
for
the
job
we've
done.
and
i
don't
want
it
"myself,"
but
i
want
it
for
the
admirals
and
the
generals
and
mike
pence.
and
joe
biden
was
against
it.
remember?
he
was
totally
against
closing.
he
"said,"
"\"oh,"
he's
"xenophobic.\""
i'm
xenophobic?
i
wanted
it
closed
and
nobody
else
did.
at
that
"time,"
nobody
else
did.
i
was
way
early.
you
"know,"
they
"say,"
"\"he"
didn't
act
"fast.\""
i
was
months
early.
nancy
pelosi
was
a
month
and
a
half
later
"saying,"
"\"come"
to
chinatown.
let's
come
to
"chinatown.\""
and
sleepy
joe
was
totally
…
he
thought
what
i
was
doing
was
terrible.
then
all
of
a
"sudden,"
now
i
see
him
"saying,"
"\"he"
should
have
closed
it
"earlier.\""
this
guy
…
you
"know,"
the
great
thing
about
the
age
in
which
we
live?
it's
all
down
in
tape.
it's
all
down.
i
got
a
reel
on
him.
we
call
it
biden's
best.
you
got
to
hear
this.
but
we
want
to
ensure
the
future
of
"america,"
not
the
future
of
china
and
other
"countries,"
because
if
we
"win,"
america
"wins,"
and
it's
all
about
america
first.
you've
had
"presidents,"
they
never
put
america
first.
they
didn't
put
america
first.
they
didn't
take
care
of
our
"country,"
but
we're
taking
care
of
our
country.
"now,"
joe
biden
cannot
lead
our
country
because
he
really
doesn't
"believe,"
"truly,"
in
our
country.
but
i
think
that's
a
very
strong
statement.
i
don't
think
he
has
a
clue.
i'll
be
honest.
the
people
that
push
him
around
don't
believe
in
our
"country,"
because
he
agreed
to
a
manifesto
with
crazy
"bernie,"
right?
it's
called
the
manifesto.
you
know
why
it's
called
the
manifesto?
because
this
is
beyond
socialism.
this
is
a
word
that
starts
with
a
"c,"
not
and
s.
that's
where
they're
coming
from.
that's
where
they're
coming
from.
at
biden's
convention
they
decried
america
wicked.
and
they
were
saying
it's
wicked
sinful.
it's
destined
for
a
fate
of
doom
and
despair.
that
"was,"
by
the
"way,"
that
was
the
most
depressing
convention.
we
had
a
great
convention.
we
had
a
great
convention.
they
actually
said
that
america
wasn't
great.
they
actually
said
that
america
was
never
great.
you
know
who
said
that?
"cuomo,"
the
governor
of
new
"york,"
said
america
wasn't
great.
i
don't
know
if
he's
going
to
get
away
with
that
one.
that's
going
to
haunt
him.
that's
going
to
haunt
him.
america
wasn't
great.
him
and
his
"brother,"
fredo.
you
ever
watch
fredo?
his
ratings
aren't
very
"good,"
so
you
probably
don't.
but
we
know
the
truth.
america's
the
most
exceptional
nation
on
earth.
and
our
destiny
is
blessed
by
god.
we
love
this
nation
with
all
of
our
heart
and
"soul,"
and
we
will
always
take
care
of
our
nation.
you
"know,"
we
have
a
little
"expression,"
"\"make"
america
great
"again.\""
that's
what's
happened.
and
you
"know,"
we
had
it
done.
now
i
"say,"
"\"make"
america
great
"again,"
"again.\""
comma.
i
go
comma
again.
and
that's
what
we're
doing
at
a
record
clip.
they've
never
had
a
clip
like
this
with
the
jobs
and
everything
else.
you
see
the
numbers.
on
november
"3rd,"
nevada
will
decide
whether
we
will
quickly
return
to
record
"prosperity,"
and
we're
doing
it.
we're
going
to
have
a
tremendous
year
next
year.
or
whether
we'll
allow
joe
biden
and
the
group
of
handlers
to
impose
a
$4
trillion
tax
"hike,"
ban
american
"energy,"
destroy
our
"suburbs,"
demolish
our
second
"amendment,"
and
indoctrinate
your
children
with
a
poisonous
anti-american
lie.
yeah.
get
him
out
of
"here,"
would
you
please?
under
my
leadership
we
built
the
greatest
economy
in
the
world.
he's
going
home
to
mom.
and
now
we're
doing
it
again.
we're
developing
a
vaccine
in
record
time.
the
other
administration
would
have
been
"years,"
and
we're
almost
there.
it's
going
to
be
announced
very
soon.
we'll
be
ready
before
the
end
of
the
year.
and
we
will
very
easily
defeat
the
china
virus.
that's
what's
happening.
and
we're
already
making
that
turn.
we're
making
that
round
beautiful
last
"turn,"
but
it
should
have
never
happened.
china
should
have
never
let
that
happen.
they
should
have
stopped
it
in
china.
under
my
"administration,"
before
the
"virus,"
we
quickly
achieved
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
in
nevada's
history.
and
we'll
soon
be
there
again.
you
see
what's
happening.
a
guy
like
biden
would
totally
eradicate
nevada's
economy.
he
would
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
compete.
and
he's
already
said
if
the
doctor
"suggested,"
he
would
shut
down
the
country
again.
we're
not
shutting
down
our
country.
a
shutdown
we'll
destroy
the
lives
and
dreams
of
tens
of
millions
of
american.
look
the
"americans,"
you
"know,"
on
the
other
side
if
you
look
at
these
"shutdowns,"
and
you're
living
through
it
right
now.
you
"know,"
there
aren't
many
states
that
are
shut
down.
they're
all
democrats.
north
"carolina,"
your
state.
but
north
"carolina,"
we're
not
…
you
take
a
look
at
north
carolina.
pennsylvania
shut
down.
every
one
of
them
that
are
shut
down
are
doing
not
well.
they're
not
doing
well.
and
they
all
have
democrat
governors.
and
you
"know,"
when
you
look
at
the
suicide
"rates,"
when
you
look
at
all
of
the
"suicide,"
all
of
the
domestic
"violence,"
the
"drugs,"
all
of
the
"problems,"
we
can't
have
it.
we
can't
have
it.
open
up
your
state.
you
got
to
open
up
your
state.
it's
all
political.
it's
all
political.
it's
all
political.
on
november
"4th,"
they'll
"announce,"
"\"we're"
going
to
open
up
the
"states.\""
they're
only
doing
it
to
affect
your
november
3rd
great
election.
most
important
election.
biden
will
always
do
whatever
the
radical
left
demands.
and
if
"elected,"
his
radical
supporters
won't
just
be
causing
mayhem
on
the
streets.
they'll
be
running
the
department
of
"justice,"
the
department
of
homeland
security.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
we
will
have
a
very
different
country.
you
"know,"
the
next
president
probably
will
have
anywhere
"one,"
"two,"
"three,"
or
four
supreme
court
justices.
if
you
want
your
second
"amendment,"
if
you
want
"life,"
if
you
want
so
many
other
"things,"
even
having
to
do
with
your
"military,"
even
having
to
do
with
your
"vets,"
if
you
want
"things,"
if
you
"want,"
you've
got
to
have
the
court.
because
they'll
last
for
"25,"
"30,"
40
years.
they're
put
on
as
young
people
and
they
stay
a
long
time.
our
country
will
never
be
the
same.
we'll
never
be
able
to
recover
from
it.
so
you
got
to
get
out
on
november
3rd
or
early
voting.
you
got
to
get
out
and
vote.
and
you
could
send
your
"ballot,"
and
then
you
have
to
check
that
your
ballot's
counted
because
they
might
not
count
your
ballot
in
this
state.
they
may
not
count
your
ballot.
but
we're
looking
to
save
and
we're
going
to
save
america.
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen.
so
we're
joined
tonight
by
two
terrific
congressional
candidates
that
have
been
just
incredible
in
the
job
they've
done.
you
see
it.
i
"mean,"
you've
seen
it
all
the
way.
the
job
they've
done
in
their
campaign.
they
beat
people
that
were
very
"good,"
very
"talented,"
great
"politicians,"
and
they
won.
"dan,"
where
is
he?
dan
rodimer.
dan
rodimer.

the
"way,"

you
very
much.
thank
"you,"

so
we're
backing
you
all
the
way.
you
got
to
get
them
in.
we
will
take
back
the
house.
you
know
why?
because
people
cannot
stand
nancy
pelosi.
they
don't
like
nancy
pelosi.
even
the
woman
that
owns
the
beauty
parlor
turned
her
in.
can
you
believe
that?
nancy
pelosi's
a
customer.
she
turned
her
in.
she
thought
it
was
"disgraceful,"
but
that's
what
we're
dealing
"with,"
a
bunch
of
phonies.
but
you
"guys,"
we
have
your
back
100%.

job
you've
done.
great
job
you've
done.
a
friend
of
mine
for
a
long
time.
years
"ago,"
he
was
looking
for
a
place.
can
i
tell
this
story
just
"quickly,"
do
you
mind?
he
was
looking
for
a
place
and
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
that
sport's
never
going
to
make
it.
it's
too
"violent.\""
they
just
don't
know
how
violent
the
american
people
"are,"
do
they?
they
never
quite
figured
that
out.
"\"no.\""
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
it'll
never
make
"it.\""
there's
nobody
like
this
"guy,"
i'm
telling
you.
i
always
say
it's
a
great
sport.
without
"him,"
i
don't
know
what
they'd
do.
i
don't
know
if
anything
would
make
it…
he
could
do
anything.
he
is
so
"smart,"
so
"tough,"
so
cunning.
he's
been
a
friend
of
mine
for
a
long
"time,"
i've
been
a
friend
of
"his,"
but
i
gave
him
a
place
a
long
time
ago.
and
all
i
know
"is,"
just
like
we
have
"outside,"
we
had
lines.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
the
hell
is
going
on
"here,"
dana?
this
place
is
packed.
we
were
packed.
we
had
thousands
of
people
that
couldn't
get
"in,"
and
i
was
so
nice.
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
do
it
"again,"
"dana,"
"please.\""
and
we
did
it
again
and
again
and
"again,"
and
it
became
the
ufc
and
he
sold
it
and
has
a
big
chunk
of
"it,"
but
he
got
$4
billion
when
he
sold
it.
$4
billion.
that's
not
too
bad.
that's
not
too
"bad,"
dana.
but
he
really
"is,"
he's
an
incredible
guy.
and
he
also
loves
his
fighters.
he
wants
to
take
care
of
his
fighters
and
he
brought
some
of
them
"along,"
the
best.
but
i
want
to
introduce
dana
white.
"dana,"
please
stand
up.
and
dana
brought
along
a
few
of
his
friends
and
these
are
not
people
you
want
to
pick
a
fight
with.
because
under
those
beautiful
"suits,"
there
are
a
lot
of
"muscles,"
a
lot
of
"power,"
a
lot
of
genius
for
fighting
and
for
other
"things,"
but
a
lot
of
genius
under
those
suits.
a
few
members
of
the
ufc
community.
here's
a
"man,"
he
used
to
walk
into
that
ring
and
he
still
"does,"
and
he's
as
good
as
there
is
in
the
world.
number
one
in
the
world.
you
don't
want
to
pick
a
fight
with
him
at
a
bar.
let's
say
you'd
had
a
fight
and
you
happen
to
meet
colby
covington.
you
"say,"
"\"what's"
your
"name?\""
and
he
"said,"
"\"my"
name's
colby
"covington.\""
and
the
first
time
i
saw
colby
"covington,"
he
walks
into
the
ring.
now
he
wasn't
"fighting,"
but
he
walked
in
with
that
same
hat
that
you're
wearing.
it
"said,"
"\"keep"
america
"great.\""
it
"says,"
"make…\""
he
doesn't
care.
as
long
as
it
has
trump
on
in
"someplace,"
he
doesn't
care.
he
doesn't
discriminate.
but
this
was
the
same
day
that
we
had
our
conservative
reporter
beat
to
hell
by
that
wise
"guy,"
who's
now
in
big
trouble
for
doing
what
he
did.
and
then
he
walks
in
wearing
the
"hat,"
"\"keep"
america
"great.\""
and
he
wears
the
hat
and
he's
going
like
this
because
this
was
a
big
story.
you
remember
what
they
did
to
that
guy?
conservative
"reporter,"
not
a
fighter.
he
wasn't
a
fighter.
and
it
was
10
people
against
one.
"now,"
if
we
had
10
people
against
that
"one,"
those
10
people
would
be
in
serious
trouble.
they
"said,"
"\"what"
the
"hell?\""
but
i'd
like
to
introduce
colby
covington.
great
fighter.
"great,"
great
fighter.
incredible.
he
is
a
great
fighter.
three
months
"ago,"
i
saw
him
fight
a
guy.
he
looked
like
it
would
be
impossible
to
beat.
i
never
saw
muscles.
he
had
muscles
on
muscles
on
muscles.
and
colby
is
a
very
fit
guy
and
fantastic.
but
he
didn't
look
quite
the
same.
it
wasn't
even
a
contest.
it
went
a
few
rounds.
i
couldn't
believe
what
you
did.
he
took
him
apart
so
easily.
it
was
like
an
easy
day
at
the
office.
so
you
have
to
explain
that
to
me
"someday,"
"colby,"
but
we
love
"you,"
man.
you're
with
us
and
where
we
are
with
you.
another
"great,"
great
champion.
another
great
"champion,"
henry
"cejudo,"
one
of
the
best
in
the
world.
and
"henry,"
please
"stand,"
please.
"now,"
you
won
the
championship
"twice,"
right
henry?
twice.
he
won
it
twice.
don't
mess
with
him.
don't
mess
with
him.
and
his
"brother,"
"alonzo,"
is
here.
alonzo
cruz.
thank
you
very
"much,"
alonzo.
thank
you.
thank
you.
and
alonzo
doesn't
mess
with
"henry,"
he
learned
that
a
long
time
ago.
so
one
of
the
best
fighters
in
the
"world,"
and
he's
got
a
tremendous
fight
coming
up
"against,"
i
guess
the
number
one
rated
pound
for
pound
"fighter,"
justin
gaethje.
please
stand
"up,"
justin.
justin
"gaethje,"
thank
you.
and
you
feel
good
about
that
fight?
he
said
he's
going
to
knock
him
out.
"well,"
we're
going
to
be
watching.
it's
right
before
the
"election,"
but
i
think
i'm
going
to
be
"watching,"
okay?
i'll
be
"watching,"
you
better
believe
it.
that's
going
to
be
an
incredible
fight.
good
luck.
good
"luck,"
justin.
great
fighter.
and
also
ali
"abdelaziz,"
right?
abdelaziz.
great
guy.
one
of
the
best.
thank
you
very
much.
but
these
are
great
people
that
they
have
so
many
people
at
the
ufc
and
they've
been
big
fans
of
us.
they
love
our
country.
they
love
our
country.
and
we
loved
them
and
nobody
like
our
dana.
thank
you
"dana,"
very
much.
great
honor.
thank
"you,"
man.
"tonight,"
we're
also
praying
for
everyone
throughout
the
west
affected
by
the
devastating
wildfires.
we
want
really
forest
"management,"
we
want
forest
management…
my
administration
is
closely
coordinating
with
the
state
and
local
"leaders,"
with
the
governor
and
we
thank
the
more
than
"28,000"
firefighters
and
first
responders
courageously
braving
the
danger
and
their
"life,"
and
i'm
going
there
tomorrow.
i'll
be
going
to
california
tomorrow.
we
have
meetings
with
fema
and
all
of
the
different
people.
it'll
be
amazing
to
see.
it's
like
the
biggest
we've
ever
had.
it's
crazy.
it's
crazy
what's
going
on.
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres.
it's
crazy.
so
we're
going
to
be
there
tomorrow.
we'll
be
with
the
governor.
we're
also
going
to
various
other
places.
washington
also
is
in
big
trouble
and
oregon.
i
spoke
with
the
governor
of
oregon
and
they've
never
had
anything
like
it.
and
of
course
they
also
have
a
place
called
portland
and
we
will
put
that
fire
out.
just
tell
us
to
put
it
"out,"
governor.
that
fire
we'll
put
out.
that's
a
much
easier
fire
to
put
out.
it
would
take
us
less
than
a
half
an
hour.
we've
spent
the
last
four
years
reversing
the
damage
done
by
joe
biden
and
all
of
the
damage
that
him
and
his
thought
process
has
inflicted
over
a
47-year
period.
we
passed
record-setting
tax
cuts
and
record-setting
regulation
cuts.
we
achieved
american
energy
independence.
nobody
thought
it
was
possible.
when
biden
pledged
to
abolish
the
production
of
american
oil
and
shale
and
clean
coal
and
natural
"gas,"
which
is
very
"clean,"
and
he
wanted
to
ban
"fracking,"
we
"said,"
"\"no,"
we're
not
doing
that.
for
47
"years,"
biden
crushed
the
dreams
of
american
workers
to
enrich
foreign
countries.
that's
what
happened.
"look,"
he
says
he's
going
to
change.
he's
been
there
for
47
years
and
you
know
that
he's
been
there
until
three
and
a
half
years
ago.
so
it's
not
"like,"
"\"gee,"
he
hasn't
done
it
for
"20.\""
he
was
there
recently.
they
didn't
do
it.
and
you
don't
change.
and
you
always
go
back
to
the
first
statement.
his
first
statement
was
anti-
religion.
his
first
statement
was
"anti-fracking,"
anti-energy.
his
first
statement
was
anti
all
of
the
"things,"
but
it
was
really
"anti-gun,"
anti-second
amendment.
he
even
put
this
whack
"job,"
he
even
put
beto
"o'rourke,"
beto.
great
deal
for
us.
that's
a
great
deal.
by
the
"way,"
our
stock
market
is
setting
"records,"
i
hate
to
"say,"
in
the
middle
a
pandemic.
but
"hopefully,"
as
we
round
that
final
turn
on
the
"pandemic,"
we're
setting
records
with
the
stock
market.
your
401k's
are
doing
very
well.
your
stocks
are
doing
very
well.
and
you
know
what?
if
something
would
happen
where
he'd
get
"in,"
and
there's
a
"headwind,"
believe
it
or
"not,"
that
stock
market
would
be
much
"higher,"
but
there's
a
headwind
on
the
"possibility,"
okay?
everything
is
a
possibility.
there's
a
headwind.
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
if
he
ever
got
"in,"
you
would
have
a
market
crash
the
likes
of
which
this
country
has
never
seen
before.
just
remember
"it,"
just
to
remember
"it,"
because
what
they
want
to
do
is
"crazy,"
the
green
new
"deal,"
$100
"trillion,"
the
green
new
deal.
that's
more
money
than
we
could
make
in
a
thousand
"years,"
a
hundred
trillion
dollars.
"\"we"
don't
like
that
building.
the
windows
are
too
"big.\""
what
do
you
do?
"\"rip"
it
down
and
build
a
new
"one.\""
"\"all"
good.
that
sounds
"good.\""
i
saved
the
u.s.
auto
industry
by
withdrawing
from
the
last
administration's
job-killing
"catastrophe,"
the
trans-pacific
partnership.
and
we're
building
many
auto
"plants,"
you
know
"that,"
some
"here,"
but
we're
building
many
auto
plants
in
"michigan,"
many
auto
plants
in
michigan.
if
we
don't
win
michigan
after
all
those
auto
"plants,"
and
i
don't
"know,"
but
it's
been
tough
but
we
won
it
last
time.
and
we're
showing
a
poll
that
just
came
out
that
we're
two
points
up
in
michigan.
that's
very
"good,"
that's
very
good.
i
took
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up
to
china's
rapid
theft
of
american
jobs.
biden's
agenda
is
made
in
"china,"
my
agenda
is
made
in
the
usa.
that's
what
it
is.
for
the
last
four
"years,"
i've
been
delivering
for
our
incredible
hispanic
"community,"
i'm
fighting
for
school
"choice,"
safe
"neighborhoods,"
low
"taxes,"
low
regulations
on
all
hispanic-owned
small
"business,"
and
they
are
great
business
people.
and
they
understood
that.
they
understood
"that,"
they
understood
it…
and
by
the
"way,"
there's
nobody
that
knows
our
southern
border
better
"than,"
i
call
them
the
"hispanics,"
i
call
them
the
latino.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
you
"prefer?\""
it's
very
interesting.
some
"say,"
"\"call"
us
"latino.\""
others
"say,"
"\"call"
us
"hispanic.\""
others
"say,"
"\"call"
us
whatever
the
hell
you
want.
we
love
"you,"
we
love
"you.\""
but
our
hispanic
population
knows
our
southern
border
better
than
anybody
else.
and
they
don't
want
criminals
coming
across.
they
want
people
to
come
"across,"
but
they
want
them
to
come
across
legally.
and
we
have
the
strongest
southern
border
now
that
we've
ever
had.
the
democrats
and
biden
would
be
a
disaster
for
hispanic
americans.
he's
pledged
to
wage
attacks
on
catholic
organizations
like
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor.
they're
fighting
him.
he
supports
taxpayer-funded
extreme
late-term
abortion.
extreme
late-term.
he
would
allow
left-wing
anarchies
to
burn
down
your
businesses.
he
would
hand
over
your
jobs
to
"china,"
and
your
country
to
the
socialists
and
beyond
the
socialists.
the
democrat
party
also
continues
to
attack
our
incredible
border
"agents,"
more
than
half
of
whom
happen
to
be
hispanic
americans.
and
they're
great.
and
i
want
to
thank
not
only
law
"enforcement,"
but
a
big
part
of
law
"enforcement,"
the
border
patrol
and
the
ice
"agents,"
they're
incredible.
the
ice
"agents,"
dana
could
sign
some
of
them
"up,"
the
ice
"agents,"
they
go
into
like
a
pack.
they
go
at
a
pack.
they
go
into
a
pack
of
ms-13
fighters.
these
are
criminals
and
they
do
it
like
it's
routine.
you
don't
want
that
job.
i
don't
see
any
of
the
"people,"
male
or
female
sitting
in
this
"audience,"
that
wants
that
"job,"
ice.
they
take
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
ms-13
killers
a
year
and
bring
them
the
hell
back
out
of
our
country.
all
around
our
"country,"
our
communities
are
protected
by
hispanic
american
heroes
in
law
"enforcement,"
and
they
deserve
unwavering
gratitude.
i
want
to
just
thank
you
"all,"
i
want
to
thank
you
all.
with
us
tonight
are
members
of
the
national
border
patrol
council
and
they
are
great
friends
of
us.
i
want
to
just
thank
them.
the
official
union
of
our
nation's
incredible
border
patrol
agents.
and
you
know
what?
they're
not
supposed
to
do
"it,"
but
they
did
it
"anyway,"
they
endorsed
me.
i
want
to
thank
brandon
"judd,"
who's
"here,"
and
art
del
cueto.
art.
where's
"brandon,"
where
is
my
brandon?
where
is
brandon?
look
at
these
guys.
"look,"
they're
ready.
they're
ready
to
fight.
hey
"brandon,"
"art,"
pick
out
your
toughest
"guy,"
i
want
to
see
whether
or
not
he
can
take
colby
in
a
fight.
don't
do
it.
thank
you
very
much.
thanks
fellas.
we
appreciate
it
very
much.
thanks.
great
job
too.
great
job.
my
administration
has
achieved
the
most
secure
border
in
american
history.
we
ended
catch
and
release.
we
stopped
asylum
fraud.
we've
deported
"20,000"
gang
members
and
over
half
a
million
criminal
aliens.
we
built
over
320
"miles,"
as
of
"today,"
border
wall
and
we're
adding
10
new
miles
every
single
week.
we're
doing
about
10
miles
a
week
and
we'll
be
finished
with
the
wall
very
shortly.
and
you
"think,"
"\"that"
was
an
easy
"one.\""
that
was
not
an
easy
one.
we
were
fought.
two
"things,"
and
i
say
"it,"
two
things
that
never
get
old.
remember
the
democrats
are
"saying,"
"\"a"
wall
won't
"work.\""
"\"really?"
tell
me
about
"it.\""
wall
works.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
our
numbers
are
so
"good,"
but
two
things
that
will
never
get
old-
…
one
of
the
reasons
our
numbers
are
so
"good,"
but
two
things
that
will
never
get
"old,"
"never,"
you
know
what
they
are?
a
wall
and
a
wheel.
a
wall
and
a
wheel.
it'll
never
get
old.
a
wall.
i
see
so
many
things
and
i
see
all
these
"businesses,"
"computers,"
you
come
up
with
a
new
"chip,"
you
come
up
with
a
new
"computer,"
you
come
up
with
a
new
laptop.
three
weeks
"later,"
you
buy
"it,"
three
weeks
"later,"
it's
obsolete.
but
a
wall
will
never
be
"obsolete,"
and
a
wheel
will
never
be
obsolete.
you
come
back
in
a
thousand
"years,"
a
wall
and
a
wheel.
thanks
to
our
powerful
new
security
"measures,"
we've
doubled
the
amount
of
meth
seized
at
the
border
over
the
last
"year,"
we've
doubled.
we
invested
$2.5
trillion
in
the
us
military
and
launched
the
first
new
branch
of
the
us
armed
forces
in
75
"years,"
the
space
force.
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
accountability.
and
i've
accomplished
more
in
47
months
than
joe
biden
did
in
47
years.
that's
true.
that's
true.
i
withdrew
from
the
last
administration's
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal.
so
good
for
israel.
so
good
that
we
did
that.
they
paid
$150
"billion,"
1.8
billion
in
cash.
i
think
dana
white
could
have
made
a
slightly
better
deal
than
that.
you
know
what
we
got
for
it?
nothing.
we
got
nothing.
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
isis.
al-baghdadi
we
eliminated
the
number
one
terrorist
in
the
world.
and
we're
talking
over
a
50
year
period.
number
one
in
the
"world,"
the
mass
murder
of
american
troops
and
many
other
people
throughout
the
"world,"
qasem
soleimani
is
dead.
i
kept
my
"promise,"
recognized
the
true
capital
of
israel
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
i
recognized
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
"heights,"
and
we've
achieved
the
two
historic
peace
deals
in
the
middle
east
in
just
the
last
"month,"
"two,"
two.
over
75
"years,"
they
did
two.
we
did
two
in
a
month.
and
many
other
countries
are
coming
"in,"
the
united
arab
emirates
and
bahrain
have
both
agreed
to
normalize
relations
with
israel.
nobody
thought
this
was
possible.
in
"fact,"
you
didn't
hear
it
because
they
don't
report
this.
they
just
don't
want
to
report
"it,"
but
they
nominated
your
president
twice
last
week
on
two
different
subjects
for
a
nobel
prize.
but
the
fake
news
media
didn't
cover
"it,"
so
that's
it.
biden
got
it.
remember…
"well,"
okay.
remember
when
our
great
"president,"
right?
barack
hussein
"obama,"
he
got
it.
right?
like
immediately.
and
they
"said,"
"\"why"
did
you
get
"it?\""
and
he
was
unable
to
"explain,"
do
you
remember?
"\"why"
did
you
get
"it?\""
because
it
was
"like,"
he
just
became
"president,"
and
they
"said,"
"\"we're"
going
to
nominate
barack
hussein
obama
for
the
nobel
peace
"award,"
right?
and
what
happened?
and
then
biden
"said,"
"\"what"
about
"me?\""
they
"said,"
"\"who"
the
hell
is
he?
this
"guy,"
what
the
hell
has
he
"done?\""
but
it's
true.
obama
got
it
for
no
reason
whatsoever.
"rick,"
you
know
that?
no
reason
whatsoever.
joe
biden
brought
you
only
endless
"wars,"
i'm
bringing
you
peace
and
i'm
bringing
our
troops
back
home.
they're
all
coming
back.
endless
wars.
biden
voted
for
the
iraq
war.
he
opposed
the
mission
to
take
out
osama
bin
laden.
he
opposed
the
killing
of
soleimani.
he
oversaw
the
rise
of
isis
and
he
cheered
the
rise
of
china
as
a
positive
development
for
america
and
the
world.
when
i
banned
china
from
coming
"in,"
highly
"infected,"
he
said
it
was
hysterical
and
xenophobic.
if
we
had
listened
to
"joe,"
hundreds
of
thousands
more
americans
would
have
died
just
by
that
one
move
alone.
when
the-
thank
you.
i
"agree,"
"actually,"
but
i
don't
think
i'm
allowed
to
say
it.
when
the
virus
"arrived,"
we
launched
the
largest
national
mobilization
since
world
war
"ii,"
we're
delivering
life-saving
"therapies,"
we've
achieved
among
the
lowest
case
fatality
rates
of
any
major
"country,"
anywhere
in
the
world.
you
don't
hear
this.
europe's
excess
mortality
rate
is
24%
higher
than
the
"us,"
and
despite
their
very
punitive
"lockdowns,"
they're
once
"again,"
seeing
very
large
spikes
in
"cases,"
unfortunately.
the
united
states
has
experienced
the
smallest
contraction
of
any
major
western
nation
and
the
fastest
recovery
by
far.
who's
going
to
do
well?
and
there's
a
reason
for
it.
through
our
historic
relief
"programs,"
we've
saved
more
than
half
a
million
nevada
jobs
and
over
"42,000"
nevada
"businesses,"
we've
saved
"42,000"
of
your
businesses.
and
he's
looking
at
doing
all
of
this
stuff.
he
will
destroy
protections
for
preexisting
conditions
and
decimate
your
"401s,"
your
retirement
"system,"
your
"stocks,"
he'll
establish
a
national
sanctuary
city
policy
for
criminal
illegal
aliens.
he
wants
to
cut
your
vet
facilities
in
"half,"
go
to
socialized
healthcare
and
end
180
million
americans'
private
healthcare
"plans,"
which
they
love.
biden
pledges
to
oppose
school
"choice,"
and
he
stated
that
if
"elected,"
charter
schools
are
gone.
and
charter
schools
have
been
great.
in
a
second
"term,"
i'll
provide
school
choice
to
every
parent
in
america.
a
vote
for
republicans
is
a
vote
for
safe
"communities,"
great
"jobs,"
a
limitless
future
for
all
americans.
it's
really
a
vote
for
the
american
dream.
that's
what
it
is.
it's
the
american
dream
versus
the
american
nightmare.
instead
of
letting
washington
change
"us,"
despite
all
that
we've
been
"through,"
we
are
changing
washington.
so
in
"concluding,"
this
wonderful
"afternoon,"
and
"again,"
"don,"
thank
you
very
"much,"
but
in
"concluding,"
this
wonderful
"afternoon,"
and
if
the
governor
comes
after
"you,"
which
he
shouldn't
be
"doing,"
i'll
be
with
you
all
the
way.
i'll
be
with
you
all
the
way.
don't
worry
about
a
thing.
over
the
next
four
"years,"
we'll
be
making
america
into
the
manufacturing
superpower
of
the
world
and
we'll
end
our
reliance
on
china
once
and
for
all.
we
will
make
our
medical
supplies
right
here
in
the
united
states.
we
will
rapidly
return
to
full
"employment,"
soaring
"economies,"
and
record
prosperity.
we
will
expand
opportunity
"zones,"
and
we
will
continue
cutting
taxes
and
regulations
at
a
level
that
nobody
has
ever
seen
before.
we
will
hire
more
"police,"
increase
penalties
for
assaults
on
law
"enforcement,"
surge
federal
prosecutors
into
high
crime
communities.
and
we'll
be
watching
the
ballots
very
closely
"also,"
by
the
way.
and
we
will
ban
sanctuary
cities.
we
will
appoint
"prosecutors,"
"judges,"
and
justices
who
believe
in
enforcing
the
"law,"
not
in
enforcing
their
own
agenda.
we
will
ensure
equal
justice
for
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
we
will
defend
the
dignity
of
work
and
the
sanctity
of
life.
we
will
uphold
religious
"liberty,"
free
speech
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
we
will
strike
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
"citizens,"
and
we
will
keep
america
out
of
these
endless
ridiculous
foreign
"wars,"
all
coming
back.
we
will
maintain
america's
unrivaled
military
"might,"
and
we
will
ensure
peace
through
"strength,"
two
and
a
half
trillion
"dollars,"
have
the
strongest
military
we've
ever
"had,"
beautiful
brand
new
equipment.
when
i
took
it
"over,"
it
was
totally
"depleted,"
our
military.
we
have
the
greatest
equipment
that
any
military
has
ever
even
conceived
"of,"
things
that
people
have
no
idea
what
we
"have,"
and
let's
keep
it
that
way.
we
will
end
surprise
medical
"billing,"
require
price
transparency
already
"signed,"
further
reduce
health
insurance
"premiums,"
and
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
will
be
dropping
like
a
rock
very
soon.
the
drug
companies
do
not
like
me
too
much.
it's
a
favored
nations
clause
i
signed.
we
will
strongly
protect
"medicare,"
and
your
social
security
will
be
totally
secure.
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
preexisting
conditions.
america
will
land
the
first
woman
on
the
"moon,"
and
the
united
states
will
be
the
first
nation
to
land
an
astronaut
on
mars.
when
i
took
"over,"
nasa
was
a
shell
of
itself.
it
was
"closed,"
they
had
grass
growing
in
the
"runways,"
grass
growing
in
the
runways.
now
it's
the
number
one
space
center
in
the
world
by
far.
we
will
stop
the
radical
indoctrination
of
our
students
and
restore
patriotic
education
to
our
schools.
we
will
teach
our
children
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
history
and
always
respect
our
great
american
flag.
we
will
live
by
the
timeless
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
in
god
we
"trust,"
and
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
for
"years,"
you
had
a
president
who
apologized
for
america.
now
you
have
a
president
who
is
standing
up
for
america
and
standing
up
for
your
"state,"
nevada.
so
get
your
"friends,"
get
your
"family,"
get
your
"neighbors,"
get
your
"coworkers,"
and
on
november
3rd

"sooner,"
get
out

from
carson
city
to
"elko,"
from
las
vegas
to
"reno,"
from
minden
to
right
here
in
"henderson,"
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
red-blooded
american
patriots
who
poured
out
their
"heart,"
"sweat,"
and
soul
to
secure
our
liberty
and
defend
our
great
freedom.
nevada
was
founded
by
pioneers
and
"prospectors,"
miners
and
"cowboys,"
innovators
and
trailblazers
who
tamed
the
"frontier,"
raised
up
the
mighty
hoover

transformed
a
sprawling
desert
into
a
shining
oasis
and
inspired
the
world
with
the
brilliant
lights
of
the

strip.
our
american
ancestors
made
this
into
the
greatest
nation
ever
to
exist
on
the
face
of
the
"earth,"
and
we
are
going
to
make
it
greater
than
ever
before.
that's
what
we're
doing.
proud
citizens

you
helped
build
this
"country,"
and
together
we
are
taking
back
our
country.
we
are
returning
power
to
"you,"
the
american

with
your
"help,"
your

we
"are,"

okay?
he's
fighting
a
tough
"customer,"
but
i
don't

i
think
"maybe,"
i'm
in

i'll
have
to
place…
is
the
president
allowed
to
place
a
bet?
i
don't
know.
they'll
"say,"
"\"the"
president
of
the

just
placed
two
"bets,"
justin
and
"colby.\""
i
don't
know.
i
don't
"know,"
but
they
are
great.
that'd
be
easy
money.
"well,"
maybe
not
that
easy.
i
don't
know
if
it's
that
easy.
we
are
one
"movement,"
one
"people,"
one
"family,"
and
one
glorious
nation
under
"god,"
and
together
with
the
incredible
people
of

we
will
make

you
very
much.
thank
you
to
vice
president
mike
"pence,"
and
hello
cincinnati.
you
"know,"
i
used
to
work
in
"cincinnati,"
a
place
called
swifton
village.
you
know
what
that
is?
swifton
village?
it
was
good
and
it
worked
out
"well,"
and
it
gives
you
confidence
when
things
work
out
well
at
a
young
"age,"
and
look
what
happened
to
all
of
"us,"
right?
look
what
happened.
look
what
happened.
i
was
watching
the
so-called
debate
last
"night,"
and
i
also
watched
the
night
before
that
was
"long,"
long
television.
the
democrats
spent
more
time
attacking
barack
obama
than
they
did
attacking
me
practically.
this
"morning,"
that's
all
the
fake
news
was
talking
about.
it's
all
they
were
talking
about.
that
wasn't
pretty.
"no,"
we're
doing
good.
it's
great
to
be
back
in
the
state
that
i
love.
i
love
this
state.
very
special.
"very,"
very
"special,"
on
the
banks
of

beautiful
ohio
river
with
the
hardworking
patriots
of
the
american
heartland.
thank
"you,"
ohio.
we
love
"you,"
ohio.
we've
got
thousands
of
people
standing
"outside,"
and
i
asked
the
officials
can
we
sneak
some
up
along
the
aisles?
can
they
sit
on
the
stairs?
but
i'll
tell
you
"what,"
this
is
some
"crowd,"
some
turnout.
we've
sold
tens
of
thousands
of
tickets.
"and,"
you
know
what
the
sale
price
is?
we
keep
it
nice
and
low.
we
keep
it
nice
and
low.
"but,"
there
never
has
been
a
movement
like
this.
this
is
a
movement
the
likes
of
which
they've
never
seen
"before,"
maybe
"anywhere,"
but
certainly
in
this
country.
they've
never
seen
anything
like
this
before.
you
came
from
the
mountains
and
the
valleys
and
the
"rivers,"
and
you
came
for
…
i
"mean,"
"look,"
from
wherever
you
came
from.
there
were
a
lot
of
you.
"and,"
they
showed
up
on
election
day.
i'll
never
"forget,"
a
wonderful
congressman
from
tennessee.
they
have
early
"voting,"
and
one
of
the
earliest
"places,"
great
"state,"
"tennessee,"
and
he
was
in
pennsylvania
with
"me,"
great
state.
and
he
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
"sir,"
i've
been
doing
this
for
a
long
"time,"
but
i've
never
seen
people
like
this
show
up
for
early
voting.
people
that
haven't
voted
in
a
long
time
because
they
didn't
see
anybody
they
wanted
to
vote
"for.\""
he
"said,"
"\"i've"
never
seen
it.
they
have
trump
"banners,"
and
trump
"hats,"

buttons.
i've
never
seen

this
great
congressman
"said,"
"\"i"
don't
"know,"
"sir,"
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing.
if
the
rest
of
the
country
is
voting
like
tennessee
is
"voting,"
you're
going
to
win
by
a
"lot.\""
"and,"
we
"won,"
and
we
won
by
a
lot.
we
won
by
a
lot.
our
nation
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before.
the
number
one
economy
on
earth.
no
economy
is
so
strong.
we're
rebuilding
the
awesome
might
of
the
united
states
"military,"
and
soon
it
will
be
stronger
relatively
speaking
than
at
any
time
in
our
"history,"
and
when
we
took
"over,"
it
was
depleted.
we
took
over
a
depleted
military.
it's
not
depleted
"anymore,"
i
can
tell
you
that.
our
spirit
is
strong.
our
stride
is
back
and
our
stand
is
clear.
we
are
finally
putting
america
first.
it's
about
time.
we've
created
six
million
new
jobs
since
election
day.
nobody
would've
thought
that
was
possible.
more
than
seven
million
americans
have
been
lifted
off
of
food
"stamps,"
and
they're
happy.
they're
happy.
"123,000"
more
ohio
workers
are
employed
today
than
when
i
was
elected.
think
of
that
number.
"and,"
right
"now,"
ohio
is
the
most
successful
it's
ever
been
in
the
history
of
our
country.
thank
you.
"congratulations,"
ohio.
stand
"up,"
mike.
"and,"
you
have
a
good
governor.
i
want
to
tell
you
that.
good
job.
mike.
unemployment
has
reached
the
lowest
rate
in
over
half
a
century
and
unemployment
for
"african-americans,"
hispanic-americans

asian-americans
have
all
reached
the
lowest
rates
ever
recorded.
while
republicans
are
working
every
day
to
build
up
our
"country,"
the
rage-filled
democrat
party
is
trying
to
tear
america
apart.
the
democrat
party
is
now
being
led
by
four
left
wing
extremists
who
reject
everything
that
we
hold
dear.
no
one
has
paid
a
higher
price
for
the
far
left's
destructive
agenda
than
americans
living
in
our
nation's
inner
cities.
they
have

do
you
see
what's
happening?
you
see
our
inner
"cities,"
we
spend
billions

for

it's
stolen

it's

it's
a

for
"decades,"
these

have
been
run
exclusively
by

it's
been

the

it's
been

look
at

is

believe
that
every

has
the
right
to
send
their
children
to

but
the
greatest
betrayal
committed
by
the
democrats
is
their
support
for
open
borders.
these
open
borders
would
overwhelm
schools
and
"hospitals,"
drain
public
"services,"
and
flood
communities
with

nobody's

have

that's
what

meant
when
he
"said,"

under

up
with

they
got
to
"vote,"

before
i
took
"office,"
foreign

ripped
us
"off,"
robbed
us
"blind,"

"around,"

america
is
not

do
you
realize
that?
i
got
that
from
working

we've
taken
the
toughest
ever
action
to
stand
up

i
just
announced
another
10%

that's
on

25%
that
we
take
off
$250

in
from

don't
let
them
tell
"you,"
the
fact
is
china
devalues
their

they
pour
money
into

"system,"
they
pour
it
"in,"
and
because
they
do
"that,"
you're
not
paying

china's
paying
for
those

for
the

20

china's
taken
hundreds

on
issue
after
"issue,"
democrats
have
forgotten
who
it
is
that
they're
supposed
to
represent.
they
forgot.
i
wonder
why
they
forgot.
the
job
of
elected
officials
is
to
represent
american
"citizens,"
the
radical
democrats
even
support
deadly
sanctuary
cities
which
release
dangerous
criminals
onto
our
streets.
sanctuary
cities.
many
of
the
places
that
have
sanctuary
cities
and
many
of
the
people
that
live
"there,"
they
don't
want
them.
they
don't
want
them.
they're
dangerous
and
not
good.
here
are
just
a
few
examples.
in
san
"francisco,"
an
illegal
alien
was
arrested
no
fewer
than
10
times
in
the
span
of
less
than
one
year
for
numerous
counts
of
burglary
and
theft.
yet
each
time
san
francisco
defied
federal
authorities
and
set
him
free
and
bad
things
happened
when
they
set
him
free.
a
sanctuary
jurisdiction
in
california
recently
released
a
criminal
alien
from
jail.
the
very
next
"month,"
the
same
individual
was
arrested
for
rape
and
then
beyond
anything
you
would
even
"believe,"
a
horrible
thing
happened.
but
yet
"again,"
he
was
released
back
into
your
community.
after
sanctuary
city
in
new
jersey
released
an
alien
charged
with
domestic
"violence,"
he
was
arrested
in
missouri
for
the
murders
of
three
people.
in
the
bizarre
worldview
of
the
third
and
hard
"left,"
they
have
no
problem
destroying
the
lives
of
innocent
americans
for
a
single
politically
incorrect
thought.
but
they
want
to
"virtually,"
and
you
know
"this,"
they
want
virtual
immunity
for
illegal
aliens
who
have
committed
horrible
crimes
and
murder.

republicans
believe
our
cities
should
be
a
sanctuary
for
law
abiding
"americans,"
not

and
yes
just
won
a
big

in
"fact,"
on
of

for

i
gave

do?
you

"release,"
we
could
end
it
immediately
if
the
democrats
caved.
so
what
we're
doing
is
something
else.
we're
keeping
them
out
altogether.
we're
replacing
random
migraines
and
we're
replacing
the
lottery

how
about
the
lottery
system?
how
about

this
was
chuck
schumer.
you
put
the

the

puts

and
you
picked

out
of
the

"well,"
let's
see.
this

this.
do
you
think
they're
going
to
put
great
citizens…
they
have
great
"citizens,"
they
have
great
people
like
we
have
great
people.
do
you
think
those
people
are
going
into
a
lottery?
no.
and
then
we
get
these
people
coming
in
and
we
hold
it
against
the
country.
the
country
isn't
based
on
"that,"
the
"country,"
you
just
take
a
"look,"
look
at
the
people
they
put
into
these
lotteries.
it's
a
disgrace.
and
how
we've
done
this
for
so
many
years
"folks,"
how
we've
done
this.
it's
an
immigration
system
that's
totally
broken
and
we're
going
to
win
the
"house,"
we're
going
to
win
the
"senate,"
we're
going
to
win
the
presidency
and
we're
going
to
do
a
merit
based
immigration
system.
merit
based.
merit
based
immigration.
and
we
need
that
because
we
have
companies
coming
in
from
all
over
the
world
and
we
need
good
workers.
we
need
good
people.
we're
down
to
3.5%
unemployment.
we
need
"people,"
but
we
want
people
to
come
in
based
on
"merit,"
not
based
on
some
lottery
put
in
by
a
governor.
democrats
have
never
been
farther
outside
the
mainstream.
liberal
politicians
want
to
eliminate

dream.
liberal
politicians
want
to
eliminate
private

and
force
everyone
onto

remember
the
lies
from
the
previous
administration.
if
you
like
your

you
can
keep
your

if
you
like

lie
after
another.
28
times
it
was
said
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
total
lie.
my
administration
is
defending
your
right
to
choose
the
plan
and
doctor
that
is
best
for
you.
we're
offering
right
now
plans
up
to
60%
cheaper
than
obamacare
and
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre
existing
conditions.
always.
always.
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late
term
abortion.
and
then
you'll
have
like
a
governor
of
"virginia,"
it's
not
only
late
term
"abortion,"
it's
killing
the
baby
after
the
baby
is
born.
how
about
that?
think
of
that.
think
of
that.
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child

democrats
are
now
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
and
they're
the
"party,"
"frankly,"
of
socialism.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
freedom.
we're
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
family.
we're
the
party
of
the
american
dream.
i'm
fighting
for
you
each
and
every
day.
i
had
a
great
life.
i
used
to
get
great
publicity.
nobody
got
better…
i
had
such
a
great
life.
it
was
so
easy.
my
great
"wife,"
the
first
"lady,"
"melania,"
she
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
you've
always
been
a
hard
worker.
you
love
to
"work,"
but
your
life
was
a
lot
easier
in
the
old
"days.\""
but
i
love
it
and
you
know
why
i
love
it?
because
we're
accomplishing
so
much.
nobody
ever
thought
it
would
be
possible
to
do
the
things
we're
doing.
even
a
thing
like
right
to
"try,"
right?
right
to
try.
they've
been
trying
to
get
that
for
years
and
years
and
years.
that's
people
that
are
really
"sick,"
terminally
ill.
they
couldn't
get
medicine.
we
have
the
greatest
"doctors,"
the
greatest
"clinics,"
the
greatest
technicians
in
the
world.
they
couldn't
get
anything.
they'd
traveled
to
asia
if
they
had
money.
they
traveled
to
europe.
they'd
travel
all
over
the
world
hoping
for
a
cure.
if
they
had
no
money
they'd
just
go
home.
they'd
die.
they
had
no
hope.
for
44
"years,"
they've
been
trying
to
get
right
to
try.
we
are
so
advanced
in
medicine.
we
have
a
lot
of
things
that
probably
work
or
possibly
"work,"
but
we
weren't
allowed
legally
to
give
that
to
these
people
that
were
so
sick.
you
know
why?
because
they
didn't
want
this
drug
if
it
didn't
work
to
hurt
the
"people,"
but
the
people
were
terminally
ill.
so
i
got
it
approved
and
it
wasn't
easy.
it
was
complicated.
the
insurance
companies
didn't
want
to
do
it.
the
government
didn't
want
to
do
it.
the
doctors
didn't
want
to
do
it.
tremendous
liability.
but
our
country
didn't
want
to
do
it.
they
"said,"
"\"well,"
if
it
doesn't
"work,"
we're
going
to
get
"sued.\""
i
"say,"
"\"so"
they'll
sign
an
"agreement,"
very
"strong,"
one
"page,"
taking
all
liability
away
from
the
united
"states,"
from
the
drug
"companies,"
from
the
"doctors,"
all
liability.
they're
terminally
ill.
let's
try
"it.\""
and
you
know
what?
it's
been
a
miracle.
so
many
people
have
done
so
well.
it's
great.
we
got
it
done.
when
i
set
about
the
"agreement,"
they
had
these
great
lawyers
and
they
"said,"
"\"gee,"
that's
a
good
"idea.\""
they'd
been
working
in
this
few
years.
they
"said,"
"\"that's"
a
good
"idea.\""
i
"said,"
"\"yeah,"
it's
a
good
idea.
how
about
getting
you
to
me
like
in
about
two
"hours?\""
right
to
try.
it's
a
great
thing.
but
we
have
so
many
things
like
that.
i
have
lists
that
you
wouldn't
even
believe.
i
have
lists
that
go
on
for
pages
of
things
we've
done.
we've
launched
a
historic
initiative
to
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
"drugs,"
including
a
plan
to
allow
companies
to
import
lower
cost
drugs
from
other
countries.
it's
a
very
unfair
system.
our
country
pays
the
highest
prices
in
the
world.
last
year
was
the
first
time
in
51
years
that
drug
pricing
for
prescription
drugs
actually
came
down.
now
we're
going
to
bring
it
down
by
a
lot.
we're
going
to
bring
it
down
a
lot.
and
now…
so
other
countries…
here's
an
"example,"
canada
pays
half
the
price
for
a
lot
of
drugs
that
we
do.
so
we
have
a
great
governor
in
the
state
of
"florida,"
ron
"desantis,"
calls
me
up.
doing
a
great
job.
ron
desantis.
he
was
at
three
and
he
went
to
70.
that's
a
pretty
good
"increase,"
right?
ron
"desantis,"
a
great
governor.
and
he
comes
to
"me,"
he
"goes,"
"\"you"
"know,"
if
you
buy
the
"drugs,"
if
we
buy
the
"drugs,"
because
this
is
so
botched
"up,"
we
have
a
middleman.
it's
not
a
good
"situation.\""
he
"said,"
"\"if"
i
could
go
and
buy
the
drugs
from
"canada,"
i
could
save
"50%.\""
i
"said,"
"\"do"
it.
do
it.
and
if
you
can
buy
them
from
"europe,"
because
their
"system…\""
"like,"
remember
i
used
to
scream
when
i
was
winning
states
and
not
getting
the
delegates
that
i
was
entitled
to
and
i'd
say
the
system
is
rigged?
"well,"
the
drug
system
is
rigged.
it's
rigged.
so
if
we
can
buy
the
same
drug
made
by
the
same
pharmaceutical
company
from
europe
or
from
canada
or
from
other
places
at
a
big
deep
"discount,"
we're
doing
it
and
we're
giving
them
the
right
to
do
it.
just
happened
today.
and
we're
doing
one
other
thing
"that,"
believe
it
or
not
is
even
"bigger,"
but
you'll
be
seeing
that
over
the
next
two
weeks.
with
the
help
of
your
great
"senator,"
rob
"portman,"
we've
taken
bold
action
to
confront
the
opioid
epidemic
and
in
"ohio,"
drug
overdose
deaths
went
down
22%
last
"year,"
22%.
"no,"
but
think
of
that.
"opioid,"
big
"problem,"
big
problem.
deaths
went
down.
opioid
"deaths,"
22%.
nobody
writes
that.
nobody
talks
about
that.
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
that.
good
"job,"
rob.
good
job.
good
"job,"
mike.
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
accountability
on
behalf
of
our
great
veterans.
they
been
trying
to
pass
va
choice
for
four
decades.
they
couldn't
get
it
done.
we
got
it
done.
we
got
it
done.
this
is
where
a
veteran
would
stand
online
for
"three,"
"four,"
"five,"
six
"days,"
for
three
"weeks,"
for
five
weeks.
sometimes
they're
okay.
by
the
time
they
see
a
"doctor,"
they're
terminally
ill.
and
i
"said,"
"\"you"
"know,"
i
have
a
great
"idea.\""
because
i
not
been
doing
that
this
long.
you
"know,"
we've
been
working
with
this
for…
i've
been
thinking
about
it
a
lot.
this
was
during
the
campaign.
what
a
campaign
that
"was,"
right?
was
that
a
campaign
or
what?
and
i
came
back
to
my
people.
i
had
experts
and
i
"said,"
"\"i"
have
a
great
idea.
these
lines
for
the
veterans
are
too
long.
it
takes
them
"three,"
four
weeks
sometimes
to
see
a
doctor.
i
have
a
great
idea.
let's
let
them
go
outside.
go
to
a
private
doctor.
we'll
pay
the
bill.
they'll
be
fixed
up
all
perfect
and
they
can
do
it
immediately.
we'll
pay
the
"bill.\""
and
i
thought…
i
"said,"
"\"man,"
am
i
smart?
i
am
the
smartest
guy
to
think
of
"that.\""
so
i
went
before
this
panel
of
experts
that
were
with
me
working
on
things
and
i
"said,"
"\"how"
do
you
like
that
"idea?\""
and
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we've
known
about
it
for
about
40
"years,"
but
we've
never
"been…\""
i
"said,"
"\"really?"
you've
known
about
it
that
"long?\""
but
here's
the
thing.
we
got
it
done.
nobody
else
could
get
it
done.
nobody
else.
and
accountability.
you
couldn't
fire
anybody.
if
they
were
treating
our
vets
"badly,"
you
couldn't
fire
them
for
anything.
people
could
steal.
they
could
be
sadistic
to
our
vets.
by
the
"way,"
they
wouldn't
have
done
that
in
primetime
to
our
vets.
i
can
tell
you
that.
they
can
be
whatever
they
want.
you
couldn't
fire
them.
and
it
was
because
of
unions
and
it
was
because
of
other
things.
civil
service.
very
tough.
you
couldn't
fire
anybody
for
almost
anything.
we
had
cases
where
people
got…
they
got
caught
stealing
a
lot
of
money
and
you
couldn't
fire
them.
we
got
va
accountability.
now
we
"say,"
"\"jim,"
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
you're
"fired.\""
we're
rebuilding
our
military.
and
after
years
of
budget
cuts
and
"layoffs,"
the
army
tank
plant
in…
do
you
lima?
you
call
it
"lima,"
right?
see?
you
"know,"
most
people
call
it
"lima,"
but
i
know
lima.
but
you
know
why?
because
i
came
here
and
they
"said,"
"\"we're"
closing
this
"plant.\""
i
"said,"
"\"what"
kind
of
a
plant
is
"it?\""
remember
when
i
was
here?
in
lima.
and
i
used
to
"say,"
"\"you"
mean
"lima?\""
they
"said,"
"\"no,"
sir.
it's
"lima.\""
that's
why…
"because,"
but
"leah,"
hey
"look,"
i'll
be
honest
with
you
because
they
have
it
wrong
with
the
"teleprompter,"
okay?
and
i
would
have
been
in
big
trouble.
but
the
good
news
is
i
don't
use
the
teleprompter
too
much.
if
i
"did,"
you
would've
been
out
of
here
a
long
time
ago
because
it
gets
very
boring
when
you
do
the
teleprompter
deal.
but
in
"lima,"
and
i
"said,"
"\"what"
kind
of
a
"plant?\""
and
i
"said,"
"\"let's"
go
see
"it.\""
during
the
campaign
i
went
to
see
it
and
they
make
the
"incredible,"
the
best
army
tank
in
the
world
and
i
couldn't
believe
the
"complexity,"
the
genius.
i
"said,"
"\"wait"
a
minute.
you
close
"this,"
you'll
never
be
able
to
open
it
again.
you
can't
open
this.
this
isn't
like
a
normal
situation
that
you
can
open
four
walls
and
a
roof.
this
is
complicated.
this
is
genius
and
you'll
never
replace
these
men
and
women
that
work
"here.\""
i
said…
and
i
didn't
know
anything
at
the
time
other
than
i
"said,"
"\"you're"
not
closing
"it.\""
they
took
it
off
to
list.
they
kept
it
open
and
now
we're
making
army
tanks
around
the
clock.
we're
investing
in
the
future
of
human
space
flight.
americans
won
the
race
to
the
moon
and
we
will
now
win
the
race
to
mars.
it's
going
to
be
amazing.
and
you
"know,"
one
thing
i
have
to
say
"also,"
and
we're
also
winning
the
race
to
"great,"
great
strategic
defense
and
"offense,"
not
just
mars.
and
mike
pence
is
doing
a
great
job
on
that.
great
job.
to
protect
america's
"security,"
i
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
horrible
iran
nuclear
"deal,"
a
"horrible,"
stupid
deal.
we
gave
iran
$150
billion.
we
gave
iran
$
1.8
billion
in
cash.
plane
loads
of
cash.
i
wonder
what
they
saw
when
those
planes
landed.
i
wonder
what
happened
to
the
cash?
can
you
believe
it?
one
$1.8
billion
we
gave
them
in
cash.
and
remember
what
i
"said,"
iran
is
a
much
different
country
than
two
and
a
half
years
ago.
when
i
took
"over,"
iran
was
all
over.
they
had
14
to
18
different
sites
of
confliction.
they
were
all
over.
and
now
they
just
want
to…
they
want
a
negotiated
deal
so
badly.
iran.
iran.
i
recognized
israel's
true
capital
and
opened
the
american
embassy
in
jerusalem.
and
just
a
few
months
"ago,"
we
recognized
the
golan
heights.
you
know
that.
that's
another
one.
big
one
for
the
security
of
israel.
also
recognized
the
legitimate
government
of
venezuelan
and
we
condemn
any
of
the
socialist
brutality
taking
place.
let's
see
what
happens
there.
let's
see
what
happens.
tonight
we
renew
our
resolves
that
america
will
never
be
a
socialist
country.
"never,"
"ever,"
ever
will
it
be
a
socialist
country.
no
matter
what
label
they
"use,"
a
vote
for
any
democrat
in
2020
is
a
vote
for
the
rise
of
radical
socialism
and
the
destruction
of
our
"great,"
our
"beautiful,"
our
wonderful
american
dream.
we're
not
going
to
let
our
country
ever
go
down
the
route
of
socialism.
you
must
never
forget
that
the
2020
election
is
about
one
thing.
it's
about
you.
i
say
it
again.
i
say
it
all
the
time.
never
happened
before.
there's
never
been
a
movement
like
this.
they've
had
movements.
they
never
went…
they
won
a
state.
they
did
well
in
the
state.
we
won
32
states.
there's
never
been
anything
like
it.
there's
never
been
anything
like
it.
but
this
movement
is
about
your
family
and
your
"future,"
and
it's
about
the
life
and
the
fate
of
your
country.
we
begin
our…
"hey,"
"look,"
this
is
a
good
place.
is
this
a
great
thing
to
do?
we
begin
our
campaign
and
we're
going
to
do
"great,"
bob.
"right,"
bob?
"bob,"
if
we
don't
do
"great,"
you're
"fired,"
bob.
you're
fired.
but
think
of
"it,"
our
ohio
campaign
with
the
best
"record,"
the
best
"results,"
the
best
"agenda,"
and
the
only
positive
vision
for
our
nation's
future.
and
"again,"
remember
"this,"
ohio
is
doing
better
today
than
it's
"ever,"
"ever,"
ever
done
before.
it's
the
best
it's
ever
done.
what's
going
to
do…
a
guy
like
a
sleepy
joe
biden
is
going
to
come
in
and
"say,"
"\"but"
i
could
do
better.
i
could
do
"better.\""
he
wants
to
go
back
to
sleep.
together
we
will
continue
unleashing
the
power
of
american
enterprise
so
every
american
can
reach
their
fullest
and
highest
"potential,"
tremendous
potential.
our
country
has
such
tremendous
potential.
you
"know,"
we've
had…
the
last
"week,"
we've
had
the
highest
stock
market
in
the
history
of
our
country.
that
means
401ks.
that
means
job.
but
there's
tremendous
potential
to
go
up.
we
have
tremendous
potential
to
go
up.
with
your
"help,"
we
will
elect
a
republican
congress
to
create
a
"safe,"
"modern,"
"fair,"
and
lawful
system
of
immigration.
we
will
enact
trade
deals
that
ensure
more
products
are
proudly
stamped
with
those
four
beautiful
words
"\"made"
in
the
"usa\""
or
"\"made"
in
"america\"."
either
one.
you
can
use
either
one.
made
in
"america,"
made
in
the
us.
we
will
achieve
new
breakthroughs
in
science
and
medicine
and
i
see
what
they're
doing.
i
see
it.
they
show
me
the
things
we're
doing
in
our
country
today.
there's
never
been
anything
like
it.
we
will
be
ending
the
aids
epidemic
shortly
in
america
and
curing
childhood
cancer
very
shortly.
we
will
defend
"privacy,"
free
"speech,"
religious
"liberty,"
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
just
remember
with
the
"democrats,"
there
is
no
second
amendment.
you
can
forget
about
keep
and
bear
arms.
you
can
forget
it.
above
"all,"
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
the
values
that
bind
us
together
as
one
america.
we
will
never
ever
stop
fighting.
we
"support,"
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
stand
with
our
incredible
heroes
of
law
enforcement.
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
work
and
we
believe
in
the
sanctity
of
life.
and
we
believe
that
faith
and
"family,"
not
government
and
"bureaucracy,"
are
the
true
american
way.
we
believe
that
children
should
be
taught
to
love
our
"country,"
honor
our
"history,"
and
always
be
"proud,"
patriotic
americans.
and
we
will
always
live
by
the
words
of
our
national
"motto,"
"\"in"

we
"trust.\""
two
days
"ago,"
i
spoke
at
the
400th
anniversary
of
the
first
representative
legislature
assembly
at
"jamestown,"
virginia.
it
was
beautiful.
it
was
incredible.
i
was…
i
must
tell
"you,"
i
was
reminded
of
so
many
great
things
in
our
country.
we
have
been
blessed
with
such
a
remarkable
and
priceless
heritage.
we
are
the
greatest
republic

earth
and

are
going
to
keep
it
that
way.
every
day
of
my
"presidency,"
we
will
never
forget
that
we
are
americans
and
the
future
belongs
to
us.

i
love
new

and
i'm
thrilled
to
be
back
right
here
in
the
garden
state.
thank
you.
the
garden
state.
together
we're
achieving
historic
victories
for
new
jersey
families.
you
see
it
every
single
day.
the
new
jersey
unemployment
rate
has
reached
the
lowest
of
all
time.
more
people
are
working
today
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
than
ever
before.
i
have
to
tell
you
more
"people,"
almost
160
"million,"
are
working
right
now
in
the
united
states.
that's
the
highest
level
of
employment
in
the
history
of
our
country.
a
lot
of
countries
aren't
doing
so
"well,"
just
so
you
understand.
tomorrow
we
will
replace
the
nafta
"nightmare,"
one
of
the
worst
trade
deals
ever
in
"history,"
with
the
incredible
brand
new
us-mexico-canada
"agreement,"
the
usmca.
a
massive
win
for
new
jersey
"workers,"
new
jersey
"farmers,"
new
jersey
union
"people,"
new
jersey
manufacturers
and
everybody.
weeks
ago
we
also
signed
a
fantastic
new
trade
agreement
with
china
that
will
boost
new
jersey
exports
and
defend
new
jersey
jobs.
$250
billion
coming
in.
oh
that's
going
to
be
so
nice.
we're
restoring
america's
industrial
might
like
never
before.
they're
all
coming
back.
they
want
to
be
where
the
action
is.
after
years
of
devastating
defense
cuts
we
have
fully
rebuilt
the
united
states
military.
thanks
to
the
incredible
courage
of
our
"warriors,"
the
greatest
warriors
in
the
"world,"
the
isis
caliphate
has
been
totally
destroyed
and
its
savage
"founder,"
and
"leader,"
al-baghdadi
is
dead.
weeks
"ago,"
at
my
"direction,"
the
us
military
launched
a
flawless
precision
strike
that
killed
the
world's
number
one
terrorist
qasem
soleimani.
soleimani
was
responsible
for
murdering
and
wounding
thousands
of
"americans,"
and
actively
planning
new
"attacks,"
but
we
stopped
him
cold.
yet
washington
"democrats,"
like
crazy
bernie
sanders
and
nervous
nancy
"pelosi,"
they
opposed
our
action
to
save
american
lives.
they
oppose
it.
they
oppose
it.
you
know
the
roadside
bombs
that
you
see
hurting
our
people
and
lots
of
other
people
so
badly?
the
"legs,"
the
"arms,"
wiped
out.
no
"legs,"
no
arms.
soleimani
loved
that.
that
was
his
weapon
of
choice.
we
didn't
like
him.
he's
not
around
anymore.
well
we
are
creating
jobs
and
killing
terrorists
the
congressional
democrats
are
obsessed
with
demented
"hoaxes,"
crazy
witch
"hunts,"
and
deranged
partisan
crusades.
it's
all
they
know
how
to
do.
the
do
nothing
democrats.
they
have
spent
the
last
three
"years,"
and
probably
even
before
i
came
down
on
that
beautiful
escalator
with
our
beautiful
future
first
"lady,"
trying
to
overthrow
the
last
election.
we
will
make
sure
that
they
face
another
crushing
defeat
in
the
next
election.
we
are
going
to
have
a
victory
that's
even
greater
than
2016.
this
november
we
are
going
to
win
back
the
"house,"
we
are
going
to
hold
the
"senate,"
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
white
house.
the
american
people
are
disgusted
by
the
washington
democrat
…
you
see
it.
you
see
it.
which
is
"worse,"
the
impeachment
hoax
or
the
witch
hunts
from
russia?
but
we're
going
to
be
signing
up
millions
and
millions
of
registered
"independents,"
democrat
voters.
today
i
had
the
best
polls
that
i've
ever
had
since
being
elected.
the
best
we've
ever
had.
remember
i
used
to
go
over
polls?
but
i
only
used
to
talk
about
them
when
i
was
doing
well
otherwise
i
wouldn't.
we
had
our
best
polls.
americans
of
all
political
beliefs
are
sick
and
tired
of
the
radical
rage
filled
left
socialists.
i
never
saw
anything
…
what's
going
on
in
this
country
…
what's
going
on
in
this
"country,"
really
the
democrat
party
is
the
socialist
party
and
maybe
worse.
voters
are
making
a
mass
exodus
from
that
party
and
we
are
welcoming
them
to
the
republican
party
with
wide
open
arms.
the
republican
party
is
doing
great.
we
are
privileged
to
be
joined
tonight
by
a
courageous
leader
who
left
the
democrat
party
because
he
has
had
enough
of
their
"extremism,"
enough
of
their
"socialism,"
and
enough
of
their
vile
hoaxes
and
scams.
he's
had
enough.
i
tell
you
he
really
"is,"
he's
a
brave
guy.
he
just
"said,"
"\""
i'm
not
doing
it.
i'm
not
doing
it.
it's
a
"hoax,"
it's
a
"scam,"
i'm
not
doing
"it.\""
we
called
"him,"
"\"you're"
our
kind
of
guy.
let's
"go.\""
it
didn't
take
much
because
he
believes
like
we
do.
we
are
truly
honored
to
be
here
with
the
newest
republican
member
of
the
house
of
"representatives,"
your
great
"congressman,"
jeff
van
drew.
i
have
to
tell
you
a
few
weeks
ago
jeff
was
one
of
the
few
brave
and
principled
democrat
"lawmakers,"
in
all
fairness
we've
been
after
him
for
a
"longtime,"
who
stood
up
to
the
house
democrats
and
the
outrageous
abusive
power
that
you
see
going
on
right
now.
they
can't
win
an
election
so
they're
trying
to
steal
an
election.
it's
not
happening
folks.
it's
not
happening.
jeff
had
the
guts
to
defy
the
left-wing
fanatics
in
his
own
"party,"
and
to
stand
tall
in
defense
of
our
"constitution,"
our
"freedom,"
and
democracy
itself.
i
just
want
to
…
i
have
to
tell
"you,"
i've
gotten
to
know
him
really
well
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks.
he's
a
great
"guy,"
he's
a
brave
"guy,"
he
shares
our
values.
he
supports
lower
"taxes,"
not
bad.
they
want
to
raise
your
taxes.
how
did
that
work
jeff?
how
did
you
get
elected
with
that
one?
less
"regulation,"
a
strong
national
defense.
he
loves
our
"military,"
loves
our
"vets,"
and
police.
he
is
a
tireless
champion
for
the
state
of
new
jersey.
he
loves
your
second
"amendment,"
which
is
under
siege
by
the
democrats.
"jeff,"
it's
an
honor
to
be
with
you.
"please,"
please.
thank
you.
thank
you
man.
we
have
tens
of
thousands
of
people
outside.
if
anybody
would
like
to
give
them
your
place
please
let
us
"know,"
but
we
have
thousands
and
thousands.
tens
of
thousands.
jeff
gave
me
a
"number,"
he
"said,"
"\"175,000"
people
signed
"up.\""
is
that
a
fact?
175?
i
think
he's
on
his
way.
i
think
he's
on
his
way.
thank
you
"jeff,"
great
job.
thank
you
jeff.
thank
you
jeff.
it's
been
a
little
bit
of
a
story.
you
see
the
fakers
back
there?
fake
news.
fake.
you
know
if
another
candidate
has
"1,000"
people
they
say
he
spoke
to
a
massive
crowd.
if
they
have
"10,000,"
like
pocahontas
went
into
central
park
in
new
york.
this
young
men
could
have
"10,000"
"people,"
you
know
"that,"
in
central
park.
she
had
"10,000"
people
like
in
central
park.
i
"said,"
"\"what's"
the
big
"deal?\""
they
made
"it,"
"\"oh"
the
crowds
are
so
"large.\""
jeff
just
told
you
he
had
"175,000"
people
sign
up.
seriously
you
have
to
see
outside.
they
know
because
they
have
to
"follow,"
they're
trailers.
i
call
them
trailers.
but
they're
fake.
they're
fake.
they're
not
honest.
let
me
just
tell
"you,"
so
here's
the
"story,"
so
we
have
these
massive
crowds
that
fill
up
stadiums
every
single
time.
we
have
tens
of
thousands
of
people
outside.
they
never
mention
it.
they
never
mention
"it,"
so
maybe
they
will
tonight.
but
that's
an
all-time
record.
this
is
not
a
brand
new
place
and
unfortunately
it
holds
"10,000"
people
or
less.
we
set
the
all-time
record.
you
know
why?
because
for
games
…
see
the
floor
packed
with
people?
for
games
you're
playing
ice
hockey
or
"basketball,"
so
we
broke
the
all-time
record
in
this
house.
it's
a
wonderful
house
in
a
wonderful
community.
also
in
"wildwood,"
like
we're
in
the
middle
of
winter.
there
is
nobody
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
it's
a
great
place
in
the
summer.
those
streets
are
packed
all
the
way
back
to
the
airplane
practically.
but
on
june
2nd
everybody
has
to
do
us
all
a
favor.
number
one
you
have
to
get
out
and
vote
republican.
get
rid
of
these
clowns.
you
have
to
get
out
and
vote
for
really
a
brave
man.
what
he
did
was
incredible.
jeff
van
"drew,"
what
he
did
was
incredible.
get
out
and
vote.
he's
going
to
have
a
big
victory.
he's
going
to
have
a
big
victory.
we're
grateful
to
have
with
us
this
evening
some
wonderful
friends
of
"mine,"
people
that
i've
known
"forever,"
your
former
governor
who
did
a
terrific
"job,"
chris
christie.
chris.
great
"chris,"
great
job.
your
wonderful
republican
state
chairman
doug
"steinhardt,"
what
a
job
he's
doing.
thank
you
doug.
thank
you
doug.
my
campaign's
two
great
new
jersey
co-chairs
and
i
think
we'll
play
for
the
state
…
you
know
they
all
say
republicans
can't
win.
tell
me
why?
they
"said,"
"\"should"
you
move
this
to
the
"meadowlands?\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
want
to
be
in
south
jersey.
we
want
to
be
with
our
"friends.\""
but
we
could
have
filled
up
the
meadowlands
arena
two
or
three
times.
maybe
we'll
do
it
during
the
summer.
should
we
do
it
during
the
summer?
maybe.
but
two
brave
"guys,"
two
great
politicians.
people
that
love
our
state.
state
senators
mike
testa
and
joe
pennacchio.
joe
pennacchio.
thank
you
joe.
thank
you.
thank
you.
two
incredible
new
jersey
"natives,"
you've
never
heard
of
kellyanne
conway
have
you
say
something.
thank
you
kellyanne.
i
just
want
to
thank
republicans
because
what
they've
been
doing
is
incredible.
republican
leadership
in
this
country
we're
"winning,"
"winning,"
winning
like
never
before.
we're
winning
again
and
we've
got
a
party
that's
a
very
different
"part,"
a
much
stronger
"party,"
a
much
more
inclusive
party.
we
have
a
party
that
we
love.
we
have
a
party
that
has
the
votes.
we
have
a
party
like
they've
never
had
before.
the
republican
party
respected
again.
i
have
to
say
"this,"
america
is
winning
again
and
america
is
thriving
again
like
never
before.
since
the
election
we
have
created
seven
million
new
jobs.
the
average
unemployment
rate
under
my
administration
is
lower
than
any
previous
"administration,"
listen
to
this
"one,"
in
united
states
history.
that's
a
good
"fact,"
the
lowest
in
history.
thank
you
man.
we
have
a
great
veteran
up
here
and
he
"said,"
"\"we"
love
you.
we
love
"you.\""
the
veterans.
are
we
doing
good
for
the
veterans?
thank
you.
african
"american,"
hispanic
"american,"
and
asian
american
unemployment
rates
have
reached
the
lowest
levels
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
country.
ever
recorded!
women's
unemployment
is
at
a
65
year
low.
sorry
about
that.
soon
it's
going
to
be
historic.
another
couple
of
good
months
it'll
be
historic.
65
years
for
women.
in
the
eight
years
before
i
took
office
over
"300,000"
working
age
people
left
the
workforce.
they
had
no
choice.
in
just
three
years
of
my
administration
3.5
million
people
have
joined
the
workforce.
nobody
believes
"it,"
including
the
fake
…
the
workforce.
nobody
believes
it
including
the
fake
news.
if
i
would
have
said
that
during
the
campaign
that
we
were
going
to
produce
numbers
like
"this,"
the
fakeness
would
have
been
hitting
me.
he's
exaggerating.
he's
"lying,"
"pinocchio,"
pinocchio.
the
press
is
very
dishonest.
more
than
two
million
millennials
have
gotten
jobs
and
their
wages
have
grown
by
nearly
5%
every
"year,"
which
is
a
record.
a
record
number
of
americans
between
the
ages
of
25
and
34
are
now
"working,"
another
record.
under
the
trump
"economy,"
the
lowest
paid
earners
are
reaping
the
fastest
gains
of
anybody.
you
don't
hear
that
because
this
is
a
blue
collar
boom.
it's
very
nice.
it's
about
time.
it's
about
time.
it's
been
"many,"
many
decades.
earnings
for
the
bottom
10%
are
rising
faster
than
earnings
for
the
top
"10%,"
first
time
ever.
since
my
"election,"
the
net
worth
of
the
bottom
half
of
wage
earners
has
"increased,"
listen
to
"this,"
by
"47%,"
three
times
faster
than
the
increase
for
the
top
1%.
median
household
income
is
at
an
all
time
high.
for
president
"bush,"
in
eight
years
it
was
"$450,"
over
eight
years.
think
of
this
for
a
second.
under
president
barack
hussein
"obama,"
for
eight
years
it
was
"$975,"
so
eight
"years,"
eight
"years,"
"450,"
975
under
your
favorite
"president,"
and
when
you
include
the
tax
"cuts,"
the
regulation
cuts
that
nobody's
ever
cut
taxes
like
this.
nobody's
ever
cut
regulations.
that's
why
all
these
jobs
are
being
built.
under
president
"trump,"
for
three
"years,"
the
number
is
almost
"$10,000,"
and
that's
three
"years,"
and
it's
going
up.
it's
going
up
very
substantial.
that's
a
big
difference.
new
business
applications
in
new
jersey
have
just
soared
to
a
record
"high,"
and
we
have
lifted
10
million
people
nationwide
off
federal
welfare.
they're
off.
they
are
off
federal
welfare.
nobody
would've
believed
these
numbers.
someday
they're
going
to
write
the
true
story.
our
child
tax
credit
alone
is
delivering
"$2,200"
a
year
to
40
million
american
families.
we
have
"ended,"
so
importantly
for
"you,"
the
war
on
american
energy.
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
world.
we
don't
need
anybody
else's
energy
anymore.
it's
so
nice.
what
happened
in
the
last
three
years
with
energy
is
"incredible,"
but
extreme
liberals
in
washington
want
to
shut
down
u.s.
"energy,"
including
through
the
so-called
green
new
deal.
close
your
factories.
get
rid
of
your
cows.
you
don't
have
too
many
cows
in
"wildwood,"
but
if
you
"do,"
they're
gone.
we
will
never
sacrifice
america's
energy
independence.
took
us
a
long
time
to
get
"there,"
and
we
really
picked
it
up
over
the
last
three
years.
what
we've
done
is
"incredible,"
pipelines
all
over.
pipelines
are
good.
they're
"underground,"
they're
"good,"
environmentally
sound.
to
lift
up
forgotten
communities
that
need
investment
the
most.
these
are
the
communities
that
really
have
suffered.
we
"created,"
with
the
help
of
a
great
gentleman
from
the
state
of
south
"carolina,"
you
know
who
i'm
talking
about?
tim
"scott,"
right?
senator
tim
"scott,"
he's
an
incredible
guy.
he
really
is.
he
came
to
my
office
and
he
had
this
idea
that
he's
wanted
to
do
for
a
long
time.
senator
tim
"scott,"
opportunity
"zones,"
and
jobs
and
investment
are
now
pouring
into
nearly
170
newly
designated
opportunity
zones
right
here
in
new
"jersey,"
all
over
the
united
states.
"billions,"
and
"billions,"
and
billions
of
"dollars,"
and
not
government
"dollars,"
they're
flowing
into
the
opportunities
zones
into
areas
where
investment
was
dead.
for
"decades,"
politicians
ran
for
office
promising
to
protect
american
"workers,"
but
then
they
went
to
washington
and
they
lined
their
pockets
with
special
address
"cash,"
and
they
shipped
american
jobs
and
dreams
to
other
countries.
they
closed
up
your
factories.
they
got
rid
of
your
jobs.
they
didn't
have
to
pay
taxes.
globalist
politicians
lowered
our
economic
defenses
and
allowed
other
nations
to
rob
our
"factories,"
steal
our
farms
and
ransack
our
communities.
not
"anymore,"
not
"anymore,"
because
we
are
defenseless
no
more
because
long
last
you
have
a
president
who
puts
america
first.
is
that
okay?
the
united
states
"laws,"
listen
to
this
"number,"
and
you
know
if
it
was
"wrong,"
the
fake
news
would
be
all
over
"me,"
and
i've
been
saying
it
for
three
years.
the
united
states
lost
"60,000"
factories
and
plants.
think
of
that.
you
wouldn't
think
that's
possible
because
of
stupid
trade
"deals,"
because
of
bad
leadership.
during
the
16
years
of
the
two
prior
"administrations,"
under
just
three
"years,"
my
administration
has
now
added
"12,000"
new
"factories,"
and
many
more
are
being
built
and
they're
pouring
back
into
the
united
"states,"
because
that's
where
the
action
is.
that's
where
they
want
to
be.
they
are
pouring
back
into
our
"country,"
new
plants
and
factories.
you
see
them
all
over.
i
passed
two
of
them
coming
"in,"
brand
"new,"
beautiful
plants
and
factories.
they're
pouring
back
in.
this
is
where
the
action
is.
this
is
where
they
want
to
be.
i
see
the
"leaders,"
they
"say,"
"\"it's"
incredible
what
happened
to
your
"country.\""
i
"said,"
"\"don't"
tell
me
that.
we
want
you
to
have
your
companies
build
plants
in
new
jersey
and
other
"places,\""
and
that's
what's
happening.
but
on
no
issue
have
washington
democrats
thoroughly
betrayed
the
american
people
than
the
issue
of
immigration.
"left-wing,"
"radical,"
politician
support
deadly
sanctuary
"cities,"
and
"remember,"
a
sanctuary
city
is
a
jurisdiction
that
refuses
to
hand
over
criminal
aliens
that
are
in
local
law
enforcement
custody.
"instead,"
they
order
them
to
be
released
into
your
community.
what
the
hell
is
going
on?
what
is
going
on?
once
set
"loose,"
these
criminal
aliens
are
free
to
continue
their
crimes
spree
against
innocent
americans.
right
here
in
new
"jersey,"
your
state's
democrat
leaders
have
instituted
sanctuary
policies
that
result
in
dangerous
predators
being
set
free
into
your
community.
for
"example,"
cumberland
"county,"
we
all
know
cumberland
county
very
"well,"
right?
good
luck
with
this
one.
they
released
an
illegal
alien
criminal
with
multiple
charges
for
sexual
assault
of
a
child.
he
is
now
at
"large,"
free
to
search
for
another
innocent
victim.
they
didn't
want
to
give
him
to
"ice,"
and
i
want
to
thank
"ice,"
because
the
abuse
they
take
and
the
incredible
job
they
do.
right
"here,"
another
criminal
alien
was
arrested
for
a
violent
assault
in
new
jersey.
the
sanctuary
jurisdiction
of
middlesex
county
defied
the
ice
request
to
detain
him.
local
authorities
released
him
and
he
went
on
to
commit
a
gruesome
triple
murder.
i
could
read
these
"cases,"
"honestly,"
i
could
read
and
state
these
cases
to
you
all
night.
i
could
state
these
cases
to
you
all
night.
no
american
should
ever
be
"hurt,"
harmed
or
killed
because
left-wing
"politicians,"
"democrats,"
decided
to
shield
and
shelter…
"look,"
"look,"
wait.
you
have
criminals
that
are
on
the
streets
that
should
be
in
jail.
you
have
criminals
that
on
the
street
that
should
be
taken
the
hell
out
of
our
country
and
brought
back
to
where
they
came
from.
by
the
"way,"
ice
has
removed
thousands
upon
thousands
of
ms-13
gang
"members,"
the
most
brutal
people.
you
don't
want
to
do
that
job.
maybe
you
"do,"
a
couple
of
tough
people
up
there.
anybody
want
to
be
with
ice?
you
got
a
lot
of
tough
people
in
new
jersey.
new
jersey
is
different.
i
think
new
jersey
is
different.
"no,"
but
these
ice
"people,"
they
love
our
country.
they're
proud
and
they're
tough
"people,"
and
they'll
go
right
into
a
pack.
they
call
it
a
pack
and
they
start
swinging.
everyone's
swinging
or
they
end
up
standing
up.
that's
the
end
of
"that,"
and
you
know
what
they
do?
they
bring
the
ms-13
and
many
other
gang
members
and
other
members
back
to
el
"salvador,"
back
to
"honduras,"
back
to
"guatemala,"
back
to
mexico.
i
want
to
thank
mexico
because
you
know
what's
"happening,"
right?
thousands
and
thousands
at
this
"moment,"
"27,000"
soldiers
from
"mexico,"
protecting
our
southern
border.
i
want
to
thank
the
president.
democrats
stand
for
"crime,"
corruption
and
chaos.
republicans
stand
for
"law,"
order
and
"justice,"
and
say
what
you
"want,"
but
those
are
the
facts.
we
are
removing
these
illegal
criminals
and
gang
members.
we
are
literally
taking
them
by
so
"many,"
thousands
and
"thousands,"
and
we're
bringing
him
back.
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
of
border
patrol
to
secure
our
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
seven
straight
months
in
a
row.
we
have
the
numbers
down
by
75%
since
"spring,"
75%.
we
have
ended
catch
and
release
and
"really,"
"look,"
i
had
another
party.
i
could
get
anything.
if
i
wanted
to
spend
money
on
"anything,"
look
with
the
"military,"
we
got
two
trillion
"dollars,"
right?
more.
two
"trillion,"
all
made
in
"america,"
right?
everything.
best
"planes,"
best
"missiles,"
best
"everything,"
made
in
america.
if
i
wanted
to
build
"anything,"
the
only
thing
they
put
the
whole
weight
of
their
"party,"
they
didn't
want
us
to
have
the
wall.
they
knew
it
worked.
many
of
them
voted
five
years
ago
for
a
wall.
they
just
didn't
know
how
to
get
it
built.
i
do.
but
what
happened
is
through
a
series
of
court
cases
and
other
"things,"
the
money
has
"won,"
and
we
are
now
building
that
beautiful
"wall,"
and
this
powerful
border
wall
is
going
up
at
record
speed
and
we
just
reached
over
100
miles
of
"wall,"
and
by
next
"year,"
we'll
be
over
400
"miles,"
and
shortly
thereafter
it
will
be
complete.
a
lot
of
people
were
saying
a
year
"ago,"
"\"he"
didn't
build
the
wall
yet.
he
didn't
build
the
"wall.\""
let
me
tell
you.
when
you
have
the
strength
of
a
party
that
has
the
"house,"
"okay,"
hopefully
they're
not
going
to
have
the
house
for
long.
we'll
have
a
wonderful
new
"speaker,"
will
get
rid
of
nancy
"pelosi,"
nervous
"nancy,"
nervous
nancy.
we'll
have
kevin
mccarthy
who's
been
fantastic.
we
have
to
win
back
the
house.
but
think
of
this.
the
"wall,"
so
many
people
were
"saying,"
"\"build"
"it.\""
"well,"
it's
not
easy
when
you
have
the
weight
of
an
entire
party
and
they
control
the
"house,"
not
easy.
we
did
it
and
frankly
we
were
building
the
wall
through
the
help
of
the
"military,"
the
army
corps
of
engineers
"anyway,"
but
you
know
what?
now
we
actually
have
the
money
and
it's
going
up
very
rapidly.
in
all
due
respect
to
"mexico,"
we
like
mexico
very
"much,"
and
we've
gotten
along
great
with
"mexico,"
and
the
president's
a
friend
of
"mine,"
and
i
think
he's
doing
a
fantastic
job.
it's
a
tough
situation.
but
mexico
is
in
"fact,"
you
will
soon
find
"out,"
paying
for
the
wall.
okay?
they'd
hit
you
with
that.
now
the
wall
is
ultimately
and
very
nicely
being
paid
for
by
"mexico,"
and
it's
an
advantage
for
"mexico,"
"too,"
when
you
think
about
it.
the
wall
is
a
vital
barrier
for
blocking
deadly
drugs
from
pouring
into
these
communities.
what
we're
doing
is
stopping
drugs
at
a
record
number.
it's
still
anything
that
comes
over
is
too
"much,"
but
we're
blocking
it
at
a
record
number.
i'm
also
very
proud
to
report
that
we
won
a
critical
supreme
court
victory
yesterday
on
immigration.
we
will
now
be
finally
able
to
enforce
federal
"law,"
and
ensure
that
those
seeking
admission
to
our
country
are
able
to
support
themselves
financially
and
not
abuse
taxpayer
funded
programs.
they
were
killing
our
"country,"
killing
our
country.
washington
democrats
have
never
been
more
extreme
than
they
are
right
now.
"frankly,"
they're
crazy.
these
people
are
crazy.
they're
taking
their
cues
from
socialists
like
bernie.
left-wing
lawmakers
are
pushing
a
government
takeover
of
health
care
that
would
strip
180
million
americans
of
their
private
health
care
"plans,"
which
many
people
like.
the
plans
of
every
democrat
running
for
president
would
demolish
the
economy
of
new
"jersey,"
where
half
a
million
new
new
jersey
workers
are
employed
at
some
of
the
best
and
most
innovative
health
care
employment
companies.
we
have
them
working
at
the
"companies,"
and
we
have
people
getting
great
health
care.
it's
been
so
long.
it's
finally
working
and
they
want
to
destroy
it.
the
republican
party
will
never
let
it
happen.
we
are
saving
your
health
care
while
the
democrats
are
trying
to
take
away
your
health
"care,"
take
away
your
"doctors,"
take
away
all
of
the
good
care
that
we
"fought,"
and
we
fought
"hard,"
and
we're
doing
well
and
now
we're
doing
better.
by
the
"way,"
some
time
prior
to
the
end
of
the
"year,"
we're
putting
in
for
a
new
middle
income
tax
"cut,"
a
very
big
one.
but
we're
making
health
care
better
and
"much,"
much
cheaper.
we've
done
a
great
job
in
running
it
and
we've
given
you
a
lot
of
alternatives.
we
are
protecting
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
we
always
"will,"
the
republican
"party,"
pre-existing
"conditions,"
we
saved
it.
we
are
stopping
surprise
medical
billing
and
making
everything
transparent.
that's
a
big
"deal,"
and
that
will
take
effect
starting
in
about
two
months
from
now.
everything's
transparent.
you'll
be
able
to
see
pricing.
you'll
be
able
to
go
and
price
other
"hospitals,"
other
doctors.
it's
going
to
be
an
incredible
thing.
nobody
believes
i
was
able
to
do
"it,"
but
we
did
it.
we
are
defending
your
right
to
keep
the
doctor
and
the
plan
of
your
choice.
we
are
lowering
drug
prices.
the
democrats
are
increasing
drug
prices.
we
are
fighting
the
lobbyists
and
special
interests.
we
are
serving
you
and
how
are
we
doing?
we're
doing
"good,"
right?
but
because
of
price
"transparency,"
we
are
getting
it
done.
we're
approving
more
generic
drugs
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
our
country.
that
means
they
come
"in,"
"frankly,"
they're
just
as
good
as
the
big
"names,"
but
they
sell
for
80%
less
in
some
cases.
we
are
unleashing
innovation
to
cure
diseases
of
all
kinds.
we
are
cutting
out
the
rich
middlemen
and
delivering
prescription
drugs
directly
to
the
consumers.
these
are
all
things
that
we
had
to
fight
like
hell
to
get.
we're
making
less
paperwork
for
your
doctors
and
giving
you
easy
control
of
your
medical
"records,"
which
is
a
big
deal
for
a
lot
of
people.
we
are
prohibiting
hospitals
from
hiding
their
prices
and
charging
hidden
costs.
you
go
"home,"
you
"say,"
"\"oh,"
i'm
feeling
better.
the
doctor
was
"fantastic,\""
and
then
they
send
you
a
bill
for
"$25,000."
that's
the
end
of
that.
all
of
a
sudden
the
doctor
wasn't
so
"good,"
right?
we
are
making
companies
compete
for
your
business.
we
are
repealing
burdensome
taxes.
we
have
accomplished
more
than
any
president
in
the
first
three
years
of
their
term
by
"far,"
not
even
close.
we
have
provided
health
insurance
"options,"
60%
cheaper
than
"obamacare,"
and
we
have
historic
investments
in
treating
kidney
"disease,"
"hiv,"
pediatric
cancer
and
alzheimer's
disease.
we're
making
so
much
progress.
we
have
just
passed
a
thing
that
i
think
is
great.
i
never
understood.
for
45
"years,"
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
passed.
we've
just
passed
a
thing
called
right
to
try.
you
know
what
that
is?
"so,"
we
have
the
greatest
"doctors,"
the
greatest
"technicians,"
the
greatest
labs
in
the
"world,"
and
we'll
have
a
drug
that's
looking
"good,"
but
it's
going
to
take
five
more
"years,"
and
by
the
"way,"
we've
brought
the
timing
way
down
from
12
years
to
half
of
"that,"
but
it
takes
years
to
get
it
approved.
you
have
people
that
are
terminally
ill.
if
they
have
"money,"
they
go
to
"asia,"
they
go
to
"europe,"
they
go
all
over
the
world
looking
for
help.
if
they
don't
have
"money,"
they
go
home
and
they
die.
what
we
did
is
a
thing
called
right
to
try.
people
sign
something
and
they
don't
hold
the
country
responsible.
they
don't
hold
the
drug
company
responsible.
it's
called
right
to
"try,"
and
they
get
the
"newest,"
and
the
"best,"
and
the
latest
medicine
where
it's
looking
"good,"
but
you're
not
going
to
have
it
for
five
more
"years,"
and
you
know
why
they
didn't
do
it?
because
they
didn't
want
to
hurt
"anybody,"
except
the
problem
is
the
people
were
going
to
die
soon.
i
"said,"
"\"they're"
terminally
ill.
let
them
have
"it.\""
we
sat
down
with
a
great
group
of
"leaders,"
republican
"leaders,"
and
"honestly,"
we
had
some
bipartisan
support
and
we
got
it
done.
they've
been
tried
to
do
it
for
45
or
so
years.
we
got
it
done.
you
have
to
see
the
"results,"
and
i've
seen
some
of
the
results.
some
of
the
results
are
incredible.
we've
transformed
veteran's
health
"care,"
including
through
va
"choice,"
right?
va
choice.
for
48
years
they've
been
trying
to
get
veterans
choice.
i
thought
i
had
the
greatest
secret.
you
"know,"
i
haven't
been
doing
this
that
"long,"
so
four
years
"ago,"
i'm
campaigning
for
president.
everyone
"said,"
"\"no,"
he's
only
having
"fun.\""
"yeah,"
it's
some
fun.
this
is
a
lot
of
fun.
right?
but
for
45
years-
but
for
45
years
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
veteran's
choice.
so
i
come
back
one
"day,"
i
say
to
my
"people,"
"\"i"
have
the
greatest
idea.
i
am
so
"smart.\""
i
am
like
the
smart-
i
have
an
idea
because
the
veterans
are
waiting
online.
they're
waiting
online
for
two
"weeks,"
three
"weeks,"
four
"weeks,"
ten
weeks.
some
are
okay
and
they
end
up
being
terminally
ill
by
the
time
they
see
the
"doctors,"
too
long.
and
i
"said,"
"\"folks,"
i
have
the
greatest
"idea.\""
all
of
my
"people,"
i
"say,"
"\"i"
have
the
greatest
idea.
i'm
so
smart.
here's
what
we're
going
to
do.
we're
going
to
send
all
those
people
that
can't
see
a
"doctor,"
we
just
can't
get
them
to
see
a
doctor.
we're
going
to
send
them
down
the
road
to
private
doctors
and
we're
going
to
pay
the
bill
and
they're
going
to
get
fixed
"up.\""
right?
so
smart.
but
you
"see,"
i
said
i
was
smart
and
they
looked
back
at
me
and
they
"said,"
"\"sir,"
we've
known
about
that
concept
for
45
years.
we
just
can't
get
it
"approved.\""
but
i
got
it
approved.
and
i
got
it
approved
about
11
months
ago.
and
the
va
is
doing
fantastically
well.
our
veterans
are
doing
great.
that
was
a
big
thing.
that
was
a
big
thing.
we
also
got
accountability.
where
people
could
mistreat
our
"veterans,"
do
whatever
they
"want,"
they
could
be
sadistic.
they
could
be
so
many
other
things.
they
could
"steal,"
they
could
rob.
you
couldn't
do
"anything,"
you'd
keep
them.
you
couldn't
do
a
thing.
we
got
accountability.
now
you
look
at
"him,"
you
"say,"
"\"get"
the
hell
out
of
here.
you're
"fired,"
you're
fired.
now
you
can
fire.

let

"8,000"

have
reduced

deaths
for
the
first
"time,"

very
"substantially,"
in
30

and
we
are
modernizing
critical
vaccines.
we're
doing
a
great
job
with
vaccines.
we
are
creating
a
pathway
to
buy
drugs
from
"canada,"
that
are
"much,"
much
"cheaper,"
in
florida.
governor
ron
desantis
came
to
me.
he
"said,"
"\"sir,"
this
system
is
so
"bad.\""
and
you
can't
fix
it
unless
you
have
democrat
"votes,"
that's
why
you
got
to
vote

you
got
to
get

"say,"
"\"sir,"
we
can
buy

50%

this
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
no

has
wanted
to
do
it.
you
know
how
long
it
took
me
to
make
that
decision?

"said,"
"\"if"

i
gave

are
protecting

"want,"
and
you
know
"this,"

want
to

and
you
"know,"
we
all
have
a

all
have

when
you
tell
people
to
come
into

"country,"
like
this
clown
governor
of
"california,"
come
into
our

they're
all
going

they're
going

who
would
even
think
this?
virtually
every

also
now
supports
late

babies
straight
from

"womb,"
right
up

the
moment

and
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late
term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred

democrats
are
now
the

a
disaster.
they
don't

asking

one
of
the

moments.
it's
probably
the
greatest

in

the
2016

was
"probably,"
i
mean
you
could
"say,"
the
greatest
election
in
the

we
have
to
do

need
this

if
you
want
your

to
inherit
the
blessings
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
and
died
for
it

"secure,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
that
we
have
toward
victory
in

have
to.

by
the

when
we
talk

have

don't
leave
it
to

then
you
do
have
a
problem.
"no,"
i'm
only
kidding.
does
anybody
here
not
love
their
child
or
their

because
if
you
don't…
there's
one
man
raising
his
hand.
"nah,"
that's
a
big

save

hardworking
american
patriots
who
love
our
"country,"
cherish
our
"values,"
respect
our
laws
and
always
put
america
first.
eight
months
from
"now,"
we're
going
to
defeat
the
radical
socialists.
we're
going
to
win
the
great
state
of
north
carolina
in
a
landslide.
we
won
it
last
"time,"
we're
going
to
win
it
this
time
by
even
more.
and
you
"know,"
eric
and
lara
named
their
"daughter,"
you
know
what
her
name
is?
"carolina,"
carolina.
her
name
is
carolina
for
a
reason.
this
is
an
incredible
time
for
our
nation.
our
country
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
and
"today,"
we
just
had
the
largest
one
day
increase
in
the
stock
market
in
history.
that's
great.
that's
great.
that
was
great.
you
"know,"
our
opponents
were
"saying,"
"\""
"oh,"
maybe
he's
in
"trouble,"
maybe
the
economy
…
"\""
they'll
do
anything.
they'll
do
anything.
i'm
sure
they
were
thrilled.
do
you
think
our
opponents
were
thrilled
when
they
saw
the
stock
market
today?
i
don't
think
so.
by
the
"way,"
look
at
this.
look
back
"there,"
look
at
all
of
that
press.
look
at
all
them.
"man,"
i
don't
know
if
sleepy
"joe,"
or
"bernie,"
i
don't
think
they
have
that
much
press.
bernie
was
going
wild.
why
would
i
be
here
tonight?
why
would
i
be
here?
he
said
why
would
i
be
here
tonight?
we
don't
have
the
"primary,"
we've
already
won
the
"thing,"
you
know?
i
was
going
to
say
the
you
know
what
"thing,"
i
held
it
"back,"
because
they'll
"say,"
"\"horrible"
language.
he
used
horrible
language
"today.\""
but
we're
doing
fantastically.
there's
never
been
a
time
where
the
republican
party
was
so
unified
as
it
is
now.
"never,"
never.
and
you
hear
about
enthusiasm
for
crazy
"bernie,"
and
that's
"true,"
he
does
have
some
"enthusiasm,"
but
much
less
than
we
have
and
a
much
smaller
group
of
"people,"
too.
and
there's
not
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
for
biden.
i
thought
he
gave
up
the
presidency
the
other
day
because
he
said
he's
running
for
the
senate.
i
looked
at
the
first
"lady,"
i
"said,"
"\""
"hey,"
he's
running
for
the
"senate.\""
and
today
he
just
said
super
"thursday,"
he's
looking
forward
to
super
thursday.
jobs
are
booming
in
our
"country,"
incomes
are
"soaring,"
poverty
has
"plummeted,"
confidence
is
"surging,"
and
we
have
completely
rebuilt
the
awesome
power
of
a
thing
called
the
united
states
military.
every
"day,"
for
me
and
for
"you,"
it's
promises
"made,"
promises
kept.
one
of
the
most
important
promises
i
made
is
right
to
this
era.
you
"know,"
we
look
at
"it,"
it's
the
never
ending
wars
in
the
middle
east.
we're
taking
our
"soldiers,"
we're
bringing
them
back
home.
we're
not
law
enforcement.
we're
bringing
them
back
home.
american
troops
cannot
be
the
policemen
for
the
"world,"
or
to
create
democracy
in
other
nations
that
frankly
probably
don't
want
it.
the
job
of
the
american
military
is
to
secure
and
defend
our
country.
two
days
"ago,"
the
unites
states
signed
a
deal
with
the
taliban
so
that
after
19
years
of
"conflict,"
and
very
close
to
"20,"
we
can
finally
begin
to
bring
our
amazing
troops
back
home.
after
years
of
rebuilding
foreign
"nations,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
nation
and
taking
care
of
our
own
american
citizens
and
all
of
the
things
that
we've
"done,"
we've
wiped
out
the
"terrorists,"
we've
done
so
"much,"
and
you
know
what?
we're
"8,000"
miles
away.
you
got
a
lot
of
big
countries
surrounding
"afghanistan,"
you've
got
afghanistan
itself.
the
progress
that
was
"made,"
was
made
possible
by
the
extraordinary
valor
of
our
men
and
our
women
in
uniform.
you
know
that.
we
pay
a
special
"tribute,"
and
i
know
you
pay
"it,"
a
special
tribute
to
our
great
wounded
warriors
and
those
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
as
we
bring
back
our
"troops,"
we
are
committed
to
ensuring
that
foreign
terrorists
are
denied
admission
to
america
in
the
first
place.
they're
not
coming
"here,"
and
if
they
"do,"
bad
things
happen
to
them.
we
must
keep
radical
islamic
terrorists
the
hell
out
of
our
country.
by
the
"way,"
i
have
to
say
"this,"
you
know
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
outside.
somebody
was
saying
that
if
"pocahontas,"
any
one
of
"them,"
sleepy
"joe,"
he
doesn't
have
"that,"
so
he
doesn't
have
a
"lot,"
he
has
very
small
"crowds,"
but
if
sleepy
joe
or
if
any
of
them
had
a
crowd
one-tenth
this
"size,"
they
go
around
talking
about
how
big
the
crowd.
they
never
say
that.
"hey,"
take
your
cameras
and
spin
them
around
this
big
arena.
right
now.
spin
them
around.
no
fun
to
be
a
protestor
at
a
trump
"rally,"
but
do
we
have
a
great
time
at
a
trump
rally?
my
administration
has
also
taken
the
most
aggressive
action
in
modern
history
to
protect
americans
from
the
coronavirus.
you
know
about
this
whole
thing?
horrible.
"including,"
sweeping
travel
restrictions.
"today,"
we
met
with
the
big
great
pharmaceutical
"companies,"
and
they're
really
working
"hard,"
and
they're
working
"smart,"
and
we
had
a
great
meeting
today
with
a
lot
of
the
great
companies.
they're
going
to
have
vaccines
i
think
relatively
soon.
and
they're
going
to
have
something
that
makes
you
"better,"
and
that's
going
to
actually
take
place
we
think
even
sooner.
so
a
lot
of
good
things
are
"happening,"
but
we
have
strong
"borders,"
and
"really,"
our
tough
and
early
actions
have
really
been
proven
to
be
100%
right.
we
went
"out,"
we're
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
the
sick
and
infected
people
from
coming
into
our
country.
we're
working
on
that
very
hard.
we
closed
our
borders
very
early.
i
took
a
lot
of
heat
for
that.
remember
when
i
closed
the
borders
to
certain
areas
of
the
world?
i
took
a
lot
of
heat.
but
there
are
fringe
globalists
who
would
rather
keep
our
borders
open
than
keep
our
"infection,"
think
of
"it,"
keep
all
of
the
"infection,"
let
it
come
in.
and
we're
working
with
other
countries.
in
all
"fairness,"
"look,"
it's
a
"problem,"
we're
working
with
other
countries.
remember
"this,"
over
the
last
long
period
of
"time,"
the
"flu,"
the
common
"flu,"
you
know
"this,"
right?
from
"27,000"
to
"70,000"
people
get
"infected,"
and
many
people
die.
think
of
"it,"
"27,000."
you
lose
"27,000"
people
to
the
common
flu.
it
can
be
much
more.
one
year
was
much
higher
than
the
"70,000"
number.
those
people
died.
so
when
you
lose
"27,000"
people
a
"year,"
nobody
knew
that.
i
didn't
know
that.
"three,"
four
weeks
"ago,"
i
was
sitting
"there,"
i
"said,"
"\"what"
do
we
lose
with
the
regular
"flu?\""
they
"said,"
"\"about"
"27,000"
"minimum,"
goes
up
to
"70,"
sometimes
even
"80,"
one
year
it
went
up
to
"100,000"
"people.\""
i
"said,"
"\"nobody"
told
me
that.
nobody
knows
"that.\""
last
year
was
approximately
"36,000"
people
died.
so
we're
working
hard
on
"it,"
and
we're
going
to
come
up
with
some
really
great
solutions.
in
the
"meantime,"
we're
stopping
…
only
in
north
carolina.
only
in
north
carolina.
it
can
only
be.
how
many
people
here
are
from
south
"carolina,"
by
the
way?
all
"right,"
we
love
both
places.
but
that
was
from
north
carolina.
but
just
to
finish
"up,"
so
we've
made
a
lot
of
"progress,"
we've
really
done
a
great
job
with
it.
we're
keeping
our
borders
strong.
my
job
is
to
protect
the
health
of
american
patients
and
americans
"first,"
and
that's
what
i'll
do.
washington
democrats
are
trying
to
politicize
the
"coronavirus,"
denigrating
the
noble
work
of
our
public
health
professionals.
but
"honestly,"
not
so
much
anymore.
everyone
"appreciates,"
these
are
the
greatest
professionals
in
the
world
at
what
they
do.
we're
actually
helping
a
lot
of
other
countries
where
they
have
some
"very,"
very
big
problems.
so
we
have
our
professionals
in
constant
"touch,"
i'm
in
constant
touch
with
some
of
the
leaders
and
helping
them
out.
but
the
political
attacks
from
some
of
the
democrats
really
must
stop.
we've
got
to
all
work
together
on
this
one
to
safeguard
our
people.
we're
going
to
safeguard
our
"people,"
the
united
states.
the
united
states
"is,"
right
"now,"
ranked
by
far
number
one
in
the
world
for
preparedness.
earlier
"today,"
when
i
met
with
the
pharmaceutical
"companies,"
things
were
discussed
and
learned
honestly.
the
media
didn't
know.
nobody
knew.
they've
never
heard
this
before.
and
we
learned
a
"lot,"
and
maybe
that
had
the
impact
on
the
stock
market.
who
knows
what
"happened,"
but
we're
going
to
reduce
and
the
severity
of
what's
"happening,"
the
duration
of
the
virus.
we
discussed
all
of
these
things.
we
will
bring
these
therapies
to
market
as
rapidly
as
possible.
and
i
have
to
"say,"
with
a
thriving
economy
the
way
it
"is,"
and
the
most
advanced
health
system
on
"earth,"
america
is
so
"resilient,"
we
know
what
we're
"doing,"
we
have
the
greatest
people
on
"earth,"
the
greatest
health
system
on
earth.
we
have
the
greatest
health
system
on
earth.
the
renewal
of
american
strength
over
the
last
three
years
means
at
times
of
"challenge,"
we
are
the
best
prepared
to
rise
to
any
occasion.
no
country
is
better
equipped
than
america
to
handle
new
"threats,"
and
no
people
are
more
"skilled,"
"talented,"
"tough,"
or
driven
than
americans.
and
"together,"
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
american
comeback.
that's
what
it
is.
last
"month,"
we
added
"225,000"
new
jobs
in
january
alone.
that
makes
seven
million
jobs
since
the
election.
we
have
destroyed
the
isis
territorial
"caliphate,"
and
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
"isis,"
al-baghdadi.
he
is
dead.
and
we
took
out
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
qasem
"soleimani,"
ending
his
evil
reign
on
terror
"forever,"
soleimani.
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
time
with
vile
hoaxes
and
delusional
witch
"hunts,"
we
have
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
and
lifting
up
american
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"religion,"
"color,"
and
creed.
"tomorrow,"
voters
in
states
across
the
nation
will
head
to
the
polls
for
super
"tuesday,"
not
super
thursday.
"no,"
he
"said,"
"\"super"
"thursday.\""
you
can't
do
these
things.
can
you
imagine
if
i
said
super
thursday?
it
would
be
"over,"
right?
i
would
be
over.
no
matter
how
good
you
are
at
certain
"things,"
you
"can't,"
as
an
"example,"
a
name
like
sleepy
"joe,"
he's
constantly
naming
the
wrong
state.
"\"it's"
great
to
be
in
the
state
of
"ohio.\""
"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
i'm
"sorry,"
you're
in
north
carolina.
"no,"
no.
joe!
do
you
ever
see
them
run
up
with
a
"sign,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
north
"carolina,"
"joe!\""
once
that
"happens,"
you
might
as
well
leave
the
"states,"
because
it's
a
disaster
no
matter
how
good
you're
doing.
we're
in
north
carolina!
it's
great
to
be
in
idaho!
"no,"
you're
in
iowa.
"nah,"
he
makes
a
lot
of
those
"mistakes,"
they're
a
little
scary?
we're
going
to
protect
your
second
"amendment,"
you
understand
that.
but
did
you
"see,"
sleepy
"joe,"
did
you
see
sleepy
"joe,"
where
he
"said,"
"\"last"
"year,"
150
million
people
were
killed
by
guns
in
our
"country.\""
150
million!
that
means
50%
of
our
country.
that's
a
big
story.
150.
can
you
imagine
trump
saying
that?
these
people
would
never
let
me
live
it
down.
we
can't
make
even
a
little
mistake.
we
can't
make
even
a
"little,"
"tiny,"
tiny
mistake.
if
we
make
a
tiny
"mistake,"
it's
headlining.
they
say
things
like
150
million
people
"killed,"
"guns,"
they
say
super
"thursday,"
they
say
"georgia,"
he's
looking
forward
to
winning
georgia
tomorrow.
georgia's
not
in
super
tuesday!
so
many
mistakes!
you
can't
do
that
when
you're
negotiating
with
china.
can't
do
that
when
you're
negotiating
with
these
"countries,"
can
you?
those
mistakes
would
be
very
tremendous.
then
you
have
mini
mike.
you
see
this
guy?
can
you
believe
it?
mini
mike.
he's
being
interviewed
tonight
on
fox.
can
you
believe
it?
fox.
they
want
to
be
politically
correct.
they
want
to
"interview,"
they
end
up
interviewing
more
democrats
than
republic
…
i
don't
know
what's
going
on
with
fox.
but
they're
interviewing
this
guy
the
night
before
…
mini
"mike,"
"ay,"
"ay,"
"ay,"
what
a
mess
he
is.
the
worst
debate
performance
in
the
history
of
presidential
debate
history.
the
worst
in
history.
"nah,"
i
got
to
have
more.
i'd
get
down
real
"low,"
but
i
don't
want
to
copy
him.
everybody
saw
it.
everyone
"said,"
"\"oh,\""
they
all
"say,"
"\"oh!"
do
that
again
where
you
get
down
"low.\""
but
if
i
do
that
"again,"
it's
a
copy.
it's
a
copy!
"no,"
no.
no.
you
never
like
to
"copy,"
even
though
you're
copying
yourself.
you
don't
like
to
copy.
you
do
it
once.
it
was
a
big
hit.
but
you
do
it
"once,"
and
you
sort
of
"say,"
"\"that"
was
"nice,"
don't
do
it
"again,\""
because
if
it
doesn't
work
the
second
"time,"
it
gets
"embarrassing,"
right?
right?
we
all
know.
but
"no,"
he's
a
disaster
waiting
to
happen.
he's
a
mess.
no
matter
which
democrat
candidate
you're
talking
"about,"
and
you
understand
"that,"
any
one
of
these
candidates
…
and
you
see
what's
"happening,"
right?
it's
being
rigged
against
…
it's
sad.
it's
being
rigged
against
crazy
bernie.
crazy
bernie
is
going
to
go
crazy.
crazy.
i
think
crazy
bernie
is
going
to
be
more
crazy
when
they
see
what
they're
doing.
i
called
it
a
long
time
ago.
mayor
pete
"buttigieg,"
"buttigieg,"
may
"pete,"
he
quit.
out
last
night.
then
i
hear
a
senator
from
a
state
we're
going
to
"win,"
we're
going
to
win
that
"state,"
but
she
dropped
out.
sounds
like
they
made
a
deal.
they
both
supported
sleepy
joe.
you
know
why?
they
made
a
deal.
you
know
why?
quid
pro
"quo,"
that's
why.
don't
care.
quid
pro
quo.
quid
pro
"quo,"
they
made
a
deal.
impeach
them!
they
should
be
impeached!
they
should
be
impeached!
quid
pro
quo.
but
they've
embraced
an
extreme
left
wing
agenda.
their
plans
would
massively
raise
your
"taxes,"
destroy
our
"liberty,"
muzzle
our
"faith,"
and
erase
our
sovereignty.
you
know
that.
the
democrat
party
has
gone
crazy.
whether
it's
bernie
sanders
plan
to
eliminate
private
"healthcare,"
elizabeth
pocahontas's
plan
…
by
the
"way,"
she's
history.
she's
history.
i
came
up
with
that
name
far
too
"early,"
i
should've
just
waited.
but
it
didn't
matter.
i
thought
she
was
making
a
come
back.
i
"said,"
"\"wow,"
i
just
did
it
to
"her.\""
but
you
know
those
embers
were
burning
a
little
bit
a
couple
of
months
ago?
they
never
caught
on.
in
"fact,"
she'll
probably
lose
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
bernie.
so
she
doesn't
know
what
to
do
because
you're
not
supposed
to
lose
the
state
of
massachusetts
if
you
get
in
there.
she's
the
senator.
she's
the
senator
for
"massachusetts,"
i
think
she's
going
to
lose
it
to
bernie.
and
miss
"michigan,"
you
see
what's
going
on
over
there?
"michigan,"
we're
leading.
we're
leading
in
wisconsin.
we're
leading
in
florida.
we're
leading
in
the
last
election.
"hey,"
how
great
was
the
2016
election?
one
of
the
greatest
"nights,"
one
of
the
most
highest
rated
television
nights
in
the
history
of
television.
and
"remember,"
there
was
"oh,"
this
is
going
to
be
a
quick
one.
this
is
going
to
be…
"oh,"
that
wasn't
so
easy
for
them.
i
love
the
scene.
the
scene
of
that
convention
center
where
hillary
was
getting
ready
to
"speak,"
and
then
she
found
out
she
lost.
but
elizabeth
warren's
here
to
plan
to
eliminate
our
"borders,"
or
mini
mike's
plan
to
eliminate
your
second
amendment.
mike
bloomberg
wants
to
eliminate
your
second
amendment.
don't
worry
about
"it,"
it's
not
going
to
happen.
not
going
to
happen
for
him.
for
sleepy
"joe,"
he
doesn't
even
know
where
he
"is,"
what
he's
"doing,"
or
what
office
he's
running
for.
"actually,"
i
honestly
don't
think
he
knows
what
office
he's
running
for.
and
it
doesn't
matter.
maybe
he
gets
"in,"
because
he's
a
little
more
moderate.
so
maybe
he
gets
in.
but
he's
not
going
to
be
running
it.
other
people
are
going
to.
they're
going
to
put
him
into
a
"home,"
and
other
people
are
going
to
be
running
the
country.
but
they're
going
to
be
super
left
radical
crazies.
they're
going
to
be
super
left
radical
"crazies,"
joe's
going
to
be
in
a
home.
he'll
be
watching
television.
everything
will
be
just
fine.
the
insanity
of
washington
democrats
is
why
millions
of
registered
democrat
voters
are
joining
our
movement.
they
are
joining
our
great
republican
party.
we
have
the
enthusiasm
in
our
party.
"no,"
i
really
mean
it.
i
constantly
hear
about
the
enthusiasm.
they're
fighting
each
"other,"
they
hate
each
"other,"
they
don't
know
what's
going
on.
we
have
all
the
"love,"
we
have
all
the
"enthusiasm,"
and
we
know
what
we're
doing.
we
know
what
we're
doing.
so
we're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
many
really
"great,"
"terrific,"
"brilliant,"
wonderful
warriors.
even
though
he
comes
from
a
slightly
different
"state,"
but
not
to
far
"by,"
is
somebody
that
really
has
distinguished
"himself,"
he's
become
a
great
friend
of
mine.
what
he
did
for
justice
"kavanaugh,"
do
you
remember
that?
one
of
the
greatest
statements
ever
made
in
the
united
state's
"senate,"
senator
lindsey
graham.
come
on
"up,"
lindsey.
lindsey
"graham,"
come
on
"up,"
lindsey.
come
"here,"
lindsey.
i
got
to
have
him
say
"something,"
come
"here,"
"lindsey,"
great
guy.
they
handle
pressure
so
well.
they
came
and
we
gave
a
rally
that
was
like
this
and
dan
bishop
and
gregg
murphy
won
by
so
"much,"
it
wasn't
even
close.
they're
great
"people,"
and
they've
done
a
fantastic
job.
thank
you
very
much.
they
handle
pressure.
they
were
under
a
lot
of
"pressure,"
they
handled
it
well.
it's
nice
to
know
people
can
handle
"pressure,"
there
aren't
too
many
of
them.

we
love

you
know
the
first

a
long
time
ago
"now,"
right?
how
long
is
that?
probably
almost
almost
five
years
"ago,"
she
"said,"
"\"there"
are
these
two
women
on
the
"internet,"
they're
unbelievable.
they're
"unbelievable.\""
i
"said,"
"\"oh,"
i
"know,"
i
hear
that
all
the
time.
i
hear
it
all
the
"time.\""
she
"said,"
the
next
day
she
came
again.
she
"said,"
"\"i"
saw
them
"again,"
they're
"unbelievable.\""
i
"said,"
"\"let"
me
"see.\""
i
saw
"them,"
i
fell
in
love
with
"it,"
and
everybody
fell
in
love
with
diamond
and
silk.
so
thank
you.
some
people
that
have
really
been
helpful
to
"me,"
corey
"lewandowski,"
david
"bussey,"
and
pam
"bondi,"
right
here.
thanks
also
to
all
of
the
people
who
are
working
to
make
the
2020
republican

right
here
in
charlotte
an
outstanding
"success,"

chairman
ronna

rnc
co
chairman

and
convention
president
marcia
lee
"kelly,"
thank
you
all.
you're
doing
a
great
"job,"
i'll
tell
you
they're
"looking,"
they're
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
doing
a
good
job.
should
we
doing
a
great
"job,"
but
just
an
okay
job?
it
doesn't
matter
as
long
as
you
win.
you
know
what
i
gave
when
we
won
last
"time,"
somebody
else
took
them
to
convention
"center,"
spent
a
fortune
and
i
just
took
a
hotel
ballroom.
i
"said,"
"\"what"
the
"heck,"
if
i
"win,"
nobody
"cares,"
if
i
"don't.\""
look
if
you
"win,"
nobody
cares
what
room
you're
in.
if
you
"lose,"
nobody
cares
what
room
you're
in.
so
we
took
a
"ballroom,"
nice
"ballroom,"
that's
"it,"
no
big
deal.
i
think
it
this
"way,"
if
we
"win,"
nobody
cares.
and
if
we
"lose,"
i'm
out
of
"there,"
i
save
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money.
every
place
that
we've
"gone,"
it's
been
amazing.
i'd
also
like
to
"recognize,"
so
"important,"
a
woman
who's
really
helped
us
win
north
carolina
in
"2016,"
i
have
a
feeling
this
"year,"
she'll
even
do
"better,"
because
she
happened
to
grow
up
"here,"
lara
trump
and
my
son
eric
trump.
two
great
people.
i
mean
i
have
to
say
that
about
my
"son,"
but
i
know
a
lot
of
people
don't
like
their
sons
that
"much,"
but
lara
has
been
"fantastic,"
and
thank
you
very
"much,"
what
a
job.
she
knows
this
state
better
than
anybody
in
this
room
except
maybe
this
guy
right
here.
how
are
we
"doing,"
lara?
how
are
we
doing?
how
are
we
doing
in
the
"state,"
are
we
doing
good?
and
we're
doing
well
in
pennsylvania
i
"hear,"
and
south
"carolina,"
i
know
we're
doing
great
there.
also
with
us
"tonight,"
is
a
man
who's
really
become
a
good
friend
of
mine.
we
were
going
at
it
a
little
bit
at
the
"beginning,"
but
i
will
tell
"you,"
and
i
would
say
if
i
didn't
get
"along,"
i
would
not
be
here.
i
wouldn't
do
this.
i
think
he's
been
tremendous.
he's
been
a
tremendous
supporter
and
things
that
we've
wanted
to
"do,"
and
fights
that
we've
had
which
were
so
"important,"
he's
been
right
"up,"
and
lizzie
will
tell
you
that
he's
been
right
up
in
front
and
really
he
deserves
another
six
year
term.
probably
a
lot
longer
than
"that,"
but
he's
going
to
come
up
and
i'm
going
to
ask
senator
thom
"tillis,"
come
on
up.
thom
has
really
been
"incredible,"
he's
been
working
everyday.
and
he
really
wants
to
fight
to
the
radical
left
and
he
does
it
and
he
knows
how
to
"fight,"
and
take
care
of
our
amazing
"veterans,"
and
stop
illegal
immigration.
thom
is
the
champion
for
the
people
of
north
carolina.
this
"november,"
we
need
everybody
to
go
and
vote
for
"thom,"
he's
doing
great.
he's
doing
great.
i
hear
he's
way
up
in
the
"polls,"
he's
way
up
in
the
polls.
"thom,"
say
a
few
words.
"\"get"
me
off
this
stage.
get
me
off.
you
guys
didn't
tell
me
this
was
going
to
"happen.\""
"no,"
that
was
great
thom.
we're
also
honored
to
be
joined
tonight
by
a
true
american
"hero,"
a
veteran
of
world
war
ii
and
the
korean
war
who
just
turned
100
years
old.
his
name
is
george
washington
"perry,"
legit.
"george,"
thank
you
very
much
for
being
here.
thank
"you,"
george.
100
years.
he's
100
and
he
looks
good.
thank
"you,"
george.
with
the
help
of
everyone
here
"tonight,"
america
has
now
become
the
hottest
economy
anywhere
on
the
planet
earth.
since
my
election
over
"219,000"
new
jobs
have
been
created
right
here
in
north
carolina.
we
have
lifted
"10,000,000"
people
off
of
"welfare,"
including
"7,000,000"
people
off
of
food
stamps.
median
household
income
has
reached
the
highest
level
ever
"recorded,"
think
of
that.
the
average
unemployment
rate
from
my
administration
is
the
lowest
for
any
us
president
in
recorded
"history,"
that's
"happening,"
that's
happening.
the
unemployment
rate
among
african
"americans,"
hispanic
"americans,"
and
asian
americans
has
reached
the
lowest
level
in
recorded
history.
very
important
to
"me,"
african
american
youth
unemployment
has
reached
an
all
time
low.
african
american
poverty
is
that
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded.
for
decades
democratic
politicians
"betrayed,"
and
they
truly
"did,"
they
betrayed
african
americans.
my
administration
is
delivering
for
african
americans
like
never
before.
no
president
has
done
more
for
our
black
"community,"
no
president
has
done
more
for
our
black
"community,"
and
it's
an
honor
to
do
it.
last
month
here
in
"charlotte,"
we
launched
a
nationwide
campaign
to
create
a
better
future
for
all
americans.
it's
called
opportunity
"now,"
you
know
about
it.
we're
also
fighting
to
ensure
that
working
families
have
access
to
paid
family
"leave,"
reducing
the
cost
of
childcare
and
giving
"40,000,000"
american
families
an
average
of
"$2,200"
thanks
to
the
republican
child
tax
credit.
the
republicans
are
claiming
that
we
did
that
nobody
else
"did,"
but
the
democrats
are
"saying,"
"\"how"
did
they
do
that
"one?\"."
the
usmca
is
a
giant
for
north
carolina's
incredible
farmers
and
factory
workers.
and
by
the
"way,"
speaking
of
"farms,"
factory
"workers,"
and
small
"businesses,"
are
all
for
the
death
tax.
you
know
about
the
death
"tax,"
right?
it's
called
the
inheritance
tax.
you
have
a
small
farm
some
"place,"
you
have
a
small
"business,"
you
have
a
nice
"business,"
you
no
longer
have
an
inheritance
tax
or
a
death
tax.
so
if
you
want
to
leave
it
to
your
"children,"
you
can
leave
it
to
your
"children,"
there's
no
tax
to
be
paid
by
your
children.
so
they
don't
have
to
go
back
to
the
evil
"banker,"
borrow
money
from
the
"banker,"
lose
the
"farm,"
lose
the
"business,"
it
won't
happen.
and
i
always
"say,"
i
know
a
lot
of
parents
that
don't
love
the
children
very
much.
is
there
anybody
in
this
room
that
does
not
love
your
children?
please
raise
your
hand.
please
raise
your
hand.
nobody.
"nobody,"
that's
because
we're
north
"carolina,"
you
love
your
children.
but
if
you
"don't,"
then
it
doesn't
matter
because
if
you
don't
love
your
"children,"
don't
leave
them
a
damn
"thing,"
but
you
don't
have
the
inheritance
tax
"anymore,"
which
is
great.
a
lot
of
people
don't
even
know
"that,"
but
that's
a
big
deal
or
no
issue
have
washington
democrats
more
thoroughly
betraying
the
american
people
than
on
the
issue
of
immigration
sanctuary
"cities,"
which
release
dangerous
criminals
to
terrorize
your
communities.
right
here
in
north
"carolina,"

it

"not,"
the
sanctuary

of

released
an

these

now
we
got

you
think
that's

have
done

you
have
to.
we've
added
catch
and
"release,"
one
of
the
worst
loopholes
you've
ever
"seen,"
catch
and
release.
you
catch
them.
you
then
"say,"
"\"where"
do
you
"live?\""
they
don't
know
because
"look,"
let's
face
"it,"
they
don't
know.
i
understand
that.
it's
not
even
to
be
laughed
at.
they
don't
know.
"\"where"
do
you
"live?\""
i
don't
know.
"mexico,"
"maybe,"
"honduras,"
"guatemala,"
who
knows?
el
salvador.
"\"where"
do
you
"live?\""
like
this
"guy,"
he's
a
mexican.
you're
about
as
mexican
as
i
am.
look
at
this
guy.
he's
as
mexican
as
i
am.
look
at
that
hat.
are
you
mexican?
are
you
mexican?
"no,"
you're
not.
are
you?
he
is.
it's
like
elizabeth
warren.
she
said
she
was
an
indian.
i
"said,"
"\"i"
have
more
indian
blood
in
me
than
you
"have,"
and
i
have
none.
she
"said,"
"\"oh,"
this
is
"terrible.\""
so
she
went
out
and
got
a
test
and
it
turned
out
not
so
good
for
her.
right?
"1024th,"
right?
one
"thousandths,"
so
i
was
right.
i
probably
have
more
in
me.
what
a
phony
she
is.
what
a
phony.
washington
democrats
have
never
been
more
extreme.
132
congressional
democrats
have
signed
up
for
bernie
sanders'
healthcare
takeover.
while
the
washington
democrats
are
trying
to
destroy
your
healthcare
and
your
social
"security,"
and
they
are
going
to
destroy
your
social
security.
remember
they
used
to
say
with
"me,"
"\"i'm"
going
to
end
it
the
first
"day.\""
"well,"
you
know
"what,"
we're
going
to
soon
be
four
years
and
all
i've
done
is
make
it
stronger.
you
know
that.
my
administration
is
protecting
your
social
"security,"
your
"medicare,"
and
is
fighting
to
give
you
great
healthcare.
you're
going
to
have
great
health.
we
are
defending
your
right
to
keep
the
doctor
and
to
keep
the
plan
of
your
choice.
remember
president
obama?
you
can
keep
your
doctor.
you
can
keep
your

28
times.
they
"said,"
"\"impeach"
him.
you
should
impeach
"him.\""
28
times
he
lied.
28
times
on
"record,"
"\"you"
can
keep
your
"doctor,"
you
can
keep
your
"plan.\""
"well,"
that's
not
true.
it
wasn't.
impeach
him.
we're
making
healthcare
better
and
much
cheaper
while
premiums
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
five
years
before
i
took
office.
we
are
now
offering
plans
that
are
up
to
60%
less
expensive
and
they're
better
plans.
we
are
protecting
people
with
preexisting
conditions
and
we
always
"will,"
and
we
are
trying
"terminate,"
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
"states,"
the
worst
healthcare
in
the
"world,"
and
we
are
going
to
give
you
the
best

you've
ever
seen
at
a
low

we're
fighting
to
stop
surprise
medical
billing.
you
know
what
that
is?
surprise.
you
get
all
sorts
of
surprises.
we
have
people
that
take
a
blood
test
in
one
"place,"
it's
"$26,"
and
in
another
place
it's
$2000.

maybe
the
cheap
one
is
"better,"
who
knows?

it's
wrong.

building.
bombed.
out.
billing.
i
signed
an
executive
order
opposing
price
transparency
that's
going
to
be
bigger
than
"healthcare,"
because
when
providers
are
required
to
show
their
"prices,"
those
same
prices
fall
"very,"
very
fast.
right?
it's
a
big
thing.
it's
a
big
thing.
we've
approved
a
record
number
of
affordable
new
generic
"drugs,"
which
are
just
as
good
as
name
brand
"drugs,"
but
a
fraction
of
the
cost.
we
have
given
"them,"
and
there's
a
lot
of
political
pressure
not
to
do
"that,"
you
can
understand
why.
to
care
for
our
amazing
"veterans,"
we
passed
va
choice
and
va
"accountability,"
and
nobody
said
it
could
be
done.
so
"now,"
instead
of
waiting
in
line
for
days
and
"days,"
and
weeks
and
weeks
to
see
a
"doctor,"
you
go
"outside,"
you
get
a
"doctor,"
we
pay
the
"bill,"
you
get
all
fixed
up.
what
a
great
thing.
it's
called
va
choice.
i
got
it
done.
they've
been
trying
to
pass
it
for
almost
50
years
and
they
haven't
been
able
to.
those
people
over
there
were
a
great
help.
we
have
passed
the
spectacular
right
to
try.
you
know
what
that
is?
hopefully
nobody
in
the
room
needs.
hopefully
nobody
in

we
are
combating
the
opioid
epidemic.
drug
overdose
deaths
have
declined
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
31
years.
we've
launched
new
initiatives
combating
kidney
disease
and
"alzheimer's,"
and
we're
pursuing
new
advances
in
neonatal
research
to
care
for
america's
youngest
"patients,"
and
breaking
all
records
in
so
doing.
virtually
every
democratic
candidate
has
declared
their
unlimited
support
for
extreme
late
term
"abortion,"
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
"womb,"
right
up
until
the
very
moment
of
birth.
how
about
that?
that
is
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
late
term
abortion
of
"babies,"
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
of
god.
then
you
have
the
governor
of
virginia.
the
baby
is
born.
the
baby
is
born
and
he
"says,"
"\"and"
then
you
go
over
and
start
talking
to
the
mother
as
to
whether
or
not
you
execute
the
"baby.\""
this
is
the
governor
of
virginia.
the
governor
of
virginia.
he's
a
beauty.
you
remember
what
he
did?
he
wanted
to
dance
like
michael
jackson
and
his
wife
stopped
him.
he
got
lucky.
but
the
governor
of
virginia
wanted
to
do
that.
the
baby
is
born
and
then
he
goes
over
and
talks
to
the
mother.
the
doctor
will
now
"talk,"
and
you'll
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
baby
lives.
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
like
this?
the
democratic
party
is
the
party
of
high
"taxes,"
high
"crime,"
unlimited
"regulations,"
open
"borders,"
late
term
"abortion,"
"socialism,"
blatant
"corruption,"
and
the
total
obliteration
of
your
second
amendment.
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
the
american
"worker,"
the
american
"family,"
the
american
"dream,"
and
the
late
great
abraham
lincoln.
so
many
people
came
up
to
me
tonight
and
they
want
me
to
"fight,"
and
we're
doing
it
for
school
"choice,"
so
that
every
child
who
needs
"it,"
gets
it.
no
parent
should
ever
be
forced
to
send
their
child
to
a
failing
government
school.

we

this

not

by
anyone
other
than

i
recognized
israel's
true

and

the

our

listen
to
this
one.
no

going
to
this.
they
don't
even

they
don't

do
you
think
that
a
guy
like
sleepy
joe's
going
to
"put,"
he
doesn't
know
what
it
means.
i
know
what
i
means.
we
have
to
have
a
strong
military.
we
have
the
strongest
military
we've
ever
had.
when
i
came
"in,"
our
military
was
in
sad
shape.
it
was
"depleted,"
but
we've
rebuilt
"it,"
$2.5
trillion
dollars
went
into

is
the
actual
survival
of
an
our

itself.
if
you
want
your
children
to
inherit
the
blessings
of
generations
of
americans
who
fought
and
died
to
"secure,"
and
you
know
what
they're
"securing,"
they
are
securing
"us,"
they're
securing
our
"freedom,"
then
we
must
devote
everything
we
have
toward
victory
in
"november,"
november

to
be
exact.
only
this
way
can
we
save
the
america
we
"love,"
and
drain
the
washington
"swamp,"
which
is
by
the
"way,"
much
more
"vicious,"
much
"dirtier,"
much
deeper
than
i
ever
"thought,"
but
we
are
kicking
ass.
with
your

we
will
lift
billions
more
of
our
citizens
from
welfare
to
"work,"
dependence
to
"independence,"
and
poverty
to
prosperity.
together
we
will
elect
a
republican

we
will
continue
with
the
great
thom

we
will
get

"thom,"
i
don't
think
anybody
even
wants
to
run
against
"you,"
"thom,"
but
we're
going
to
reelect
thom

is
that
right?
we're
going
to
reelect
thom

if
we
"don't,"
i'm
going
to
be
so
angry
at

than

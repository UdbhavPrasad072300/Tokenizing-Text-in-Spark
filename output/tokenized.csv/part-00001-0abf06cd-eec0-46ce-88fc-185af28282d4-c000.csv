"[hello,"
"manchester,"
and
i
am
thrilled
to
be
in
the
great
state
of
new
hampshire
with
thousands
of
hardworking
patriots
who
believe
in
"god,"
"family,"
and
country.
thank
you.
thank
you.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
—
we
have
more
in
this
"arena,"
and
i
hate
to
say
this
to
you…
we
have
more
than
this
outside
of
the
arena
trying
to
get
in.
so
if
you'd
like
to
give
up
your
seat
or
where
you're
standing…
sorry
we
couldn't
get
you
"seats,"
but
if
you
want
to
give
it
"up,"
let
them
come
"in,"
you
go
out.
does
anybody
want
to
make
that
deal?
i
don't
think
so.
but
we
have
more
in
this
arena
and
outside
of
this
arena
than
all
of
the
other
"candidates,"
meaning
the
"democrats,"
put
together
and
multiplied
times
fave.
and
the
fake
"news,"
these
guys
will
never
report
that.
they'll
never
report
it.
they
don't
even
like
showing
the
crowd.
they
always
show
my
face.
they
never
show
the
crowd.
but
you
know
what?
the
people
can
hear
the
crowd.
the
people
can
hear
the
crowd.
they
know.
that
is
not
the
sound
of
200
people.
one
of
their
prime
candidates
"today,"
they
worked
a
big
deal.
they
had
exactly
104
"people,"
and
the
fake
news
"said,"
"\"it"
was
a
nice
crowd.
very
"nice.\""
if
i
had
one
empty
seat
"here,"
one
empty
seat
in
this
massive
"arena,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"he"
didn't
sell
"out.\""
but
you
know
what?
we
have
never
had
an
empty
seat
from
the
day
your
future
first
lady
and
i
came
down
the
escalator.
"never,"
not
one
time.
and
we
have
the
biggest
arenas
in
the
country.
with
your
help
on
november
3rd
we
are
going
to
defeat
the
radical
socialist
democrats.
we
are
going
to
win
new
hampshire
in
a
landslide.
this
is
a
truly
incredible
time
for
america.
we
have
the
best
economy
we've
ever
"had,"
the
most
prosperity.
we
have
got
the
most
prosperity
we've
ever
had.
by
the
"way,"
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
"way,"
"too,"
if
it's
"okay,"
who
was
"mumbling,"
very
"distracting,"
very
distracting.
it's
true.
you
"know,"
it
was
very
distracting.
i'm
speaking
and
a
woman
is
mumbling
terribly
behind
"me,"
angry.
there
was
a
little
anger
back
there.
we're
the
ones
that
should
be
"angry,"
not
them.
we're
the
ones
that
should
be
"angry,"
but
we
proudly
declared
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
great
american
comeback.
our
country
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before.
and
the
day
after
my
"address,"
our
good
republicans
in
the
united
states
senate
voted
to
reject
the
outrageous
partisan
impeachment
hoax
and
to
issue
a
"full,"
"complete,"
and
"absolute,"
total
acquittal.
and
it
",wasn't"
even
close
and
i
want
to
thank
our
republican
senators
and
our
republican
house
members.
they
were
tremendous.
in
the
"house,"
we
won
196
to
nothing
and
then
we
got
three
democrats.
and
in
the
"senate,"
other
than
"romney,"
we
got
52
to
"nothing,"
52
to
nothing.
that's
"something,"
and
in
one
case
we
got
53
to
"nothing,"
but
i
don't
even
count
that
to
be
honest.
the
radical
left's
pathetic
partisan
crusade
has
completely
failed
and
utterly
backfired
with
18
votes…
think
of
that…
18
votes
to
"spare,"
with
a
lot
of
votes
to
spare.
and
also
very
"importantly,"
as
of
"today,"
i…
"we,"
because
it's
not
we.
it's
not
i.
it's
we.
we're
all
in
this
together.
we
have
the
highest
poll
numbers
that
we
have
ever
had.
thank
"you,"
"nancy,"
very
much.
thank
you.
while
the
extreme
left
has
been
wasting
america's
time
with
this
vile
"hoax,"
we've
been
killing
"terrorists,"
creating
"jobs,"
raising
"wages,"
enacting
fair
trade
"deals,"
securing
our
"borders,"
and
lifting
up
citizens
of
every
"race,"
"color,"
"religion,"
and
creed.
from
our
rural
communities
to
our
"cities,"
we
are
expanding
the
blessings
of
america
to
all
of
our
citizens.
we
added
another
"225,000"
new
jobs
last
month
alone.
amazing.
and
i
listened.
i
watched.
i
had
all
these
experts.
they
were
"saying,"
"\"yes,"
i
think
"60,000.\""
another
one
said
"101,000."
another
one
said
125.
another
one
was
118.
and
then
the
number
came
"out,"
"225,000."
pretty
good.
pretty
good.
we
have
destroyed
the
isis
caliphate.
we
killed
the
founder
and
leader
of
isis.
al-baghdadi
is
dead.
al-baghdadi
is
"dead,"
and
we
just
took
out
the
world's
top
"terrorist,"
qasem
"soleimani,"
ending
his
evil
reign
of
terror
forever.
the
fact
"is,"
america
is
respected
again.
it's
been
a
long
time.
but
as
we
keep
on
"winning,"
washington
democrats
keep
on
losing
their
minds.
they're
crazy.
that's
why
millions
of
registered
democrat
voters
are
leaving
their
party
to
join
our
movement.
they're
joining
our
great
republican
party.
"now,"
i
can't
tell
you
what's
happening
tomorrow
because
you
know
you
have
some
pretty
strange
election
laws
"here,"
right?
remember
last
time?
we
won
the
primary
tremendously.
we
should
have
won
the
"election,"
but
they
had
buses
being
shipped
up
from
"massachusetts,"
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
buses.
and
it
was
"very,"
very
close
even
though
they
"did,"
but
this
year
we
have
a
great
"governor,"
governor
sununu.
great
"governor,"
chris.
and
now
you
get
prosecuted
if
you
do
what
they
"did,"
so
it
should
be
a
lot
different.
but
we
have
done
great.
this
has
been
an
incredible
state
for
us.
it's
a
state
where
the
people
are
"great,"
just
great
people.
and
we
hear
that
there
could
be
because
you
have
crossovers
in
"primaries,"
don't
you?
so
i
hear
a
lot
of
republicans
tomorrow
will
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
possible
of
the
democrats.
does
that
make
sense?
you
people
wouldn't
do
that.
my
only
problem
is
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
their
weakest
candidate?
i
think
they're
all
weak
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth.
we
proudly
welcome
and
embrace
voters
of
all
parties
and
political
persuasions
who
want
to
join
our
mission.
a
very
simple
"mission,"
remember?
make
america
great
again.
and
then
after
we
make
it
great
"again,"
which
we
already
have…
we've
had
141
days
where
the
stock
markets
have
reached
their
all-time
historical
high.
"141,"
think
about
it.
out
of
three
"years,"
141.
and
to
"me,"
i
view
it
differently.
"well,"
look
at
your
401ks.
i
"mean,"
who
is
doing
well
with
their
401k?
up
90%.
up
104%.
is
there
anybody
doing
badly
with
the
401k?
i'd
like
to
not
talk
to
that
person.
does
anybody
have
a
401k
where
they're
doing
"badly,"
please?
"oh,"
don't
put
up
your
hand.
i
don't
believe
it.
"nah,"
the
"401ks,"
they're
up
"90%,"
95%.
i
always
tell
this
story.
people
come
up
to
me.
they
"say,"
"\"i"
want
to
thank
you.
my
wife
thinks
i'm
a
total
"loser,"
sir.
she
thinks
i
am
the
worst
person
with
"money,"
with
financial.
she
thinks
i'm
just
horrible.
in
the
last
three
"years,"
i'm
up
"94%,"
sir.
she
thinks
i'm
a
total
genius
when
it
comes
to
finance.
she
loves
me
again.
she
didn't
love
me
"before,"
sir.
she
loves
me
"again.\""
that
tells
you
something
about
"money,"
doesn't
it?
the
first
step
to
victory
in
november
is
tomorrow.
go
send
a
message
that
republicans…
and
you
can
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
if
you
want.
don't
worry
about
it.
i
don't
really
think
we
actually
have
a
candidate
against
us…
that
republicans
are
"energized,"
that
we're
"united,"
and
that
nine
months
from
now
we
are
going
to
take
back
the
house
of
representatives.
we
are
going
to
hold
the
senate
and
we
are
going
to
keep
the
white
house.
you
"know,"
they
always
talk
about
the
democrats.
they
have
"enthusiasm,"
right?
we
have
so
much
more
enthusiasm
than
them.
it's
not
even
close.
they're
all
fighting
each
other.
they're
all
going
after
each
other.
you
got
them
all
over
the
place.
they
don't
know
what
the
hell
they're
doing.
they
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
they
can't
even
count
their
votes.
we're
thrilled
to
be
joined
tonight
by
many
great
leaders
from
across
this
state
and
this
"country,"
great
national
leaders.
i
want
to
thank
our
tremendous
vice
"president,"
mike
"pence,"
who
spoke
earlier
this
evening.
and
also
with
"us,"
our
warrior
"senators,"
the
two
people
that
wanted
to
be
here.
they're
going
to
be
here
tomorrow.
they're
going
to
be
here
to
get
out
the
vote.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
too
much
about
"it,"
but
that's
okay…
and
very
highly
"respected,"
senators
lindsey
graham
and
rand
paul.
great
guys.
"warriors,"
they're
warriors.
"hey,"
lindsay
and
rand.
that's
not
bad.
can
you
imagine
if
you
actually
came
from
new
hampshire
what
it
would
be?
right?
that's
not
"bad,"
but
they
have
been
great.
all
they
do
is
they
looked
at
everybody
for
the
last
couple
of
months
and
they
"said,"
"\"read"
the
transcripts
please.
read
the
"transcripts.\""
but
i
want
to
thank
you
both
very
much.
two
great

got
to
tell
you.

used
to
be
big.

so
much
anymore.

very
brave
man…

took
a
bullet.
he
got
shot
and

up.

was
going
to
die
that
night.
i
tell
this
story
all
the
time.
his
"wife,"
she
was
crying
so
much.
when
he
finally
did
"awake,"
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
one
thing
i
"learned,"
your
wife
loves
"you.\""
"\"why"
do
you
say
"that?\""
"\"because"
she
was
"devastated.\""
i
know
many
wives
that
don't
get
too
upset.
his
wife
was
devastated.
his
family
was
devastated.
the
doctor
told
me
he
didn't
have
a
good
"chance,"
but
he's
tough
as
hell
and
he's
a
really
terrific
friend.
he's
a
winner.
he
put
himself
back
into
shape.
he
actually
looks
better
now
than
he
did
before
he
got
shot.

of

china's
entrance

"wto,"
the
world
trade
"organization,"
one
of
the
truly
bad
deals
ever
made
in
the
history
of
our
country.
for
"decades,"
politicians
campaigned
across
this
state
promising
to
replace
nafta.
they
lied.
they
never
did
it.
they
never
even
tried
to
do
it.
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
anyway.
it
wasn't
"easy,"
i
will
tell
you
that.
but
then
they
got
elected
and
they
did
absolutely
nothing.
but
i'm
not
like
those
other
politicians.
i
keep
my
promises.
we
took
care
of
it.
we
took
care
of

you

we
ended
the

catastrophe
and
i
signed

that's
going
to
be
great
for
our
"manufacturers,"
our

for
everybody.

for
our
workers.

bring

back
to

where

should
have
never

probably
the
number

reason
i
ran
for
office.
i'm

i
have
friends.

of
these
great
"senators,"

at

over

and
look
at

these
great
senators.
"sure,"
i've
run
five
times
and
i've

"\"i"
won

i've
won
five
of
those
damn
"contests.\""
i
"said,"
"\"senator,"
i
ran
once
and
i
won
just
"once.\""
and
we're
going
to
run
twice
and
that's
going
to
be
it.
although
they
think
we're
going
to
run
much
more
than
"that,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
it
scares
the
hell
out
of
the
fake
"news,"
i
will
tell
you.
they
can't
take
a
joke.
i
also
took
the
strongest
ever
action
to
confront
china's
massive
theft
of
american
"jobs,"
and
our
strategy
worked.

and
tariff

is
pouring
in
and
has
poured
"in,"
poured
in
by
the
billions
and

we
never
took
in
25
cents
from
china.
they
ripped
us
so
much
you
wouldn't
believe
it.
now
they
respect
us
again.
last
month
we
signed
a
groundbreaking
trade
agreement
with
china
that
will
defeat
so
many
of
our
opponents.
the
money
that's
pouring
"in,"

don't
even
believe
it.
and
by
the
"way,"
the
"virus,"
they're
working
hard.
looks
like
by
"april,"
in
theory
when
it
gets
a
little
"warmer,"
it
miraculously
goes
away.
i
hope
that's
"true,"
but
we're
doing
great
in
our
country.
"china,"
i
spoke
with
president
xi
and
they're
working
"very,"
very
hard
and
i
think
it's
going
to
all
work
out
fine.
rough
"stuff,"
i
tell
you.
"rough,"
rough
"stuff,"
but
i
think
it's
going
to
work
out
good.
we
only
have
11
cases
and
they're
all
getting
better.
but
our
trade
agreement
with
china
will
defend
our
"workers,"
protect
our
intellectual
"property,"
and
substantially
boost
exports
of
american
made
goods.
is
that
nice?
after
years
of
building
up
other
"countries,"
we
are
finally
rebuilding
our
country.
on
no
issue
of
washington
democrats
more
thoroughly
sold
out
the
american
people
than
a
thing
called
"immigration,"
right?
before
i
came
into
"office,"
the
far
left's
policy
of
open
borders
allowed
deadly
drugs
to
flow
freely
into
our
country
and
that's
what
they
want.
i
see
them
campaigning
right
down
the
street.
it's
really
boring
to
"watch,"
but
i
try
and
watch.
"no,"
i
have
an
obligation
to
watch
really
boring
stuff.
but
they
want
open
borders.
they
want
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
to
pour
into
our
"country,"
many
of
whom
are
not
exactly
what
we're
looking
"for,"
okay?
i
mean
"murderers,"
"rapists,"
and
some
other
things.
they're
going
to
be
poisoning
our
children
with
"drugs,"
including
right
here
in
new
"hampshire,"
and
you
have
one
of
the
drug
problems
in
the
country.
and
we
brought
it
down
18%
but
we
have
to
do
better.
18%.
washington
democrats
put
the
needs
of
illegal
immigrants
before
the
wellbeing
of
american
citizens.
they
want
to
let
anyone
into
our
country
from
all
around
the
world.
just
come
on
"in,"
"folks,"
we're
going
to
give
you
free
healthcare.
we're
going
to
give
you
free
education.
we're
going
to
give
you
more
than
our
vets
are
getting.
every
family
will
get
a
free
rolls
royce.
you
know
i
said
"that,"
matt.
i
said
that
to
them
and
some
of
the
fake
news
picked
it
up
and
they
"said,"
"\"president"
trump
said
every
family
coming
into
our
country
illegally
gets
a
brand
new
free
rolls
royce.
he
lied.
he
lied.
he
"lied.\""
they
gave
me
a
pinocchio.
they
don't
get
"it,"
"matt,"
do
"they,"
matt?
actually
they
get
it
better
than
we
understand.
they
get
it
very
well.
they
get
it.
they
know
what's
happening.
and
the
wall
is
being
built.
i
will
tell
you
the
wall
is
being
built.
and
you
know
they
went
after
us
on
everybody
knows
the
wall
is
going
up.
so
what's
happening?
you
do
know
who's
paying
for
the
"wall,"
don't
you?
right.
redemption
from
illegal
aliens
that
are
coming.
the
redemption
money
is
paying
for
the
wall.
they're
so
sad
to
hear
that
because
it's
"okay,"
"finally,"
they
go.
you
have
to
understand
an
entire
party
is
fighting.
they'll
give
me
anything
i
want.
our
military
would
rebuilt
it.
"2.2,"
it's
really
$2.5
trillion
over
a
period
of
three
years.
they
give
me
anything
but
not
25
cents
for
the
wall.
they
"said,"
"\"we"
like
"drones.\""
"well,"
drones
don't
keep
people
out.
drones
are
wonderful.
they
fly
"around,"
take
pictures.
we're
going
to
give
you
a
drone.
no
good.
so
we
now
have
built
over
100
miles
of
wall.
and
when
we
have
that
wall
"built,"
you
have
to
see
what
happens
to
the
illegal
aliens
that
don't
come
in.
i
say
they
can't
come
in.
they
don't
come
in.
so
we
up
to
over
a
"hundred,"
substantially
more
than
a
hundred
miles
of
"wall,"
and
we'll
have
close
to
500
miles
of
wall
in
the
very
near
future.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
have
to
see.
you
wouldn't
believe
it.
you
have
to
see
what
happens
when
that
wall
goes
up.
you
have
to
see
the
numbers
change
like
magic.
they
change
like
magic.
you
ever
hear
the
thing
with
all
the
modern
"technology,"
all
of
the
new
"computers,"
the
new
"genius,"
the
new
"everything,"
cyber
"this,"
cyber
"that,"
two
things
never
"change,"
right?
a
wheel
and
a
wall.
right?
a
wheel
and
a
wall.
they're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
brilliant
people
working
over
the
years.
they're
never
going
to
replace
the
wheel
and
they're
never
going
to
replace
the
"wall,"
and
it's
a
high
wall.
illegal
immigrants
coming
"in,"
coming
into
our
country
"illegally,"
very
few
of
them
are
getting
in
right
now.
mexico
has
been
terrific.
we
have
"27,000"
mexican
soldiers
on
our
border
and
the
numbers
went
down
87%
from
this
year
and
this
time
last
year.
and
for
the
amount
of
money
washington
democrats
want
to
spend
supporting
illegal
"immigrants,"
we
could
rebuild
the
cities
in
america.
we
could
rebuild
our
cities.
but
i
have
"something,"
because
people
were
screaming
to
me
for
the
last
four
or
five
"rallies,"
read
the
snake.
the
snake.
does
anybody
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
she
knows.
she's
been
standing
outside
for
four
"days,"
no
wonder.
and
you
look
"good,"
i'll
tell
you
what.
four
days
outside
in
the
rain
and
snow.
look
at
these
front
row
people.
these
are
warriors.
they're
warriors
"too,"
like
my
congressmen
and
senators.
i
made
minor
changes.
they
mentioned
illegal
immigration.
this
is
about
immigration.
this
was
a
song
from
the
"1950s,"
al
green.
and
they
mentioned
little
changes
to
"it,"
that's
okay.
but
they
mentioned
illegal
"immigration,"
right?
and
i
used
to
do
this
a
lot
and
people
couldn't
get
enough
of
"it,"
to
be
honest
with
you.
and
i
haven't
done
it
for
a
"while,"
and
i
thought
i'd
do
it
tonight
because
you're
on
the
eve
of
giving
us
an
opponent
and
all
of
these
people
want
open
borders.
they
want
open
"borders,"
and
we
don't
want
open
borders.
we
want
very
strong
closed
borders.
and
we
want
people
to
come
into
our
"country,"
but
they
want
to
come
in
through
merit
and
we
want
them
to
come
in
"legally,"
right?
right?
through
merit
and
legally.
right?
so
we'll
do
this
quickly.
this
is
illegal
immigration.
it's
called…
"oh,"
listen
to
how
quiet
it
is.
listen
to
how
quiet.
now
watch
how
quiet
it
gets.
gets
so
quiet.
but
this
is
all
about…
i
love
you
too.
that
was
a

said
"that,"

i
love

i
love

so
important.
illegal
immigration.
on
our
way
to
work
one
morning
down
the
path
along
the
"lake,"
a
tender
hearted
woman
saw
a
poor
half
frozen
snake.
his
pretty
colored
skin
had
been
all
frosted
with
the
dew.
"\"poor"
"thing,\""
she
"cried,"
"\"i'll"
take
you
in
and
i'll
take
care
of
"you.\""
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven's
sake.
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
the
vicious
snake.
she
wrapped
him
up
all
cozy
in
a
comforter
of
silk
and
laid
him
by
her
fireside
with
some
honey
and
some
milk.
she
hurried
home
from
work
that
night
and
as
soon
as
she
"arrived,"
she
found
that
pretty
snake
she'd
taken
in
had
been
"fully,"
fully
revived.
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven
sake.
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
that
vicious
snake.
she
clutched
him
to
her
bosom.
"\"you're"
so
"beautiful,\""
she
cried.
"\"but"
if
i
hadn't
brought
you
in
by
"now,"
you
truly
would
have
"died.\""
she
stroked
his
pretty
skin
again
and
kissed
him
and
held
him
tight.
but
instead
of
saying
thank
"you,"
the
snake
gave
her
a
vicious
bite.
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
take
me
in
for
heaven's
sake.
take
me
"in,"
oh
tender
"woman,"
sighed
the
vicious
snake.
"\"i"
saved
"you,\""
cried
the
"woman,"
"\"and"
you've
bitten
"me,"
but
why?
you
know
your
bite
is
poisonous
and
now
i'm
going
to
"die.\""
"\"shut"
"up,"
silly
"woman,\""
said
the
reptile
with
a
grin.
"\"you"
knew
damn
well
i
was
a
snake
before
you
took
me
"in.\""

to
come

banned
sanctuary
cities
in
your
state.
and
by
the
"way,"
you
have
a
great
"governor,"
chris
sununu.
he's
on
top
of
it.
he's
on
top
of
it.
and
his
father
is
a
great
guy.
his
father
didn't
like
me
too
much
a
few
years
ago.
once
i
"won,"
i'm
telling
"you,"
he
was
so
good.
he
was
as
good.
he
fought
like
hell
for
"us,"
all
of
us.
it's
a
great
"family,"
and
chris
is
doing
a
fantastic
job.
if
you
want
to
shut
down
sanctuary
"cities,"
if
you
want
to
protect
your
family
and
your
loved
"ones,"
you
must
vote
republican
in
"2020,"
november.
and
thanks
to
our
tireless
efforts
to
secure
the
"border,"
we
have
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
eight
straight
months
in
a
row.
illegal
crossings
are
down
now
at
record
numbers
and
we've
ended
catch
and
release.
you
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
you
catch
an
illegal
alien
by
law.
you
then
take
his
name
and
address.
they
don't
have
addresses.
what's
your
address?
what?
they
don't
have
addresses.
they
come
into
the
"country,"
they
don't
have
addresses.
so
you
take
his
name
and
then
you
have
to
release
him
into
the
country
and
you
"say,"
"\"we'll"
see
you
in
four
years
for
your
court
"case.\""
we
never
see
them.
they
never
come
back.
we
have
seized
record
amounts
of
drugs.
we
have
deported
record
numbers
of
gang
"members,"
ms-13
by
the
thousands.
and
we
have
done
more
to
secure
the
border
of
our
country
than
any
administration
in

we
got

the
most

in
the

we
had
to

not
to
have

you
paid
a
fortune
not
to
pay

for
bad
healthcare.
and
we
got
rid
of
"it,"
saved
a
lot
of
money
for
a
lot
of
people.
and
we're
stopping
surprise
medical
bills
and
making
everything
transparent.
that's
bigger
than
healthcare

and
that'll
go
unfortunately
into
effect
right
around
the

give

that's
happened.

never
really
had
a

they'd
get
"out,"
they
couldn't

they'd
go

they'd
go
back
to
their

i
"mean,"
in
many
cases
i
guess
they
had
no
choice.
it
was
a
disaster.
now
they're
getting
out
and
because
our
economy
is
so
good
and
because
of
what
we've
done
with
criminal
justice
reform

other
things

out
here

let's
drain
the

will
elect
a
republican

create
a
"fair,"
"sane,"

lawful

will
continue
to
enact
new
trade
deals
that
result
in
more

i'm
thrilled

we
will
have
people
coming
into
our
country
that
never
even
thought
of
it
before.
you
get
free
"education,"
you
get
free
"healthcare,"
why
wouldn't
they
come?
let's
go
to
america.
the
biden
plan
would
unleash
a
flood
of
illegal
immigration
like
the
world
has
never
seen.
it's
crazy.
biden's
plan
is
the
most
"radical,"
"extreme,"
"reckless,"
"dangerous,"
and
deadly
immigration
plan
ever
put
forward
by
a
major
party
candidate.
it
must
be
"defeated,"
and
it
will
be
defeated
on
november
3rd.
it
will
be
defeated.
at
last
night's
democrat
"convention,"
which
by
the
"way,"
got
very
bad
"ratings,"
i
have
to
tell
you.
unity.
they
talk
about
unity.
they
want
to
bring
unity.
and
then
you
listen
to
michelle
obama's
"speech,"
which
was
obsolete
by
the
time
it
got
there.
she
taped
it.
"no,"
she
taped
the
speech.
it
was
obsolete.
she
must
have
taped
it
about
three
weeks
before.
i'm
speaking
next
"thursday,"
maybe
i'll
tape
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
goes.
that's
so
much
"nicer,"
to
tape
"it,"
you
do
"it,"
nice
air
conditioned
room.
and
she
not
only
taped
"it,"
but
tell
me
when
you
hear
a
divisive
speech…
they
talk
about
me
as
being
a
divider.
i'm
not
a
divider.
i
bring
people
together.
we
were
bringing
people
together.
we
were
bringing
people
"together,"
like
never
before.
success
was
bringing
everyone
"together,"
and
then
we
got
hit
with
the
china
"virus,"
but
we
were
bringing
people
together.
but
one
of
the
opening
speakers
last
night
said
that
america
will
go
to
hell
if
we
don't
have
open
borders.
think
of
that.
go
to
hell.
when
a
country
doesn't
have
"borders,"
you
don't
have
a
country.
"today,"
a
democrat
speaker
at
the
convention
"said,"
"\"we're"
talking
about
abolishing
the
"police,"
we're
talking
about
abolishing
"ice,"
we're
talking
about
abolishing
"prisons.\""
biden's
campaign
has
turned
into
a
cult
for
open
border
and
others
zealots.
by
the
"way,"
they
want
to
double
and
triple
your
"taxes,"
they
want
to
increase
"regulations,"
they
want
to
spend
very
little
money
on
our
"vets,"
after
we
took
care
of
our
vets
better
than
anyone's.

and
they
want
to
spend
much
less
on
our
"military,"
we've
totally
rebuilt.

half

"dollars,"
we've
totally
rebuilt

bernie
sanders
"declared,"
in
his
"speech,"
many
of
the
ideas
that
just
a
few
years
ago
were
considered
"radical,"
are
now
mainstream.
that's
bernie
sanders.
because
"joe,"
he
doesn't
know
where
he
is.
but
if
he
"did,"
he's
been
brought
so
far
left
that
our
country
will
not
be
the
country
that
we
know.
it
will
have
"problems,"
it
will
go
down.
your
stocks
will
be
"gone,"
your
401ks
will
disappear.
and
right
"now,"
who
has
the
401k?
and
then
the
rest
of
"you,"
many
of
you
have
"stocks,"
and
you
do
it
a
different
way.
that
will
go
down
"50,"
"60,"
"70%,"
80%.
and
if
you
held
"on,"
like
i
said
to
"do,"
we
went
down
a
little
while
we
got
hit
with
a
virus.
"now,"
nasdaq
just
broke
an
all

"snp,"
just
broke
an

socialism
is
the
mainstream
of
the
biden
campaign
and
it's
not
the
mainstream
of
america.
remember
i
"said,"
we
will
never
have
a
socialist
country.
on
november
3rd.
the
people
of
"arizona,"
our
great
"state,"
we
love
arizona.
i
won
it
last
"time,"
by
a
lot.
and
i
hear
we're
going
to
win
it
by
even
more
this
time.
don't
"forget,"
last
time
i
"talked,"
i
said
we're
going
to
give
you
a
tax
"cuts,"
i
gave
you.
i
"said,"
we're
going
to
give
you
a
massive
regulation
cuts.
give
you
your
tax
"cuts,"
i
gave
them
to
you.
i
said
we're
going
to
give
you
massive
regulation
"cuts,"
we're
going
to
give
you
great
everything.
we
even
did
right
to
try
medicine.
you
know
all
about
that.
we
did
things
that
i
didn't
even
talk
about
"it,"
we
did.
we
did
a
thing
called
the
space
force.
you
never
heard
me
talking
about.
i'm
the
only
candidate
that
gave
you
more
than
i
promised
in
the
campaign.
it's
true.
i'm
the
only
one
"ever,"
maybe
ever.
or
we'll
head
to
the
polls
and
together
we'll
stop
the
left
and
win
four
more
years
in
the
white
house.
we're
joined
today
by
some
incredible
"people,"
friends
of
"mine,"
"great,"
great
people.
and
i
want
to
congratulate
your
governor
because
we
had
a
spike
and
he
knocked
that
spike
out
so
fast.
i
don't
know.
are
you
sure
you
even
had
a
spike?

a
great
"governor,"
great
"man,"
and
a
somebody
that
won
by
about
16
or
17
points.
that's
not
so
bad.
and
i
think
you're
more
popular
today.
what
a
job
you've
done.
thank
you
very
"much,"
doug.
a
friend
of
mine
and
somebody
who's
a
great
fighter
"pilot,"
and
i
had
a
lot
of
people
tell
me
she
could
really
wheel
the
"warthog,"
right?
the
warthog.
she
"said,"
"\"i"
love
that
"plane,\""
but
she
was
a
"great,"
great
fighter
"pilot,"
one
of
the
best
they
were
telling
me.
this
was
a
group
and
they
knew
a
very
well.
a
lot
of
friends
you
have.
and
specifically
she
"said,"
"\"could"
you
extend
that
plane?
that's
the
best
plane.
it
never
breaks
down.
it
just
is
a
"winner.\""
but
martha
mcsally
is
an
extraordinary
"person,"
and
she's
fighting
for
"us,"
and
she's
helping
"us,"
and
we
have
to
bring
her
into
the
center.
thank
"you,"
martha.
and
she's
running
against
a
gentlemen
who
"is,"
when
you
read
what
he's
"done,"
when
you
read
what
he
said
about
the
second
amendment
and
about
all
other
"things,"
you're
not
going
to
want
to
vote
for.
you're
not
going
to
want
to
have
them
play
with
your
second
amendment.
i'll
tell
you
what.
if
i
weren't
"president,"
i
don't
"believe,"
"doug,"
you'd
have
a
second
amendment
right
now.
i
don't
think
you'd
have.
the
pressure
that
was
put
on
to
get
rid
of
"it,"
or
to
basically
obliterate
"it,"
make
it
so
it's
meaningless.
you
will
always
have
the
right
to
bear
arms.
you
will
always
have
that.
a
few
friends
of
mine
who
are
warriors.

paul.
where's
paul?
"paul,"
stand
up.
will
you?
paul
gosar.
thank
"you,"
paul.
appreciate.
great
job
you're
doing.
these
are
warriors.
they
really
are.
when
they
went
and
they
tried
to
make
a
play
at
your
"president,"
they
had
to
get
through
the
house.
what
were
we?
197
and
nothing.
that's
never
happened
before.
everybody
came
together.
the
republicans
came.

one
half
a

another
friend
of

and
incredible
"fighter,"
and
somebody
that
loves
his
"state,"
and
i'll
tell
"you,"
the
freedom
"caucus,"
right?
and
we
have
a
man
named
andy
biggs
here.
he's
a
fighter.
he's
a
fighter.
and
he
loves
our
"vets,"
and
he
loves
our
"military,"
and
you
love
our
second
"amendment,"
right?
and
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
with
it.
they
will
destroy
that
second
amendment.
just
remember
i
said
"it,"
but
you're
not
going
to
have
to
worry
about
it
because
it's
not
going
to
happen.
a
woman
who
really
distinguished
"herself,"
she
became

she
became

star
overnight.
there
was

was

better

"job,"

thank
you.
we
want

on

right
fellas?
we
got
to
have
her
on
our
side.
"also,"
thanks
to
arizona
republican
party
"chairman,"
i
knew
this
was
going
to
happen.
i
knew
that
she
was
going.

never

never
gives
up.

great
job
you're
doing.
are
we
winning?
"okay,"
good.
i
think
we
are.
that's
what
they
say.
we
better
win.
if
we
don't
"win,"
this
country
is
in
big
trouble.
big
trouble.
also

great
friend
of
all
of

treasurer
of

thank
you
jeff.
and
a
man
who
didn't
choke
under
pressure.
i
don't
even
know
if
he's
here.
i
think
he
might
be
here.
he
never
choked.
he
kicked
for
11
years.
you
know
what
that
is?
you
ever
see
a
golfer.
they
miss
a
three
footer.
they
miss
a
three
footer.
they
can't
take
it
back.
they
"choke,"
"choke,"
choke.
"well,"
kickers
are
the
same.
right?
nfl
kickers.
this
guy
lasted
11
years.
he's
one
of
the
best
kickers
ever.
nfl
"kicker,"
jay
feely.
where's
jay?
where
is
jay?
he's
here
someplace.
where
is
he?
jay?
what
happened?
you
couldn't
get
a
good
"seat,"
jay.
i
remember
the
61
yarder.
that
was
a
heartbreaker.
right?
but
the
only
thing
"is,"
i'll
bet
you
this
man
would
"stand,"
only
"stand,"
for
our
national
anthem.
that's
one
thing.
that's
one
thing
i
can
tell
you.
and
if
they
don't
stand
for
our
"flag,"
if
they
don't
stand
for
our
national
"anthem,"
i
turn
off
the
game.
other
than
"that,"
i'd
like
to
"watch,"
but
i
turn
off
the
game.
and
by
the
"way,"
i
thought
they
learned
that
lesson
a
little
while
ago.
i
thought
they
learned
that
lesson
two
years
"ago,"
but
maybe
"not,"
but
they
will.
they'll
learn
it
again.
this
time
it'll
go
even
faster.
for
"decades,"
washington
politicians
like
biden
allowed
an
endless
supply
of
illegal
foreign
labor
to
decimate
american
jobs
and
wages.
"also,"
the
crime
was
incredible
what
happened.
they
allowed
criminal
gangs
to
"menace,"
maim
and
terrorize
innocent
citizens.
they
came
in.
they
would
maim
and
"terrorize,"
and
we
have
done
something
with
our
border
patrol.
and
by
the
"way,"
"ice,"
ice
is
great.
ice
has
taken
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
"ms-13,"
and
you
don't
want
the
job.
there's
some
tough
people
here.
none
of
you
want
the
job.
it's
a
tough
"job,"
but
they
like
"it,"
and
they're
great
"patriots,"
and
they've
done
a
fantastic
job.
they
ceded
control
of
the
border
to
the
most
dangerous
and
ruthless
cartels
on
earth.
this
is
what
would
happen.
they
have
ceded.
and
what
we've
"done,"
did
you
ever
notice
the
caravans?
what
happened?
"debbie,"
there
are
no
more
caravans.
what
happened?
what
happened
to
the
caravans?
they
don't
come
up
anymore.
the
caravans
don't
come
up.
you
"know,"
we
were
paying
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
"honduras,"
"guatemala,"
el
"salvador,"
hundreds
of
millions.
and
i
"said,"
"\"well,"
why
are
we
doing
"that?\""
and
they
wouldn't
take.
when
we
caught
a
murderer
and
we
wanted
to
bring
it
back
to
one
of
those
"countries,"
they
wouldn't
take
him.
and
they
wouldn't
take
him
under
the
obama
administration.
so
we
got
stuck
with
them
because
they'd
fly
in.
they'd
"say,"
"\"don't"
land
your
"plane.\""
and
i
said
something
very
simple.
i
"said,"
"\"that's"
okay.
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
anymore.
we
stopped
"payment.\""
we
stopped
payment.
it's
amazing
how
that
"works,"
doug.
right?
we
stopped
payment
and
they
called.
they
"said,"
"\"we'd"
love
to
take
them.
we'd
be
honored
to
take
"them.\""
so
we
take
them
back
by
the
"thousands,"
by
the
thousands.
they
let
lethal
poisonous
drugs
pour
freely
into
our
schools
and
our
"communities,"
but
no
more.
it's
not
happening
anymore.
the
cruel
and
heartless
portrayal
of
the
american
people
ended
the
day
i
took
the
oath
of
"office,"
and
now
that
we
have
more
than
half
of
the
wall
"built,"
and
do
you
notice
they
don't
talk
about
the
wall
anymore.
they
don't
talk.
why
don't
you
talk?
i
"went,"
"\"look"
at
all
those
people
back
"there.\""
that's
called
fake
"news,"
fake
news.
look
at
them.
it's
the
fake
news.
they
don't
talk
about
the
wall
anymore.
"see,"
we
won.
we
got
the
wall.
it's
going
to
be
up
to
300
next
week
and
it's
going
to
be
finished
very
soon.
and
as
soon
as
we
"want,"
all
of
a
"sudden,"
they
never
talk
about
it.
but
you
know
where
i
talk
about
it?
numbers.
the
numbers
are
so
good.
the
numbers
are
so
low.
we've
never
had
numbers
like
this
because
that
big
portion
of
wall
already
"built,"
you
don't
get
through
it.
you
can't
get
through
it.
you
can
climb
mount
"everest,"
and
you're
going
to
have
an
awful
hard
time
getting
over
that
sucker.
i
stood
up
to
the
lobbyists.
everybody
fought
"us,"
the
"democrats,"
everyone.
i
fought
the
special
interests.
i
kept
every
single
promise
that
i
"made,"
and
now
i'm
doing
it
with
the
drug
companies.
i
just
created
favorite
nation.
so
if
a
nation
buys
it
for
less
and
they
buy
it
for
a
fraction
of
what
we
"pay,"
the
drug
companies
have
to
sell
it
to
us
for
the
same
price.
and
they're
spending
so
much.
they're
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
advertising.
anytime
you
see
an
ad
from
a
drug
"company,"
and
they're
"rich,"
the
"farmer,"
it's
called
big
"farmer,"
the
number
one
lobbyist.
they
spend
millions
and
"millions,"
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
online.
anytime
you
"see,"
anytime
at
"all,"
you
see
an
ad
by
big
farmer
against
"me,"
you
know
your
drug
prices
are
coming
down.
that's
what
it
is.
they're
not
happy.
and
we're
giving
the
rebate
that
creates
tremendous
wealth
for
the
middle
"man,"
the
rebate.
it's
going
to
the
people
now.
we're
bringing
the
rebate
and
it's
going
to
the
people.
they
are
not
happy.
i
have
a
lot
of
people
in
that
industry
do
not
like
me
too
much.
but
you
are
going
to
get
50.
you
are
going
to
"get,"
and
the
democrats
would
never
do
"it,"
biden
would
never
do
it
because
he
doesn't
understand
"it,"
but
they
would
never
do
it.
they
would
in
a
million
"years,"
they
wouldn't
do
it.
it
took
a
lot
of
guts
to
do
it.
i
had
a
lot
of
"people,"
a
lot
of
good
politicians
"go,"
"\"sir,"
i
don't
think
you
should
do
"it.\""
i
wonder
why
you're
saying
"that,"
but
we
did
it.
we're
going
to
have
drug
prices
reduced
over
a
very
short
period
of
"time,"
by
not
"2%,"
and
last
year
they
went
down
a
little
"bit,"
first
time
in
51
years
that
drug
prices
went
down
but
a
little
"bit,"
we're
going
to
have
prices
dropping
"50,"
"60,"
and
even
70%.
drugs.
about
time.
and
i'm
proud
to
say
that
they've
achieved
the
most
secure
"border,"
our
border
"patrol,"
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
of
america.
we
now
have
the
most
secure
border
we've
ever
had
and
it's
only
going
to
get
better.
and
we
want
people
to
come
"in,"
but
we
want
them
to
come
in
through
"merit,"
right?
and
we
want
people-
…
people
to
come
"in,"
but
we
want
them
to
come
in
through
"merit,"
right?
and
we
want
people
that
are
going
to
come
in
and
are
going
to
love
for
our
"country,"
not
hate
our
country.
here
in
"yuma,"
"arizona,"
we've
invested
over
$1.7
billion
and
poured
"180,000"
cubic
"yards,"
that's
a
lot
of
"concrete,"
to
build
108
miles
of
powerful
border
wall.
i
know
who's
going
to
vote
for
me.
i
don't
know
"though,"
i
think
i'm
going
to
win
yuma.
what
do
you
"think,"
doug?
i
"think,"
when
i
hear
those
"numbers,"
when
we
hear
those
"numbers,"
we're
winning.
we're
going
to
win
yuma
big.
now
you
see
it
and
you
see
what's
going
up
and
it's
an
incredible
"structure,"
all
"capable,"
all
wired
up
for
"cameras,"
for
everything
you
can
have.
technology
is
incredible.
in
"total,"
i've
already
completely
planned
for
the
final
"execution,"
we're
going
to
"have,"
by
the
end
of
the
"year,"
everything
that
we
said
is
going
to
be
built.
we
may
actually
build
some
more
in
some
soft
areas
that
we've
noticed
over
the
last
two
years.
so
we
actually
may
put
up
some
"additional,"
but
we
will
have
it
"completed,"
everything
we
"said,"
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
and
we've
reduced
illegal
border
crossings
by
60%
since
this
time
last
year.
and
if
we
keep
going
at
the
"rate,"
it'll
be
about
85%
in
about
two
months.
so
it's
a
great
honor.
and
you
know
what?
your
community
is
much
"safer,"
you
see
the
"difference,"
it's
a
much
safer
place
to
be.
but
more
important
than
these
numbers
is
the
fact
that
we've
ended
catch
and
release.
you
know
what
catch
and
release
is?
these
great
men
and
women
catch
"somebody,"
maybe
a
"murderer,"
maybe
a
"rapist,"
maybe
a
"trafficker,"
they
catch
"somebody,"
take
his
"name,"
take
his
number
and
they
release
them
into
our
country.
and
they
"say,"
"\"come"
back
in
four
"years,"
you
have
a
"trial.\""
no
more.
we
take
them
out.
we
bring
them
out.
and
nobody
said
that
was
possible
because
i
couldn't
have
gotten
it
through
the
democrats
because
they
don't
like
that.
so
we
have
people
coming
in
to
this
"country,"
some
great
"people,"
some
really
bad
people
too.
and
i
mean
murders
and
i
mean
"rapist,"
i
mean
really
bad
people
and
they
don't
get
in
and
they
don't
get
back.
when
we
bring
them
back
to
their
"country,"
could
be
mexico
"also,"
they
don't
come
back.
under
the
obama
"biden,"
i
call
it
"obiden,"
under
the
obiden
"administration,"
our
agents
were
ordered
to
ignore
the
law
and
release
illegal
aliens
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands.
and
by
the
"way,"
mark
"morgan,"
where's
the
great
mark
morgan?
he's
around
here
someplace.
mark
morgan
has
been
so
"incredible,"
one
of
our
"executives,"
he
"said,"
"\"we"
never
built
the
cages.
those
cages
were
built
in
2014
by
"obama.\""
we
never
the
"cages,"
they
were
built
by
obama
and
the
fake
news
is
constantly
saying
that
i
built
cages
for
children.
i
didn't
build
them.
they
were
built
in
2014.
there
was
a
headline
in
time
magazine
about
the
cage
and
somebody
called
in
that
built
it.
they
"said,"
"\"he"
didn't
build
"it,"
we
built
that
for
the
obama
"administration.\""
but
they
don't
"stop,"
they
keep
calling
"it,"
they
say
i
built
the
cages.
you'll
hear
it
in
one
of
the
debates.
they'll
"say,"
"\"you"
built
cages
"president.\""
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
i
didn't
build
cages.
that
was
built
by
"obama.\""
under
the
trump
"administration,"
if
you
cross
our
border
"illegally,"
you
are
quickly
apprehended
and
swiftly
returned
back
home.
we
are
proudly
defending
the
job
safety
and
security
of
the
american
"people,"
which
is
what
i
promised
to
do.
nobody
told
me
it
was
going
to
be
this
hard.
nobody
told
me
i
was
going
to
have
the
democrats
go
totally
crazy.
this
was
like
a
life
and
death
war.
you
know
why
they
don't
talk
about
it
anymore?
because
they
know
it's
bad
"politics,"
because
they
know
having
a
"wall,"
they
can't
win
that
one.
so
they
just
"say,"
"\"let's"
forget
it
ever
happened.'
because
we
won
and
they
"say,"
"\"let's"
"forget.\""
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
that
includes
the
millions
of
incredible
hispanic
americans
who
follow
our
"laws,"
uplift
our
community
and
protect
our
"nation,"
in
uniform.
half
of
all
border
patrol
agents
are
hispanic
"americans,"
i
was
just
with
them.
and
today
i
salute
each
and
every
one
of
those
true
american
heroes
and
that's
what
they
are.
and
nobody
understands
the
border
better
than
hispanics.
they
know
what's
"good,"
what's
bad.
they
don't
want
bad
people
coming
into
our
"country,"
taking
their
"jobs,"
taking
their
"homes,"
causing
crime.
hispanic
americans
are
the
people
that
are
most
in
favor
of
what
we're
doing
on
the
border
because
they
understand
it.
they
understand
it
better
than
anybody.
with
the
help
of
these
"patriots,"
we've
stopped
the
rampant
asylum
"fraud,"
shut
down
the
human
smugglers
and
we're
finding
the
drug
"dealers,"
"traffickers,"
"predators,"
and
we're
throwing
them
to
hell
in
jail
or
sending
them
back
home.
"ms-13,"
for
the
first
time
that
you've
ever
seen
"this,"
ms-13
is
totally
on
the
run.
many
of
its
leaders
are
right
now
behind
bars
and
we're
deporting
its
members
in
record
numbers
we've
never
reported.
i
can't
believe
how
many
there
are.
but
if
biden
"wins,"
it
will
be
a
giant
jail
break
for
ms-13
and
vicious
criminal
gangs.
china
wants
him
to
win
so
badly.
iran
wants
him
to
win
so
badly.
when
we
"win,"
i'll
have
a
deal
with
the
red
within
a
"month,"
"watch,"
because
they're
dying
to
make
a
deal.
but
that
last
hope
that
biden
will
"win,"
they
will
own
our
"country,"
"china,"
they
will
own
our
country.
we
made
such
a
great
deal.
last
week
they
had
the
largest
order
of
corn
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
the
largest
single
order.
then
they
did
it
again.
you
know
why
they're
doing
that?
because
they
know
i'm
"angry,"
because
they
know
i
don't
care
so
much
anymore.
we
made
a
great
trade
"deal,"
but
i
don't
care.
but
it
shows
you
how
smart
they
"are,"
doug.
another
with
normal
brain
"power,"
they'd
"say,"
"\"well,"
i'm
not
going
to
buy
any
more
"corn.\""
that's
good.
and
we'll
just
"decouple,"
thank
you
very
much.
but
they
go
the
opposite.
they
buy
so
"much,"
good
record
"numbers,"
soybeans
record
numbers.
last
"week,"
biggest
"ever,"
42%
of
our
farmers
crop
is
now
"china,"
over
the
last
little
while.
you
know
why?
because
they
don't
want
bad
things
to
"happen,"
that's
why.
so
they're
very
smart.
when
i
have
every
farmer
in
the
country
calling
and
"saying,"
"\"please"
don't
do
"anything.\""
they're
"very,"
very
"smart,"
but
we
can
never
forget
what
china
did
to
this
country
and
did
to
the
world.
the
historic
achievements
that
i've
discussed
today
are
only
a
slim
fraction
of
the
extraordinary
accomplishment
that
we've
all
done
together
in
the
last
four
years.
here's
just
a
short
list
of
our
landmarks.
really
they
are
"landmarks,"
true
landmarks.
we
instituted
a
national
security
travel
ban
on
the
world's
most
dangerous
"regions,"
including
jihadist
"regions,"
keeping
terrorists
and
extremists
out
of
our
country.
everyone
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
so
"bad.\""
remember
when
they
"said,"
"\"oh,"
that's
so
"bad.\""
i
don't
think
it's
so
bad
at
all.
we
won
the
travel
ban.
the
fake
news
said
we
didn't
because
we
lost
in
the
lower
"court,"
we
lost
in
the
second
court
and
we
won
in
the
supreme
court.
so
they
said
we
lost.
can
you
believe
it?
they
said
we
lost
"debbie,"
because
we
lost
the
first
"two,"
but
we
won
in
the
supreme
"court,"
so
they
"said,"
"\"they"
"lost.\""
i
"guess,"
technically
they're
"right,"
we
lost
when
it
didn't
matter.
but
we
have
it.
we
have
a
great
travel
ban
now
for
countries
that
are
not
countries
where
we
want
the
people
coming
in.
over
the
last
three
"years,"
ice
officers
have
made
over
"380,000"
arrests
of
aliens
with
criminal
"records,"
including
those
charged
or
convicted
of
over
"145,000"
"assaults,"
"40,000"
sex
crimes
and
"5,"
800
murders.
over
the
last
three
"years,"
border
patrol
and
ice
have
seized
over
two
million
pounds
of
"fentanyl,"
"heroin,"
"meth,"
and
other
deadly
narcotics.
and
you
see
it
all
the
time.
we
stripped
federal
grant
funding
from
deadly
sanctuary
cities.
they
want
to
have
a
sanctuary
"city,"
not
going
to
be
like
the
old
days.
we
canceled
the
lawless
policies
of
the
previous
administration
and
empowered
border
agents
and
ice
officers
to
do
their
jobs
and
proudly
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america.
we
removed
"20,000"
gang
"members,"
including
"4,500,"
ms-13.
that's
pretty
good.
who
would
ever
think
there's
that
many?
i
entered
into
three
landmark
agreements
with
honduras
and
el
salvador
and
guatemala
to
end
the
abuse
of
the
asylum
system.
we
cut
down
that
payment
that
i
was
talking
about
substantially
and
they're
still
very
happy
and
they
are
working
with
us
very
well
and
that
includes
mexico.
right
"now,"
mexico
has
"27,000"
of
their
soldiers
on
our
southern
"border,"
helping
us
to
guard
our
southern
border.
and
we're
giving
you
the
tools
to
do
the
job
that
you
signed
up
for.
that's
what
we've
done.
i
entered
into
a
historic
partnership
with
"mexico,"
known
as
the
migrant
protection
"protocols,"
to
safely
return
asylum
seekers
to
"mexico,"
while
awaiting
hearings
in
the
united
states.
you
know
about
that.
we
had
to
have
them
in
the
united
states
and
we
captured
"them,"
we
had
to
keep
him
here.
i
"said,"
"\"no,"
"no,"
we
don't
want
them
here.
we
want
them
"outside.\""
we
got
sued
all
over
the
place
that
we
won.
so
now
they
don't
come
into
the
united
"states,"
they
can
wait
outside.
for
the
first
time
"ever,"
the
united
states
is
now
exercising
our
full
legal
authority
to
expedited
removal.
we
don't
have
to
go
through
years
and
years
of
litigation.
you
need
perry
mason
to
try
and
win.
we
ended
the
obama
biden
policy
of
giving
work
permits
to
newly
"arriving,"
illegal
aliens.
think
of
that
one.
we
established
the
national
vetting
"center,"
the
most
advanced
visa
screening
"system,"
anywhere
in
the
world.
we
know
so
much
about
the
people
coming
in.
we
know
the
good
and
we
know
the
bad.
we've
suspended
refugee.
…
good
and
we
know
the
bad.
we've
suspended
refugee
resettlements
from
the
world's
most
dangerous
"regions,"
because
nothing
is
more
important
than
keeping
america
safe.
to
"me,"
that's
number
one.
we've
made
historic
progress
to
crack
down
on
visa
overstays.
you
know
all
about
that.
they
overstay
for
years.
they
"say,"
"\"maybe"
a
"night,"
maybe
two
"nights.\""
"well,"
five
years
"later,"
you
catch
them.
"no,"
we
ended
it.
we
issued
strict
sanctions
on
countries
that
failed
to
take
back
their
own
criminals.
we
have
many
countries
beyond
the
four
that
i
"mentioned,"
the
three
plus
"one,"
many
countries.
they
all
take
them
back
now.
"before,"
they
weren't
taking
them
back
at
all.
the
last
administration
simply
released
these
criminals.
we're
making
sure
they
go
home
and
we're
making
sure
they
stay
home.
we
don't
want
them.
we
issued
regulations
to
stop
the
horrible
practice
of
birth
tourism.
you
know
what
that
"is,"
right?
anchor
"babies,"
you
know
"that,"
right?
anchor
babies.
have
a
baby
in
our
country
and
you
stay
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
congratulations.
you're
a
citizen
for
90
years.
then
you
bring
in
your
family.
you
bring
in
your
"family,"
right?
no.
no
good.
i
implemented
a
historic
public
charge
regulation
to
finally
and
fully
enforce
the
federal
requirement
that
newcomers
to
our
country
must
be
financially
"self-sufficient,"
they
cannot
accept
welfare
for
at
least
five
years.
to
protect
our
country
and
our
agents
during
the
"pandemic,"
my
administration
took
immediate
action
to
ensure
the
safe
and
rapid
return
of
all
illegal
aliens.
we
brought
them
back.
we
have
very
few
in
our
country
now.
we
brought
them
"back,"
can
you
believe
it?
to
protect
us
"workers,"
i
suspended
the
entry
of
low
wage
workers
that
threatened
all
of
your
"jobs,"
american
"jobs,"
and
we're
finalizing
the
new
h-1b
regulations
to
permanently
end
the
displacement
of
us
workers.
in
january
after
the
china
"virus,"
after
the
"outbreak,"
after
the
"outbreak,"
the
china
virus
"outbreak,"
it
came
from
"wuhan,"
right?
i
swiftly
implemented
a
travel
ban
on
china
and
i
was
criticized.
"biden,"
opposed
the
ban.
he
"said,"
"\"i"
oppose
the
"ban.\""
he
had
no
idea
what
the
hell
he
was
doing.
why
do
you
oppose
"it,"
joe?
i
don't
know.
they
told
me
to
say
that.
if
we
had
listened
to
sleepy
joe
"biden,"
hundreds
of
thousands
of
additional
american
lives
would
have
been
lost.
we
did
a
good
thing.
that
was
in
"january,"
i
imposed
"it,"
very
early.
a
month
"later,"
pelosi
and
all
these
people
"said,"
"\"oh"
"no,"
let
people
come
in.
we
"can't.\""
we
imposed
it
because
china
was
heavily
infected.
then
i
imposed
it
in
europe
"also,"
heavily
infected
with
italy
and
france
and
spain.
compare
our
achievements
with
the
insane
and
lethal
policies
that
biden
and
bernie
sanders
want.
the
entire
biden…
harris.
how
about
her?
is
she
a
great
one?
is
she?
by
the
"way,"
you
talk
about
guns.
she
wants
no
2nd
amendment.
she
wants
to
raise
your
taxes
to
a
level
you'll
be
paying
your
government
back
for
a
long
time.
she
is
not
the
right
"pick,"
but
she
was
my
number
one
draft
pick.
they
asked
me
that.
why
do
you
think?
i
"said,"
"\"i'm"
very
"happy.\""
they
thought
i
was
happy.
they
thought
i
was
happy
for
him.
"no,"
i
was
happy
for
me.
the
biden-harris
plan
is
a
step
by
step
recipe
for
abolishing
america's
borders.
in
the

you
believe
that?
we
just
got
rid
of
it.
free
all
illegal
aliens
from
federal
detention
and
close

this
would
make
removing
illegal
aliens
totally
"impossible,"
and
you
would
have
"murderers,"
"killers,"
rapists
in
your
midst.
i
don't
think
so.
immediately
suspend
all
"removals,"
triggering
a
tidal
wave
"of,"
really
a
"flood,"
if
you
"think,"
a
flood
all
across

border.

over
again

terminate

we
have
enacted
against

they
want
to
do
things
that
nobody
thought
was
even
possible
to
contemplate.
"now,"
this
is
all
simple
and
i
really
respect
because
so
far
i've
only
seen
about
four
or
five
people
go
down.
because
it
is
hot
in
here.
but
i
will
tell
you
this…
it's
120.
you
know
what
i
said
before?
think
of
yourself
at
a
great
"spa,"
great
"sauna,"
where
it's
120
degrees
and
we
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
be
there.
you
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money.
getting
off
the
"border,"
getting
off
illegal
"protection,"
all
of
"that,"
we
are
going
to
lower
your
taxes
further.
we
gave
you
the
biggest
tax
decrease
in
the
history
of…
the
biggest
tax
decrease
in
the
history
of
our
country.
we
decreased
your
taxes
more
than
anybody
has
ever
done
and
we're
doing
more
because
that's
going
to
spell
growth
and
that's
what
happened.
companies
are
moving
in
like
nobody
has
seen
before.
so
we're
doing
that.
massive
additional
regulation
cuts.
we've
cut
regulations
more
than
any
president
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
whether
it's
four
"years,"
eight
"years,"
or
in
one
"case,"
more.
i
told
you
"already,"
our
military
is
the
best
it's
ever
been.
it's
got
$2.5
trillion
worth
of
"new,"
beautiful
jets
and
equipment
and
rockets
and
everything.
"hopefully,"
we
never
have
to
use
it.
our
nuclear
"arsenal,"
and
"hopefully,"
hopefully
we
never
have
to
even
look
at
"it,"
our
nuclear
arsenal
is
at
a
level
that
it's
never
ever
been
"before,"
and
we
have
to
have
it
"there,"
but
we
never
want
to
use
it.
so
we
have
done
things
not
only
on
the
"border,"
the
border
is
one
"element,"
and
to
me
it's
very
important.
something
that
they
always
say
about
a
"president,"
the
most
important
thing
a
president
can
do
is
the
appointment
of
federal
judges
and
supreme
court
justices.
so
by
the
end
of
"our,"
of
not
"my,"
our
first
"term,"
we
will
have
appointed
300
federal
judges
and
appeals
court
"judges,"
and
two
supreme
court
justices.
when
it
comes
to
2nd
"amendment,"
when
it
comes
to
"life,"
when
it
comes
to
a
lot
of
things
that
you
people
live
"for,"
if
you
don't
have
the
supreme
court
and
if
you
don't
have
the
courts
in
your
"side,"
you
can
forget
it.
the
next
"president,"
i
"think,"
will
pick
"two,"
"three,"
or
even
four
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
they
can
be
on
the
court
for
40
to
50
years.
you
pick
them
young.
they
could
be
on
there
for
40
to
50
years.
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
consequential
presidency.
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
"important,"
and
i
never
thought
i'd
say
it
because
of
what
happened
four
years
"ago,"
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
important
election
of
your
life.
so
i
just
want
to…
thank
you.
i
just
want
to
say
stay
"healthy,"
stay
"sharp,"
be
careful.
be
very
careful.
go
out
and
work
like
hell.
we
need
every
single
vote
that
we
can
get
because
it's
probably
going
to
be
close.
i
always
assume
it's
going
to
be
close.
they
have
these
"suppression,"
the
fakers
back
"there,"
they
have
the
suppression
polls
where
they
interview
many
more
democrats
than
they
do
republicans.
doug
and
i
were
talking
about
it
and
they
take
out
registered
voters.
it's
not
registered.
they
"say,"
"\"most"
likely
to
vote
"voters.\""
that's
"what,"
most
likely
"registered,"
they're
"dead,"
they're
"old,"
they're
not
going
to
"go,"
they're
not
going
to
do
anything.
be
careful
with
your
"ballots,"
but
get
out
there.
november
3rd
is
the
biggest
"date,"
one
of
the
biggest
dates
in
your
"life,"
in
many
"cases,"
"frankly,"
it's
the
most
important
date
of
your
life.
one
other
thing
we've
done
lot.
we've
gotten
rid
of
a
lot
of
nonsense
from
"obama,"
like
the
paris
accord
that
costs
us
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
and
gave
us
nothing.
we've
gotten
rid
of
so
many
different
things
that
you
have
no
"idea,"
but
you
know
what?
if
we
don't
"win,"
they
can
put
it
"back,"
and
with
the
things
that
we
did
put
"in,"
which
are
"many,"

many
"things,"
many
"things,"
our
"military,"
our
"vets,"
"everything,"
with
all
of
the
things
that
we
put
"in,"
it's
like
a
"tree,"
it
takes
a
little
while
to
grab
on.
you
transplant
it.
it's
got
to
grab
on.
if
we
have
four
more
"years,"
there's
nothing
that
they
can
do.
our
country
is
sailing.

country
is
sailing.

you

never

that

that
i
can
tell

the
prime

knows
that.
on
this
"day,"
i'm
happy
to
report
that
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
india
is
stronger
than
ever
before.
the
ties
between
our
two
nations
are
grounded
in

and
our
shared
commitment
to
democracy.
we
are
free
nations
with
great
faith
and
a
fierce
devotion
to
our
national
independence.
we
are
governed
by
the
rule
of
"law,"
guided
by
commitment
to
"justice,"
and
strengthened
by
our
love
of
liberty.
our
two
national
constitutions
both
begin
with
the
same
three
beautiful
"words,"
"\"we"
the
"people.\""
that
means
that
in
america
amd
india
"alike,"
we
"honor,"
"respect,"
"trust,"
empower
and
fight
for
the
citizens
we
proudly
serve.
under
prime
minister
modi's
"leadership,"
the
world
is
witnessing
a
strong
sovereign
and
thriving
republic
of
india.
in
a
single
"decade,"
with
the
help
of
prime
minister
modi's
pro-growth
"reforms,"
india
has
lifted
nearly
300
million
people
out
of
poverty
and
that
is
an
incredible
number.
incredible.
that's
incredible.
in
the
next
"decade,"
140
million
indian
households
will
rise
to
the
middle
class.
in
both
india
and
the
united
"states,"
we're
seeing
something
really
remarkable.
our
people
are
prospering
like
never
before
because
we
are
slashing
bureaucracy
and
cutting
job
killing
red
tape.
in
the
united
"states,"
thanks
to
our
massive
tax
cuts
and
all
of
our
great
senators
and
congressmen
and
women
that
are
here
today
and
pro
worker
"policies,"
our
economy
is
breaking
one
record
after
another.
since
my
"election,"
we
have
created
over
6
million
new
jobs.
we
have
created
over
"750,000"
jobs
right
here
in
texas
and
very
"importantly,"
that
includes
"70,000"
new
texas
manufacturing
jobs.
they
said
that
couldn't
be
done.
unemployment
…
think
of
this.
unemployment
in
texas
is
currently
at
the
lowest
rate
ever
recorded
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
and
unemployment
in
the
united
states
has
just
reached
the
lowest
level
in
over
51
years
and
very
soon
we
think
that
will
be
broken
to
be
a
historic
number.
unemployment
among
african
"americans,"
asian
"americans,"
and
hispanic
americans
have
all
reached
their
lowest
levels
in
the
history
of
our
country.
over
the
last
two
"years,"
the
unemployment
rate
among
indian
americans
dropped
by
nearly
33
and
one
third
percent.
wages
are
"rising,"
incomes
are
"soaring,"
and
inequality
is
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
in
"many,"
many
years.
in
the
past
12
months
"alone,"
the
average
worker
has
taken
home
"$1,000"
extra
in
rising
wages
and
over
"$3,000"
with
tax
cuts
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
we've
done.
and
for
the
first
time
in
"history,"
most
new
hires
of
prime
working
age
are
minorities
and
women.
first
time
that's
ever
happened.
through
our
pledge
to
america's
"workers,"
we
have
secured
commitments
for
nearly
14
million
employment
and
training
opportunities
for
american
workers
done
through
our
great
american
companies.
we
passed
the
biggest
tax
cuts
and
the
biggest
tax
reforms
in
the
history
of
our
country.
we
slashed
a
record
number
of
job
killing
"regulations,"
giving
the
average
american
household
more
than
"$3,000"
every
year
and
never
in
the
history
of
our
"country,"
no
matter
how
long
the
"presidency,"
have
regulations
been
cut
to
this
extent.
"everyday,"
the
indian
american
community
is
helping
to
strengthen
our
country
and
build
our
future.
indian
americans
are
pioneering
groundbreaking
medicines
to
save
countless
lives.
they're
developing
revolutionary
technology
that
is
changing
the
world
and
they're
founding
new
businesses
that
provide
jobs
to
thousands
of
our
fellow
citizens.
prime
minister
"modi,"
i
look
forward
to
working
with
you
to
make
our
nations
even
more
prosperous
than
ever
before.
and
that's
what's
happening.
the
economic
miracles
taking
place
today
are
just
beginning.
here
in
the
united
"states,"
there
has
never
been
a
better
time
to
"hire,"
"invest,"
"grow,"
and
pursue
your
dreams.
indian
companies
employ
tens
of
thousands
of
americans
across
a
range
of
"industries,"
including
american
steel.
in
2018
india's
jsw
steel
announced
that
it
would
invest
up
to
$500
million
to
revitalize
a
shuttered
steel
plant
in
the
great
state
of
ohio.
and
we
welcome
india's
growing
investments
right
here
in
the
lone
star
state.
nations
around
the
world
are
investing
in
the
united
states
because
they
know
we
have
the
best
economy
and
the
best
workers
in
the
world.
they
have
never
invested
in
our
country
like
they
are
today.
and
we
want
to
thank
everybody
and
india
has
never
invested
in
the
united
states
like
it
is
doing
today.
and
i
want
to
say
it's
reciprocal
because
we're
doing
the
same
thing
in
india.
on
"tuesday,"
two
japanese
"companies,"
toyota
and
"aisin,"
announced
a
combined
investment
of
almost
$800
"million,"
which
will
create
over
900
new
jobs
right
here
in
texas.
at
the
same
"time,"
we
are
working
to
expand
american
exports
to
"india,"
one
of
the
world's
fastest
growing
markets.
we
are
committed
to
ensuring
the
indian
people
have
access
to
the
finest
goods
in
the
"world,"
product
stamped
with
a
beautiful
"phrase,"
"\"made"
in
the
"usa.\""
and
very
"soon,"
india
will
have
access
to
another
world
class
american
"product,"
nba
basketball.
"wow,"
sounds
good.
that
sounds
good.
next
week
thousands
of
people
will
gather
in
mumbai
to
watch
the
first
ever
nba
basketball
game
in
india.
am
i
"invited,"
mr.
prime
minister?
i
may
come.
be
careful.
i
may
come.
when
it
comes
to
expanding
our
commercial
"relationship,"
no
issue
is
more
important
than
energy
security.
for
the
first
time
"ever,"
the
united
states
is
the
number
one
producer
of
both
oil
and
natural
gas
on
planet
earth
and
number
one
by
"far,"
with
much
of
it
coming
right
here
from
the
great
state
of
texas.
that
means
more

"yesterday,"
we
were
thrilled
to
hear
about
the
indian
company
petronas
pledge
to
purchase
up
to
5
million
tons
of
lng
per
year
from
the
united
"states,"
which
could
lead
to
billions
of
dollars
of
lng
exports
to
india
in
the
coming
years.
and
we
have
plenty
of
it.
over
the
last
"year,"
crude
exports
to
india
have
grown
by
400%
and
liquefied
natural
gas
exports
continue
to
soar
at
record
numbers.
thank
you.
these
tremendous
exports
not
only
expand
employment
in
"america,"
but
they
increase
freedom
and
security
for
india.
to
keep
our
nation
"safe,"
the
united
states
and
india
forging
an
even
stronger
security
partnership.
us
defense
sales
to
india
have
also
reached
$18
billion
over
the
past
decade.
we
make
the
greatest
defense
mechanisms
and
equipment
anywhere
in
the
world
and
india
knows
that
well.
we're
looking
forward
to
concluding
several
new
defense
deals
very
soon.
there
are
a
lot
of
them
in
the
works.
here
in
"america,"
we're
creating
the
united
states
space
force
and
we're
working
closely
with
india
to
enhance
space
cooperation.
in
"november,"
the
united
states
and
india
will
demonstrate
a
dramatic
progress
of
our
defense
"relationship,"
holding
the
first
ever
tri-service
military
exercise
between
our
nations.
it's
called
tiger

good
"name,"

a
good
name.
very
good
name.
"today,"
we
honor
all
of
the
brave
american
and
indian
military
service
members
who
work
together
to
safeguard
our
freedom.
we
stand
proudly
in
defense
of
liberty
and
we
are
committed
to
protecting
innocent
civilians
from
the
threat
of
radical
islamic
terrorism.
thank
you.
both
india
and
the
united
states
also
understand
that
to
keep
our
communities
"safe,"
we
must
protect
our
borders.
since
taking
"office,"
my
administration
has
launched
a
far-reaching
effort
to
improve
screening
and
vetting
of
applications
for
entry.
we
are
working
hard
to
ensure
that
those
who
would
threaten
our
security
are
denied
admission
into
our
country
and
we
are
enhancing
our
vetting
efforts
like-
…
"country,"
and
we
are
enhancing
our
vetting
efforts
like
never
"before,"
not
even
close.
we're
doing
it
on
a
daily
"basis,"
and
we'll
soon
be
setting
records
in
every
one
of
the
aspects
of
border
security.
border
security
is
vital
to
the
united
states.
border
security
is
vital
to
india.
we
understand
that.
we
are
further
taking
unprecedented
action
to
finally
secure
our
southern
border
and
stop
illegal
immigration.
i
want
to
thank
the
president
of
"mexico,"
who
right
now
has
"27,000"
soldiers
on
our
southern
border.
it's
been
incredible
what's
taken
place
in
a
short
period
of
time.
illegal
immigration
is
deeply
unfair
to
millions
of
wonderful
legal
immigrants
who
work
"hard,"
pay
their
"taxes,"
follow
our
"rules,"
and
obey
our
laws.
yet
there
are
those
in
washington
who
would
raid
your
healthcare
to
…
free
benefits.
they
want
to
fund
free
benefits
to
those
who
enter
our
country
illegally.
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
because
if
we
don't
do
"it,"
they
won't
come.
i
will
never
allow
politicians
to
take
away
your
healthcare
or
give
it
to
illegal
immigrants.
my
administration
believes
our
first
duty
is
to
the
highest
loyalty
of
all.
we
must
always
be
for
the
american
"people,"
whether
it's
"african-american,"
"hispanic-american,"
indian-american.
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
citizens
first.
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
indian-american
citizens
before
we
take
care
of
illegal
immigrants
that
want
to
pour
into
our
country.
we
want
to
build
a
nation
where
every
"family,"
immigrant
and
"us-born,"
can
live
in
a
safe
community
with
access
to
great
"school,"
work
in
a
job
you
"love,"
and
have
the
best
chance
to
reach
the
american
dream.
we
love
the
american
dream.
just
in
"concluding,"
i
want
to
say
that
america
has
always
been
a
nation
of
pioneers
and
"patriots,"
risk-takers
and
free
"thinkers,"
and
dedicated
workers
who
have
honed
a
"trade,"
mastered
their
"field,"
and
teach
their
children
to
always
give
their
"very,"
very
best.
every
day
indian-americans
help
write
the
story
of
american
"greatness,"
and
everyone
here
today
has
a
crucial
part
to
play
in
building
an
even
grander
and
greater
american
and
indian
future.
to
help
achieve
that
exciting
"vision,"
we
are
strengthening
our
cherished
bonds
with
the
nation
of
"india,"
and
we
are
proving
the
awesome
power
of
democracy
and
unlimited
potential
of
free
people.
"together,"
we
will
continue
to
deepen
the
ties
between
our
nations.
we
will
honor
the
faith
of
dignity
of
our
"citizens,"
and
we
will
achieve
incredible
advancements
for
our
"people,"
for
our
"children,"
and
for
the
world.
we
will
discover
new
cures
and
save
millions
of
lives.
we
will
advance
cutting-edge
technologies
and
lift
millions
and
millions
of
people
out
of
poverty.
we
will
pioneer
new
frontiers
in
"space,"
working
"together,"
raising
the
sights
of
humanity.
we
will
uphold
our
"values,"
defend
our
"liberty,"
and
control
our
destiny.
the
united
states
and
india
will
make
our
nations
"stronger,"
our
people
"wealthier,"
our
dreamers
"bigger,"
and
our
future
brighter
than
ever
"before,"
and
it
won't
even
be
close.
i
want
to
thank
everybody
for
being
here.
i
want
to
especially
thank
a
great
